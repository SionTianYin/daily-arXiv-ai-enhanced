### [1] [CoBA: Counterbias Text Augmentation for Mitigating Various Spurious Correlations via Semantic Triples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21083)
*Kyohoon Jin,Juhwan Choi,Jungmin Yun,Junho Lee,Soojin Jang,Youngbin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出CoBA框架，通过语义三元组分解和选择性修改来生成反偏差数据，解决深度学习模型对虚假相关性的依赖问题，提升模型性能和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性，使用非目标特征进行预测，导致性能下降和泛化能力差

Method: CoBA反偏差增强框架：将文本分解为主谓宾三元组，选择性修改这些三元组以破坏虚假相关性，然后重构文本生成反偏差数据

Result: 实验表明CoBA不仅能提升下游任务性能，还能有效减少偏差并增强分布外鲁棒性

Conclusion: CoBA提供了一个通用且鲁棒的解决方案，有效应对虚假相关性带来的挑战

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in
training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions.
Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on
unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of
counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which
simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and
enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias
Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level:
first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively
modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the
text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that
mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively
reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a
versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

### [2] [Mapping Toxic Comments Across Demographics: A Dataset from German Public Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21084)
*Jan Fillies,Michael Peter Hoffmann,Rebecca Reichel,Roman Salzwedel,Sven Bodemer,Adrian Paschke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个大规模德语毒性数据集，包含平台提供的年龄估计，揭示了不同年龄段用户的毒性言论模式差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有毒性语音数据集缺乏人口统计背景，限制了我们对不同年龄群体在线交流方式的理解

Method: 与德国公共服务内容网络funk合作，收集Instagram、TikTok和YouTube的评论，使用预定义毒性关键词筛选，结合人工标注和最先进语言模型进行标注，包含3,024条人工标注和30,024条LLM标注的匿名评论

Result: 16.7%的评论被标记为有问题，发现年龄相关的毒性言论模式差异：年轻用户偏爱表达性语言，年长用户更多参与虚假信息和贬低行为

Conclusion: 该数据集为研究跨人口统计的语言变异提供了新机会，支持开发更公平和年龄感知的内容审核系统

Abstract: A lack of demographic context in existing toxic speech datasets limits our
understanding of how different age groups communicate online. In collaboration
with funk, a German public service content network, this research introduces
the first large-scale German dataset annotated for toxicity and enriched with
platform-provided age estimates. The dataset includes 3,024 human-annotated and
30,024 LLM-annotated anonymized comments from Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube.
To ensure relevance, comments were consolidated using predefined toxic
keywords, resulting in 16.7\% labeled as problematic. The annotation pipeline
combined human expertise with state-of-the-art language models, identifying key
categories such as insults, disinformation, and criticism of broadcasting fees.
The dataset reveals age-based differences in toxic speech patterns, with
younger users favoring expressive language and older users more often engaging
in disinformation and devaluation. This resource provides new opportunities for
studying linguistic variation across demographics and supports the development
of more equitable and age-aware content moderation systems.

*Zezhong Jin,Shubhang Desai,Xu Chen,Biyi Fang,Zhuoyi Huang,Zhe Li,Chong-Xin Gan,Xiao Tu,Man-Wai Mak,Yan Lu,Shujie Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TrInk是基于Transformer的笔迹生成模型，通过引入缩放位置编码和高斯记忆掩码，在IAM-OnDB数据集上相比之前方法实现了字符错误率降低35.56%和词错误率降低29.66%的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决笔迹生成中全局依赖关系捕捉和文本-笔画对齐的问题，需要开发能够更好处理这些挑战的模型架构。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TrInk模型，在交叉注意力模块中引入缩放位置编码和高斯记忆掩码来改善文本与生成笔画点的对齐，并设计了主客观评估流程来全面评估生成笔迹的可读性和风格一致性。

Result: 在IAM-OnDB数据集上，相比之前方法实现了字符错误率(CER)降低35.56%，词错误率(WER)降低29.66%的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: TrInk模型通过创新的注意力机制设计，在笔迹生成任务中取得了显著的性能改进，证明了Transformer架构在捕捉笔迹生成全局依赖关系方面的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose TrInk, a Transformer-based model for ink
generation, which effectively captures global dependencies. To better
facilitate the alignment between the input text and generated stroke points, we
introduce scaled positional embeddings and a Gaussian memory mask in the
cross-attention module. Additionally, we design both subjective and objective
evaluation pipelines to comprehensively assess the legibility and style
consistency of the generated handwriting. Experiments demonstrate that our
Transformer-based model achieves a 35.56\% reduction in character error rate
(CER) and an 29.66% reduction in word error rate (WER) on the IAM-OnDB dataset
compared to previous methods. We provide an demo page with handwriting samples

### [5] [How Does Cognitive Bias Affect Large Language Models? A Case Study on the Anchoring Effect in Price Negotiation Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21137)
*Yoshiki Takenami,Yin Jou Huang,Yugo Murawaki,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在价格谈判中存在锚定效应，推理模型能减轻这种效应，但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在现实应用中的认知偏见，特别是锚定效应对价格谈判可靠性的影响

Method: 使用卖家LLM代理应用锚定效应，通过客观和主观指标评估谈判结果，分析推理和人格因素与锚定效应的关系

Result: LLMs像人类一样受锚定效应影响，推理模型较不易受影响（长思维链减轻效应），但人格特质与锚定效应敏感性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解LLMs的认知偏见，推动LLMs在社会中安全负责任的应用

Abstract: Cognitive biases, well-studied in humans, can also be observed in LLMs,
affecting their reliability in real-world applications. This paper investigates
the anchoring effect in LLM-driven price negotiations. To this end, we
instructed seller LLM agents to apply the anchoring effect and evaluated
negotiations using not only an objective metric but also a subjective metric.
Experimental results show that LLMs are influenced by the anchoring effect like
humans. Additionally, we investigated the relationship between the anchoring
effect and factors such as reasoning and personality. It was shown that
reasoning models are less prone to the anchoring effect, suggesting that the
long chain of thought mitigates the effect. However, we found no significant
correlation between personality traits and susceptibility to the anchoring
effect. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of cognitive biases
in LLMs and to the realization of safe and responsible application of LLMs in
society.

### [6] [Can Multimodal LLMs Solve the Basic Perception Problems of Percept-V?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21143)
*Samrajnee Ghosh,Naman Agarwal,Hemanshu Garg,Chinmay Mittal,Mausam,Parag Singla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Percept-V数据集评估多模态大语言模型在基础视觉感知任务上的表现，发现随着问题复杂度增加，模型性能显著下降，且不同认知技能的难度存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但在基础视觉感知任务上的性能缺乏系统评估，需要构建专门数据集来测试其基本感知能力。

Method: 创建包含7200张程序生成图像的Percept-V数据集，分为30个类别测试不同视觉感知技能，并在GPT-4o、Gemini、Claude等先进模型上进行测试。

Result: 实验显示所有测试模型在基础感知任务上表现不佳，随着问题复杂度增加，性能显著下降，且不同认知技能的难度差异明显。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在复杂任务上的优异表现不能代表其在基础视觉感知任务上的能力，需要进一步改进模型的基础感知能力。

Abstract: The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
garnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers
like coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have
been done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over
uncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To
address this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a
total of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each
testing a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed
datasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test
the perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on
state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their
performance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,
our experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with
increasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the
performances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in
accuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some
skills to be more difficult than others.

Conclusion: 论文提出了向闭环系统的范式转变，基于Sci-LLMs的自主代理将主动实验、验证并为动态演化的知识库做出贡献，为构建可信赖、持续演化的AI系统提供了路线图，加速科学发现。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is
represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress
is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a
comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs
as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We
formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of
scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and
domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general
natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs,
from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse
scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270
pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands --
heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require
representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal
reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a
shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with
advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent
issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving
semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline
a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on
Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving
knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building
trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that
function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

*Muskan Saraf,Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni,Justin Beaudry,Hossein Abedi,Tom Bush*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM评估存在严重标签偏见，Claude标签显著提升评分而Gemini标签降低评分，错误标签可导致排名反转和50个百分点偏好变化，需要盲评或多模型评估协议确保公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地用于评估输出，但其判断可能受到偏见影响，需要研究自评估和跨模型评估中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用ChatGPT、Gemini和Claude三种模型，在无标签、真实标签和两种错误标签条件下，通过整体偏好投票和Coherence、Informativeness、Conciseness三个维度的质量评分来评估博客文章。

Result: 发现明显的非对称偏见：Claude标签始终提升分数，Gemini标签始终降低分数；错误标签经常逆转排名，偏好投票变化达50个百分点，质量评分变化达12个百分点；Gemini在真实标签下自评分崩溃，Claude自偏好增强。

Conclusion: 感知到的模型身份会严重扭曲高级判断并微妙影响详细质量评分，强调需要盲评或多模型评估协议来确保LLM基准测试的公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet
their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and
cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions:
no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by
each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and
quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all
scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking
asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini"
label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels
frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in
preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.
Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's
self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity
can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality
ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to
ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: BED-LLM方法通过贝叶斯实验设计框架，让大语言模型能够智能地选择最大化信息增益的问题，在多轮对话中显著提升信息收集能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型作为多轮对话代理的能力，使其能够智能地、自适应地从用户或外部源收集信息

Method: 基于序列贝叶斯实验设计框架，迭代选择最大化期望信息增益的问题，使用基于LLM信念分布的概率模型，并设计了专门的EIG估计器和候选查询策略

Result: 在20个问题游戏和用户偏好推断测试中，相比直接提示和其他自适应策略，BED-LLM取得了显著的性能提升

Conclusion: BED-LLM为LLMs提供了一个原则性的框架，使其能够作为有效的多轮对话代理与外部环境交互，在信息收集任务中表现出色

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from
a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn
conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments.
Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large
Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that
maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given
the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a
principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief
distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its
construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific
innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely
relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a
targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM
achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on
the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,
compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

*Arash Ahmadi,Sarah Sharif,Yaser Banad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用强化学习和GRPO算法自动化HFACS分析航空事故人因素，小型专业模型性能超越大型模型，准确率提升350%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HFACS分析方法存在扩展性和一致性问题，需要自动化解决方案来提高航空安全分析效率

Method: 采用强化学习组相对策略优化(GRPO)算法微调Llama-3.1 8B模型，结合多组件奖励系统和合成数据生成技术

Result: 模型性能显著提升，准确匹配率从0.04提升到0.18(增长350%)，部分匹配率达0.88，超越GPT-5-mini和Gemini-2.5等独立模型

Conclusion: 小型领域优化模型能够提供更高效、更优秀的安全分析方案，适合在资源受限边缘设备上部署

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for
preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors
Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and
consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification
framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B
language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system
tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation
to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized
model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact
match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy
of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art
LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key
metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS
classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the
advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work
validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally
efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes
powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于像素的生成语言模型，通过将单词渲染为图像来替代基于文本的嵌入，解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型容易受到多语言字母表字符扰动攻击，导致性能显著下降，这主要源于子词分词器及其嵌入的词汇表外问题。

Method: 使用基于像素的表示方法，将单词渲染为单个图像，替代传统的文本嵌入方式，从而提供对噪声输入的更强鲁棒性，并扩展对多语言文本的兼容性。

Result: 在多语言LAMBADA数据集、WMT24数据集和SST-2基准测试中验证了该方法对拼写噪声的鲁棒性以及在多语言环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于像素的生成语言模型能够有效解决自回归语言模型对多语言字符攻击的脆弱性问题，同时保持多语言文本处理能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where
input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to
substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from
the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their
embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative
language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based
representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides
stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to
multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed
method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2
benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its
effectiveness in multilingual settings.

### [12] [Do Self-Supervised Speech Models Exhibit the Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21210)
*Yurie Koga,Shunsuke Kando,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨自监督语音模型是否表现出人类语言习得中的关键期效应，发现这些模型在音位习得方面没有明显的关键期效应证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键期效应指第二语言习得难度随接触时间延迟而增加，第一语言保持能力随接触时间延长而增强。先前研究主要基于文本语言模型，而语音模型中的关键期效应尚未充分探索，尽管口语在人类语言习得中具有核心作用。

Method: 使用儿童导向语音训练自监督语音模型，设置不同的第二语言训练开始时间和第一语言训练结束时间，评估模型的音位辨别性能。

Result: 自监督语音模型在音位习得方面没有表现出明显的关键期效应。延迟第二语言接触开始的模型在第二语言上表现更好，延迟第一语言接触结束会导致第一语言遗忘。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型与人类语言习得的关键期模式不同，表明当前模型架构可能无法完全复制人类语言发展的关键期特征。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether the Critical Period (CP) effects in human
language acquisition are observed in self-supervised speech models (S3Ms). CP
effects refer to greater difficulty in acquiring a second language (L2) with
delayed L2 exposure onset, and greater retention of their first language (L1)
with delayed L1 exposure offset. While previous work has studied these effects
using textual language models, their presence in speech models remains
underexplored despite the central role of spoken language in human language
acquisition. We train S3Ms with varying L2 training onsets and L1 training
offsets on child-directed speech and evaluate their phone discrimination
performance. We find that S3Ms do not exhibit clear evidence of either CP
effects in terms of phonological acquisition. Notably, models with delayed L2
exposure onset tend to perform better on L2 and delayed L1 exposure offset
leads to L1 forgetting.

Conclusion: DMP能有效提升多响应生成效率，可扩展到对齐和推理任务，与模型、数据集、解码策略和自一致性基线正交

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both
research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with
hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on
sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While
self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high
computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the
first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested
as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer
tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights,
we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation
through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the
model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP
consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds
promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC
performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their
development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key
challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are
addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's

*Alexandre Kabbach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过正态性概念重新审视图灵测试，认为图灵测试针对的是普通/平均人类智能而非卓越智能，需要机器像普通人一样犯错。同时指出图灵测试是统计测试，由陪审团而非单个法官判断。认为ChatGPT等大语言模型追求的是卓越智能而非普通智能，因此难以通过图灵测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视图灵测试的理论基础，探讨统计学意义上的"正态"概念如何帮助理解图灵测试的本质，以及现代AI系统（如大语言模型）与图灵测试原始构想之间的关系。

Method: 概念分析方法，通过统计学中的正态分布概念（既指规范意义上的平均，也指数学意义上的平均）来重新解读图灵测试的理论框架。

Result: 提出了两个核心观点：1）图灵测试针对的是普通人类智能，要求机器表现出普通人的不完美行为；2）图灵测试是统计测试，判断基于多个法官的聚合判断。认为大语言模型追求卓越智能而非普通智能，因此难以通过图灵测试。

Conclusion: 图灵测试是对普通智能的测试，由普通法官评估。大语言模型更接近"人工聪明"而非真正的人工智能。图灵测试能否促进对人类认知的理解，取决于人类心智是否可简化为普通/平均心智，这超出了图灵测试本身的范围，质疑了其所依赖的正态范式概念基础。

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of
normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the
normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense
of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two
ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather
than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test
requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior
just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a
statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a
single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As
such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his
original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical
abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of
multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of
normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average
judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,
it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the
Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than
normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it
proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per
se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can
contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether
the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which
largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual
underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Motivation: 探索自动文本摘要评估方法的可复现性挐战，解决文献中报告性能与实际实验结果之间的差异问题，提高评估方法的可靠性和透明度。

Method: 使用统一的开源评估框架，在SummEval数据集上对六种代表性指标（从经典的ROUGE到最新的LLM基于方法如G-Eval、SEval-Ex）进行实验对比分析。

Result: 发现了结构性的权衡：与人类判断对齐度最高的指标通常计算密集且在不同运行中不稳定。LLM评估方法存在随机性、技术依赖和可复现性有限等关键问题。

Conclusion: 建议采用更稳健的评估协议，包括详尽的文档记录和方法论标准化，以确保自动摘要评估的更高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text
summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six
representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent
LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies
between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our
experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to
the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of
evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the
highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and
less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key
concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness,
technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more
robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and
methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic
summarization assessment.

Conclusion: 提出三项可执行建议，并公开发布反事实数据集和评估框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential to accelerate and support
scholarly peer review and are increasingly used as fully automatic review
generators (ARGs). However, potential biases and systematic errors may pose
significant risks to scientific integrity; understanding the specific
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art ARGs is essential. We focus on
a core reviewing skill that underpins high-quality peer review: detecting
faulty research logic. This involves evaluating the internal consistency
between a paper's results, interpretations, and claims. We present a fully
automated counterfactual evaluation framework that isolates and tests this
skill under controlled conditions. Testing a range of ARG approaches, we find
that, contrary to expectation, flaws in research logic have no significant
effect on their output reviews. Based on our findings, we derive three
actionable recommendations for future work and release our counterfactual
dataset and evaluation framework publicly.

Motivation: 现有的医学大语言模型评估基准主要关注通用能力或模型作为求解器的表现，缺乏针对诊断准确性和临床相关性等关键维度的专业评估，医学奖励模型和评判器研究不足。

Method: 构建包含1026个专家标注案例的多模态数据集，采用三步严格流程确保数据质量，覆盖13个器官系统和8个临床科室，在6个临床维度上评估32个先进MLLM模型，并开发基线模型进行微调。

Conclusion: Med-RewardBench填补了医学奖励模型评估的空白，为医学MLLM的可靠评估提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在临床对齐方面的不足，并展示了微调的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in
medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and
professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges
critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges
remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical
requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or
evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like
diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce
Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and
judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset
spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026
expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality
evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and
medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs
with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate
substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义维度分析方法通常依赖预定义的粗粒度维度，忽略了更精细的概念区分，需要开发能够揭示语义组织更细致结构的新方法。

Method: 提出DCSRM模型，将大语言模型的词嵌入分解为多个子嵌入，每个编码特定语义信息；使用体素编码模型将这些子维度映射到大脑激活模式。

Result: 识别出一组可解释的语义子维度，发现语义维度按不同原则结构化，极性是驱动分解的关键因素；神经相关性验证了子维度的认知和神经科学合理性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了更细粒度的可解释语义子维度，有助于理解语言和大脑中意义组织的精细结构，为语义表示研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding the core dimensions of conceptual semantics is fundamental to
uncovering how meaning is organized in language and the brain. Existing
approaches often rely on predefined semantic dimensions that offer only broad
representations, overlooking finer conceptual distinctions. This paper proposes
a novel framework to investigate the subdimensions underlying coarse-grained
semantic dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a Disentangled Continuous
Semantic Representation Model (DCSRM) that decomposes word embeddings from
large language models into multiple sub-embeddings, each encoding specific
semantic information. Using these sub-embeddings, we identify a set of
interpretable semantic subdimensions. To assess their neural plausibility, we
apply voxel-wise encoding models to map these subdimensions to brain
activation. Our work offers more fine-grained interpretable semantic
subdimensions of conceptual meaning. Further analyses reveal that semantic
dimensions are structured according to distinct principles, with polarity
emerging as a key factor driving their decomposition into subdimensions. The
neural correlates of the identified subdimensions support their cognitive and
neuroscientific plausibility.

### [22] [Beyond the Surface: Probing the Ideological Depth of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21448)
*Shariar Kabir,Kevin Esterling,Yue Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出了"意识形态深度"的概念来衡量LLMs内部政治表征的稳健性和复杂性，通过可操纵性测试和稀疏自编码器分析发现，不同模型在意识形态深度上存在显著差异，深度模型具有更清晰的政治特征且干预效果更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型表现出明显的意识形态倾向，但这些倾向的稳定性和深度尚不清楚。表面层面的回应容易被提示工程操纵，需要探究LLMs是否具有连贯的底层意识形态。

Method: 采用双重方法：1) 通过指令提示和激活引导测量开源LLMs的可操纵性；2) 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)探测模型内部机制，分析意识形态特征的分布和抽象程度。

Result: 发现不同模型的可操纵性差异显著，一些模型能轻松切换自由和保守观点，而其他模型表现出抵抗或拒绝率增加。深度模型包含7.3倍多的政治特征，针对性消融核心政治特征会导致相关主题推理的一致逻辑转变。

Conclusion: 意识形态深度是LLMs的可量化属性，可操纵性为理解其潜在政治架构提供了有价值的窗口，深度模型具有更稳定和复杂的内在意识形态表征。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated pronounced ideological
leanings, yet the stability and depth of these positions remain poorly
understood. Surface-level responses can often be manipulated through simple
prompt engineering, calling into question whether they reflect a coherent
underlying ideology. This paper investigates the concept of "ideological depth"
in LLMs, defined as the robustness and complexity of their internal political
representations. We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the
"steerability" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting
and activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch
between liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an
increased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.
Second, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower
steerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our
evaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than
another model of similar size. This allows targeted ablation of a core
political feature in an ideologically "deep" model, leading to consistent,
logical shifts in its reasoning across related topics, whereas the same
intervention in a "shallow" model results in an increase in refusal outputs.
Our findings suggest that ideological depth is a quantifiable property of LLMs
and that steerability serves as a valuable window into their latent political
architecture.

Motivation: 大型语言模型计算需求大难以广泛使用，而小语言模型的现有方法如SFT缺乏新颖性，RLHF成本高昂，需要更有效的创意写作增强方案

Method: 采用RLAIF框架，探索两种AI奖励策略：1) 基于多智能体拒绝采样框架训练的奖励模型；2) 通过对抗训练优化的原则引导LLM-as-a-Judge直接提供奖励信号

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了创意输出，但原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法在生成质量、训练效率和减少人工标注依赖方面表现更优，自动化评估与人工判断高度一致

Conclusion: 原则引导的LLM-as-a-Judge方法为创意小语言模型提供了更可扩展和有效的路径，减少了对人类标注数据的依赖

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing
capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread
use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but
current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper
explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a
7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first
strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a
novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The
second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose
reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a
reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive
experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative
output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields
superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in
training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting
a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated
evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments. Our code

Conclusion: 该方法通过优先考虑多样性并结合性能评估，能够有效选择多样化的分类器构建集成系统，提升假新闻检测的准确性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals
particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media,
leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and
politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied
to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly
effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However,
their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent
classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge,
especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we
propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes
diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise
diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize
them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then
explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level,
each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is
identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection
process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's
performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct
experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from
different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method
is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results
show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过数据和模型的动态人机协同进化，为可持续的LLM训练建立了新范式

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely
on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two
common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face
limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed
dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and
context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off
filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop
optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively
identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns
(complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores
(quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal
samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic
integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model
capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of
seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on
average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a
new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution
of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

TL;DR: 研究发现不同性格类型的用户对GPT-4和Claude 3.5有显著不同偏好，理性类型偏向GPT-4，理想主义者偏向Claude 3.5


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解不同性格特质的用户在多轮协作中是否会系统地偏好某些大语言模型

Method: 将32名参与者按Keirsey性格类型均匀分组，评估他们与GPT-4和Claude 3.5在四个协作任务中的交互：数据分析、创意写作、信息检索和写作辅助

Result: 理性类型强烈偏好GPT-4（尤其是目标导向任务），理想主义者偏好Claude 3.5（尤其是创造性和分析性任务），其他性格类型显示任务依赖性偏好

Conclusion: 性格基础的分析能够揭示传统评估方法没有发现的大语言模型差异

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into everyday
workflows, where users shape outcomes through multi-turn collaboration, a
critical question emerges: do users with different personality traits
systematically prefer certain LLMs over others? We conducted a study with 32
participants evenly distributed across four Keirsey personality types,
evaluating their interactions with GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 across four
collaborative tasks: data analysis, creative writing, information retrieval,
and writing assistance. Results revealed significant personality-driven
preferences: Rationals strongly preferred GPT-4, particularly for goal-oriented
tasks, while idealists favored Claude 3.5, especially for creative and
analytical tasks. Other personality types showed task-dependent preferences.
Sentiment analysis of qualitative feedback confirmed these patterns. Notably,
aggregate helpfulness ratings were similar across models, showing how
personality-based analysis reveals LLM differences that traditional evaluations
miss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个具有卓越文本表示能力的通用上下文文本嵌入模型，通过高质量多样化数据提升检索模型性能。

Method: 使用统一的多任务框架，包括专门的数据转换和训练策略。采用数据合成流水线（包括转述、增强和硬负例生成）和两阶段训练策略（检索预训练+全任务微调）。

Conclusion: 高质量、多样化的数据对提升检索模型性能至关重要，利用LLM生成能力可以进一步优化数据质量，实现嵌入模型的突破。

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model
with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task
framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies.
The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse
textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance
model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging
LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard
negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample
difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training
strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by
full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities
based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards
(August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on
tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that
higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model
performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further
optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are
released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we
provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出了Misviz基准数据集，包含2604个真实世界可视化图表和12种误导类型标注，以及Misviz-synth合成数据集（81,814个图表），用于检测误导性可视化图表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误导性可视化图表是社交媒体和网络上错误信息的重要来源，违反图表设计原则会扭曲数据并导致读者得出错误结论。现有AI模型训练和评估缺乏大型、多样化的开放数据集。

Method: 构建真实世界可视化数据集Misviz（2,604个图表）和合成数据集Misviz-synth（81,814个图表），使用最先进的多模态大语言模型、基于规则的系统以及微调分类器进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示检测误导性可视化图表仍然是一个极具挑战性的任务，即使使用最先进的模型也难以准确识别。

Conclusion: 发布了Misviz和Misviz-synth数据集及相关代码，为检测误导性可视化图表提供了重要的基准资源，但该任务仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Misleading visualizations are a potent driver of misinformation on social
media and the web. By violating chart design principles, they distort data and
lead readers to draw inaccurate conclusions. Prior work has shown that both
humans and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are frequently deceived by
such visualizations. Automatically detecting misleading visualizations and
identifying the specific design rules they violate could help protect readers
and reduce the spread of misinformation. However, the training and evaluation
of AI models has been limited by the absence of large, diverse, and openly
available datasets. In this work, we introduce Misviz, a benchmark of 2,604
real-world visualizations annotated with 12 types of misleaders. To support
model training, we also release Misviz-synth, a synthetic dataset of 81,814
visualizations generated using Matplotlib and based on real-world data tables.
We perform a comprehensive evaluation on both datasets using state-of-the-art
MLLMs, rule-based systems, and fine-tuned classifiers. Our results reveal that
the task remains highly challenging. We release Misviz, Misviz-synth, and the
accompanying code.

TL;DR: 提出CPI-FT框架解决多任务微调中的跷跷板现象，通过核心参数隔离和融合技术减少任务干扰和遗忘


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)中参数更新往往导致某些任务进步而其他任务退步的跷跷板现象，需要解决多任务间的干扰问题

Method: 首先独立微调每个任务识别核心参数区域，按区域重叠分组任务，通过参数移植和SLERP融合技术整合参数，最后使用混合任务数据进行轻量级流水线训练

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著减轻任务干扰和遗忘，持续优于传统的多任务和多阶段微调基线

Conclusion: CPI-FT框架通过核心参数隔离和智能融合有效解决了多任务微调中的跷跷板问题，为LLM的下游任务适配提供了新思路

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a pivotal approach to adapting large language
models (LLMs) for downstream tasks; however, performance often suffers from the
``seesaw phenomenon'', where indiscriminate parameter updates yield progress on
certain tasks at the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel \emph{Core Parameter Isolation Fine-Tuning} (CPI-FT) framework.
Specifically, we first independently fine-tune the LLM on each task to identify
its core parameter regions by quantifying parameter update magnitudes. Tasks
with similar core regions are then grouped based on region overlap, forming
clusters for joint modeling. We further introduce a parameter fusion technique:
for each task, core parameters from its individually fine-tuned model are
directly transplanted into a unified backbone, while non-core parameters from
different tasks are smoothly integrated via Spherical Linear Interpolation
(SLERP), mitigating destructive interference. A lightweight, pipelined SFT
training phase using mixed-task data is subsequently employed, while freezing
core regions from prior tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly alleviates task interference and forgetting, consistently
outperforming vanilla multi-task and multi-stage fine-tuning baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理需要深度文本分析的推理密集型回归任务（如基于量规的评分、领域特定检索）时表现不佳，特别是在有限任务特定训练数据和计算资源的情况下。

Method: 提出MENTAT方法，结合批量反射提示优化和神经集成学习，通过优化提示策略和集成多个模型预测来提升推理性能。

Result: MENTAT方法相比冻结LLM提示和Transformer编码器微调基线，取得了高达65%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MENTAT为推理密集型回归任务提供了有效的解决方案，但该领域仍有很大的改进空间，需要未来的进一步研究。

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models
(LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing
subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression
tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc
problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much
deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training
data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR
tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis
that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient
descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and
lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with
neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both
baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Motivation: 解决推理任务中缺乏真实答案时如何设计评分函数来识别正确推理链的关键挑战

Method: 使用推理和最终答案的联合对数似然来评分候选生成，该方法自然分解为推理置信度和答案置信度

Result: 在MATH500上提升10.18分，在AIME2025上提升9.81分，在20次比较中16次以至少2倍少的样本超越基线

Conclusion: 正确推理链展现出显著更高的推理和答案置信度，证明了PiCSAR方法的有效性

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and
large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and
selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning
tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning
chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic
Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that
scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the
reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final
answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence.
PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500,
+9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in
16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains
exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the
effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Method: 使用1,512张全景X射线图像数据集，评估三种方法：定制CNN、CNN特征提取与传统分类器混合模型、微调预训练架构，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 混合CNN随机森林模型准确率最高（85.4%），优于定制CNN基线（74.3%）；预训练模型中VGG16表现最好（82.3%）

Conclusion: CNN特征提取与集成分类器结合是自动化牙科诊断支持的有效途径，但需要更大数据集和进一步临床验证

Abstract: This study investigates deep learning methods for automated classification of
dental conditions in panoramic X-ray images. A dataset of 1,512 radiographs
with 11,137 expert-verified annotations across four conditions fillings,
cavities, implants, and impacted teeth was used. After preprocessing and class
balancing, three approaches were evaluated: a custom convolutional neural
network (CNN), hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional
classifiers, and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures. Experiments employed 5
fold cross validation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as
evaluation metrics. The hybrid CNN Random Forest model achieved the highest
performance with 85.4% accuracy, surpassing the custom CNN baseline of 74.3%.
Among pre-trained models, VGG16 performed best at 82.3% accuracy, followed by
Xception and ResNet50. Results show that hybrid models improve discrimination
of morphologically similar conditions and provide efficient, reliable
performance. These findings suggest that combining CNN-based feature extraction
with ensemble classifiers offers a practical path toward automated dental
diagnostic support, while also highlighting the need for larger datasets and
further clinical validation.

Motivation: 大规模图像生成模型在零样本外观迁移中存在注意力泄漏问题，这是由于Query-Key对齐导致的语义映射不准确

Method: 提出Q-Align方法，包含三个核心贡献：Query-Query对齐实现精细空间语义映射、Key-Value重排增强特征对应、使用重排后的键值进行注意力精化

Result: 通过大量实验验证，Q-Align在外观保真度方面优于最先进方法，同时保持竞争力的结构保持能力

Conclusion: Q-Align有效解决了注意力泄漏问题，为零样本外观迁移提供了更准确的语义对齐方案

Abstract: We observe that zero-shot appearance transfer with large-scale image
generation models faces a significant challenge: Attention Leakage. This
challenge arises when the semantic mapping between two images is captured by
the Query-Key alignment. To tackle this issue, we introduce Q-Align, utilizing
Query-Query alignment to mitigate attention leakage and improve the semantic
alignment in zero-shot appearance transfer. Q-Align incorporates three core
contributions: (1) Query-Query alignment, facilitating the sophisticated
spatial semantic mapping between two images; (2) Key-Value rearrangement,
enhancing feature correspondence through realignment; and (3) Attention
refinement using rearranged keys and values to maintain semantic consistency.
We validate the effectiveness of Q-Align through extensive experiments and
analysis, and Q-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance
fidelity while maintaining competitive structure preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型由于迭代推理过程导致计算开销大，简单的特征缓存会导致质量下降，需要解决缓存引起的累积误差问题

Method: 提出ERTACache框架：离线残差分析识别可重用步骤、轨迹感知校正系数动态调整积分区间、闭式残差线性化模型近似缓存误差

Result: 在标准图像和视频生成基准测试中实现2倍推理加速，视觉质量保持甚至提升，Wan2.1视频扩散模型上加速2倍且VBench退化最小

Conclusion: ERTACache通过联合校正特征偏移误差和步长放大误差，实现了高效准确的采样，显著提升扩散模型推理效率

Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their
inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a
promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across
timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this
work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and
decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by
inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from
error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we
propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both
error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify
reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a
trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates
cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.
Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under
aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video
generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup
while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the
state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x
acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline
fidelity while significantly improving efficiency. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该文章提出了时间视觉筛选(TVS)方法，通过保留关键视频段落和重构查询，解决视频大语言模型在细粒度时间语义理解上的挑战，在训练和推理阶段都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型因为帧样本稀疏和帧间推理监督不充分，无法抓取细粒度的时间语义，而人类自然具有通过拖动进度条来筛选关键时间段落的能力。

Method: 受认知科学启发，提出时间视觉筛选(TVS)任务：(1)保留关键视频段落，(2)同步重构查询为最直接形式保持答案一致性，(3)保持答案的不变性和一致性。TVS作为模块化前端适配器集成到训练和推理流程中。

Result: 构建了首个TVS标准数据集，提出的ReSimplifyIt基线在视频剪辑任务上比之前方法提升0.47的F-1分数，查询重写性能也具有竞争力。实验显示TVS在训练阶段获得7.33%提升，推理阶段获得34.6%提升。

Conclusion: TVS通过优化推理负担和认知负荷分配，在训练时对齐查询与关键视觉信息，在推理时支持查询感知的段落聚焦和流程化查询表征，证明了时间信息筛选对改善视频-语言理解的有效性。

Abstract: Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and
focusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse
frame sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their
training. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science
principles, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that
universally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data
by: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously
reconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer
consistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible
answer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be
seamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video
Question Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of
reasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with
focus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment
focus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first
benchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior
approaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming
while achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments
demonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)
and 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information
screening for improving video-language understanding.

Abstract: Localisation of surgical tools constitutes a foundational building block for
computer-assisted interventional technologies. Works in this field typically
focus on training deep learning models to perform segmentation tasks.
Performance of learning-based approaches is limited by the availability of
diverse annotated data. We argue that skeletal pose annotations are a more
efficient annotation approach for surgical tools, striking a balance between
richness of semantic information and ease of annotation, thus allowing for
accelerated growth of available annotated data. To encourage adoption of this
annotation style, we present, ROBUST-MIPS, a combined tool pose and tool
instance segmentation dataset derived from the existing ROBUST-MIS dataset. Our
enriched dataset facilitates the joint study of these two annotation styles and
allow head-to-head comparison on various downstream tasks. To demonstrate the
adequacy of pose annotations for surgical tool localisation, we set up a simple
benchmark using popular pose estimation methods and observe high-quality
results. To ease adoption, together with the dataset, we release our benchmark
models and custom tool pose annotation software.

whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under
distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address
these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play
safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.
Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects
safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a
patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches
to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a
single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability,
making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture.
We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models.
Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe
content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative
architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of
benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including
both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all
baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the
probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20%
for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial
attacks.

TL;DR: GENNAV是一个用于从自然语言指令和前置摄像头图像中识别目标区域位置的系统，特别擅长处理边界模糊的stuff-type目标区域，并在多目标和无目标场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理stuff-type目标区域（边界模糊）以及无目标或多目标场景时表现不佳，需要一种能够同时预测目标存在性和生成分割掩码的解决方案。

Method: 提出GENNAV系统，能够预测目标存在性并为多个stuff-type目标区域生成分割掩码。构建了GRiN-Drive基准数据集，包含无目标、单目标和多目标三种样本类型。

Conclusion: GENNAV成功解决了stuff-type目标区域识别难题，在复杂真实世界环境中表现出色，为移动设备的视觉导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the task of identifying the location of target regions from a
natural language instruction and a front camera image captured by a mobility.
This task is challenging because it requires both existence prediction and
segmentation, particularly for stuff-type target regions with ambiguous
boundaries. Existing methods often underperform in handling stuff-type target
regions, in addition to absent or multiple targets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GENNAV, which predicts target existence and generates
segmentation masks for multiple stuff-type target regions. To evaluate GENNAV,
we constructed a novel benchmark called GRiN-Drive, which includes three
distinct types of samples: no-target, single-target, and multi-target. GENNAV
achieved superior performance over baseline methods on standard evaluation
metrics. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments with four automobiles
operated in five geographically distinct urban areas to validate its zero-shot
transfer performance. In these experiments, GENNAV outperformed baseline
methods and demonstrated its robustness across diverse real-world environments.

TL;DR: R-4B是一个自适应思考的多模态大语言模型，能够根据问题复杂度自动决定是否启用思考过程，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂推理问题上表现优异，但对于简单问题，逐步思考过程是冗余的，造成了计算效率低下。

Method: 采用双模式退火训练，结合双模式策略优化(BPO)，让模型同时具备思考和非思考两种能力，并通过改进的GRPO框架进行训练。

Result: 在25个挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，在大多数任务上超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在推理密集型基准上与更大模型性能相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: R-4B通过自适应思考机制有效平衡了模型性能和计算效率，为多模态大语言模型的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking
capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning
problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems
solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose
R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on
problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both
thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply
Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in
determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first
train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which
contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a
second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy
model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query.
Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance
across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks
and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as
Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB检测方法在遮挡、伪装和光照变化等恶劣条件下性能受限，需要更鲁棒的模态无关方法来解决隐蔽物体检测的挑战。

Method: 提出Mamba-based融合机制，整合RGB、热成像和深度三种模态数据，识别模态特定特征并在统一表示中进行融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，证明了融合设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的融合架构能显著推进多模态目标检测领域发展，特别是在视觉退化或复杂条件下，同时暴露了当前单模态和简单融合策略的关键局限性。

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental
challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage,
and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based
detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need
for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present
HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data
using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals
across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged
targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific
features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well
across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple
benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance
compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our
fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion
strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion
architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object
detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Conclusion: RadGS-Reg通过联合3D重建和配准，有效解决了CT/X射线配准中的关键挑战，为图像引导导航提供了高精度和实时性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation
remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and
real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on
iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and
domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and
shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by
dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these
limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level
CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS)
reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays
vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS
reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism,
focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific
pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real
data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments
on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both
tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at:

Method: 创建包含620万个合成3D住宅建筑的多模态数据集，每个建筑通过三种模态表示：LoD 4语义增强3D线框图、对应平面图图像和LiDAR式屋顶点云。语义标注从平面图图像中推导而来。

Abstract: 3D building models are critical for applications in architecture, energy
simulation, and navigation. Yet, generating accurate and semantically rich 3D
buildings automatically remains a major challenge due to the lack of
large-scale annotated datasets in the public domain. Inspired by the success of
synthetic data in computer vision, we introduce SYNBUILD-3D, a large, diverse,
and multi-modal dataset of over 6.2 million synthetic 3D residential buildings
at Level of Detail (LoD) 4. In the dataset, each building is represented
through three distinct modalities: a semantically enriched 3D wireframe graph
at LoD 4 (Modality I), the corresponding floor plan images (Modality II), and a
LiDAR-like roof point cloud (Modality III). The semantic annotations for each
building wireframe are derived from the corresponding floor plan images and
include information on rooms, doors, and windows. Through its tri-modal nature,
future work can use SYNBUILD-3D to develop novel generative AI algorithms that
automate the creation of 3D building models at LoD 4, subject to predefined
floor plan layouts and roof geometries, while enforcing semantic-geometric
consistency. Dataset and code samples are publicly available at

Abstract: Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in
geometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is
consequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When
working with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions
caused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography
and the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial
distortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When
considering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are
three conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)
distortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and
(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been
addressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and
unified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed
approach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal
solvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed
solvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining
similar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks
including images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers
will be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.

*Zhenghao He,Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了全局概念激活向量（GCAV）框架，通过对比学习和注意力融合机制统一不同层的CAV表示，解决跨层概念不一致性问题，提高概念归因的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV在不同层独立计算时存在概念表示不一致的问题，导致跨层比较不可靠，需要一种统一的概念表示方法来提高解释性。

Method: 使用对比学习对齐不同层的概念表示，采用基于注意力的融合机制构建全局集成的CAV，并提出了TGCAV方法来应用TCAV到GCAV表示。

Result: 实验表明GCAV显著降低了TCAV分数的方差，保持了概念相关性，有效缓解了跨层概念不一致性，增强了概念定位能力，并提高了对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GCAV通过整合跨层信息提供了一个更全面、可解释的深度学习模型概念编码理解框架，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) provide a powerful approach for
interpreting deep neural networks by quantifying their sensitivity to
human-defined concepts. However, when computed independently at different
layers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons
unreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation
Vector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically
consistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align
concept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion
mechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method
significantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept
relevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate
the effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation
Vectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We
conduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating
that our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,
enhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial
perturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent
framework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable
understanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VICP是一个新颖的视觉上下文提示框架，通过在上下文中使用示例作为提示，使模型能够直接泛化到未见过的物体类别，无需参数调整或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物体重识别方法需要为每个新类别训练专门的模型，缺乏泛化能力且需要大量标注数据。自监督学习虽然减少了标注需求，但难以捕捉对重识别至关重要的身份敏感特征。

Method: 结合大语言模型和视觉基础模型：LLM通过任务特定提示从少量正负样本对中推断语义身份规则，然后指导VFM（如DINO）通过动态视觉提示提取身份判别性特征。

Result: 在ShopID10K数据集和多个重识别基准测试中，VICP在未见类别上的表现明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VICP通过将LLM衍生的语义概念与VFM的预训练先验对齐，实现了对新类别的泛化，消除了数据集特定重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models
(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly
labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces
annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture
\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes
Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on
seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only
\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter
adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer
semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through
task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract
ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning
LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables
generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific
retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K
object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and
cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks
demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen
categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

Motivation: 精确地描述腳脾肿瘤对于诊断、治疗规划和结果评估至关重要，但由于解剖学变异性和数据集有限，自动分割仍面临挑战。

Method: 使用SegResNet模型（Auto3DSeg架构的一部分），在两个MRI腳脾肿瘤分割任务上进行5折交叉验证和STAPLE集成。重点关注解剖相关的关键区域。任务1使用91例T1加权动脉期对比增强MRI，任务2使用50例T2加权MR-Linac数据。

Conclusion: 结果显示了在小数据集下MRI腳脾肿瘤分割的挑战性，以及不同MRI序列导致的性能变化。虽然性能中等，但显示了自动分割的潜力，并强调需要更大、标准化的MRI数据集来提高模型稳健性和临床应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,
treatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains
challenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In
this study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were
trained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as
part of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold
cross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically
relevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic
MRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor
Segmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases
with expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated
segmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean
Average Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,
the algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD
of 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC
of 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203
mm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor
segmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by
different MRI sequences. Despite modest performance, the results demonstrate
potential for automated delineation and emphasize the need for larger,
standardized MRI datasets to improve model robustness and clinical utility.

Conclusion: Reverse Imaging通过物理驱动的数据增强方法，从根本上解决了心脏MRI分割的泛化问题，实现了宽谱泛化能力

Abstract: Pretrained segmentation models for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
struggle to generalize across different imaging sequences due to significant
variations in image contrast. These variations arise from changes in imaging
protocols, yet the same fundamental spin properties, including proton density,
T1, and T2 values, govern all acquired images. With this core principle, we
introduce Reverse Imaging, a novel physics-driven method for cardiac MRI data
augmentation and domain adaptation to fundamentally solve the generalization
problem. Our method reversely infers the underlying spin properties from
observed cardiac MRI images, by solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems
regularized by the prior distribution of spin properties. We acquire this "spin
prior" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric
SAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which
offers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but
meaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an
interpretable "latent variable" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of
arbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate
segmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,
realizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.

Motivation: 传统HMR方法为通用性优化但忽略了用户特定体型，过度依赖2D约束会损害3D精度，需要同时考虑个性化体型和3D姿态合理性。

Method: 首先校准用户体型，然后基于该体型进行个性化姿态拟合，使用点扩散变换器实现体型条件化的3D姿态先验，通过点蒸馏采样损失迭代指导姿态拟合。

Conclusion: PHD通过解耦体型校准和姿态拟合过程，有效解决了传统方法过度依赖2D约束的问题，为个性化3D人体重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery
(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to
improve pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are
designed to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these
methods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to
improve alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly
account for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In
contrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's
body shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned
on that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose
prior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides
the pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose
prior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D
constraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose
accuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often
overlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,
requiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile
plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose
estimators to enhance their performance. Project page:

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating
high-fidelity 3D human poses, yet their iterative nature and multi-hypothesis
requirements incur substantial computational cost. In this paper, we propose an
Efficient Diffusion-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation framework with a
Hierarchical Temporal Pruning (HTP) strategy, which dynamically prunes
redundant pose tokens across both frame and semantic levels while preserving
critical motion dynamics. HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)
Temporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by
analyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph
construction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the
resulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on
motion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs
fine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most
informative pose tokens. Experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that
HTP reduces training MACs by 38.5\%, inference MACs by 56.8\%, and improves
inference speed by an average of 81.1\% compared to prior diffusion-based
methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of
high-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface
structures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and
time-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of
large-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of
advanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address
this critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework
for generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D
fingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D
style transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale
images mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D
Structure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D
anatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that
renders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other
imaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale
synthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the
high quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition
performance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and
fine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable
reduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD
benchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data
scarcity.

Abstract: Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is
performed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and
handling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of
surgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the
possibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous
post-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and
education. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,
as it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously
time-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated
computer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.
Since most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in
the medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the
Gynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset
containing region-based annotations of a common medical condition named
endometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue. The dataset is the
first of its kind and it has been created in collaboration with leading medical
experts in the field.

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用区域全卷积网络对腹腔镜妇科手术视频中的手术器械进行实例分割和识别，实现了较高的器械定位和分割精度，但器械类型识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频记录已成为医学内窥镜领域的重要信息来源，但自动内容索引（基于内容的医学视频档案搜索基础）仍然是一个巨大挑战，因为视频内容非常特殊。

Method: 使用区域全卷积网络进行实例感知的(1)器械分割和(2)器械识别。第一部分处理二值实例分割（区分器械或背景），第二部分研究多类别器械识别（识别器械类型）。

Result: 即使训练样本数量适中，也能以相当高的精度定位和分割器械区域。但确定具体器械类型仍然非常具有挑战性，因为手术器械内在相似度高。

Conclusion: 该方法在手术器械分割方面表现良好，但在器械类型识别方面仍需改进，主要受限于手术器械之间的高度相似性。

Abstract: Recorded videos from surgeries have become an increasingly important
information source for the field of medical endoscopy, since the recorded
footage shows every single detail of the surgery. However, while video
recording is straightforward these days, automatic content indexing - the basis
for content-based search in a medical video archive - is still a great
challenge due to the very special video content. In this work, we investigate
segmentation and recognition of surgical instruments in videos recorded from
laparoscopic gynecology. More precisely, we evaluate the achievable performance
of segmenting surgical instruments from their background by using a
region-based fully convolutional network for instance-aware (1) instrument
segmentation as well as (2) instrument recognition. While the first part
addresses only binary segmentation of instances (i.e., distinguishing between
instrument or background) we also investigate multi-class instrument
recognition (i.e., identifying the type of instrument). Our evaluation results
show that even with a moderately low number of training examples, we are able
to localize and segment instrument regions with a pretty high accuracy.
However, the results also reveal that determining the particular instrument is
still very challenging, due to the inherently high similarity of surgical
instruments.

TL;DR: 提出一种用于生物全手片图像(WSI)的索引地图标准框架，通过三层组织结构提供细粒度的组织类型和病理变化信息，解决大规模WSI集合中手动检查的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目前缺乏标准化的WSI元数据标准，在构建AI算法训练或验证集时，需要通过手动检查来确定WSI内容，这对包含数百万对象的大规模集合而言效率低下。

Method: 提出一种通用框架来生成WSI的2D索引地图，并为特定应用领域提供配置机制。该方法在临床病理学领域进行实践，使用共享语法和语义实现不同目录之间的互操性。每个WSI集合装备详细的组织地图，分为源、组织类型和病理变化三个层次，每个层次都将WSI的区域分配给特定类别。

Result: 通过在WSI目录、机器学习和基于图的WSI表示中的具体例子，展示了所提出标准的优势和适用性。该方法能够提供细粒度的WSI内容信息，支持大规模集合的自动化处理。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的标准化框架有效解决了WSI集合中缺乏统一元数据的问题，为AI算法开发提供了高效的数据选择和处理机制，在多个医学领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A Whole Slide Image (WSI) is a high-resolution digital image created by
scanning an entire glass slide containing a biological specimen, such as tissue
sections or cell samples, at multiple magnifications. These images can be
viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial
Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,
including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.
They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,
microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic
science.
  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it
is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently
no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through
manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several
million objects.
  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a
profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this
approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics
to achieve interoperability between different catalogs.
  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that
provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is
organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,
with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.
  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard
through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and
graph-based WSI representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于置信度伪标签的无监督增量学习方法ICPL，能够在无标注数据集上进行增量学习，性能接近有监督方法，在最终准确率上比最先进的class-iNCD方法高出5%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中经常出现训练时未见的新类别，需要模型能够增量学习新知识。现有的类增量学习方法假设增量数据集完全标注，这在实践中不现实。

Method: 使用基于置信度的伪标签替代人工标注，将伪标签集成到各种CIL方法中，通过置信度选择机制进行无监督增量学习。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ImageNet100上评估性能下降，相比有监督方法取得竞争性结果，比最先进的class-iNCD方法准确率高出5%以上，在细粒度数据集上验证了实用性，计算复杂度适合资源受限环境。

Conclusion: ICPL方法有效解决了无标注数据下的增量学习问题，性能优异且实用性强，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many
computer vision tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, novel classes that
were unseen during training often emerge, requiring models to acquire new
knowledge incrementally. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) methods enable a
model to learn novel classes while retaining knowledge of previous classes.
However, these methods make the strong assumption that the incremental dataset
is fully labeled, which is unrealistic in practice. In this work, we propose an
unsupervised Incremental Learning method using Confidence-based Pseudo-labels
(ICPL), which replaces human annotations with pseudo-labels, enabling
incremental learning from unlabeled datasets. We integrate these pseudo-labels
into various CIL methods with confidence-based selection and evaluate
performance degradation on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100. Then, we compare our
approach to popular Class Incremental Novel Category Discovery (class-iNCD)
methods addressing similar challenges. Additionally, we apply our method to
fine-grained datasets to demonstrate its real-world practicality and measure
its computational complexity to validate its suitability for
resource-constrained environments. ICPL achieves competitive results compared
to supervised methods and outperforms state-of-the-art class-iNCD methods by
more than 5% in final accuracy.

Motivation: 合成医学数据虽然可以大规模训练模型，但与真实临床环境存在显著域间差异，限制了模型的渗透性。论文重点解决合成与真实头部X光片在衰减行为、噪声特征和软组织表现方面的差异。

Method: 提出MedShift模型，基于Flow Matching和Schrodinger Bridges技术，学习一个共享的域无关潜在空间，支持在训练过的任意域之间进行无对应图像转换。这种方法无需域特定训练或配对数据。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然MedShift模型尺寸比液体模型更小，但具有强大性能和灵活性。模型可以在推理时调整以优先考虑感知保真性或结构一致性。还发布了X-DigiSkull数据集，包含对齐的合成和真实头颅X光片。

Conclusion: MedShift为医学形象领域的域适配提供了一种可扩展、通用性强的解决方案，能够有效缩小合成与真实医学数据之间的域间差距，提高模型在真实临床环境中的性能。

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,
but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical
settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation
between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging
discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue
representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative
model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables
high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior
approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,
MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless
translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce
X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays
under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared
to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains
flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual
fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable
solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are

Abstract: Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in
ecosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,
large-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate
modelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or
canopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In
this study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual
trees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree
crowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown
centers and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on
billions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling
the model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We
compare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with
state-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial
lidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how
detection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels. Our
method offers a scalable framework for global, high-resolution tree monitoring,
and is adaptable to future satellite missions offering improved imagery.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态场景的实时高保真渲染提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案，在训练效率和渲染质量方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key
requirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to
dynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense
Gaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper
presents \M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient
training in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically
organized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians
represent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level
Gaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively
activated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational
overhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models
motion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian
spawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional
adaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static
regions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that \M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly
reducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 模型在单句和详细描述任务上表现与大型多模态通用模型相当，新框架有效提升了描述质量。

Conclusion: 轻量级专家模型可作为设备端应用的强大视觉专家，Sharp-Eyed Refinement框架成功缓解了视觉盲点问题。

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction
systems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is
challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by
implementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times
smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence
and detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve
performance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its
potential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.
While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it
suffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning
errors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,
where we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms
and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel
captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality
through improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed
visual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified
during the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our
specialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the
effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs) offer strong potential for AI-based dementia
diagnosis, their integration into federated learning (FL) systems remains
underexplored. In this benchmarking study, we systematically evaluate the
impact of key design choices: classification head architecture, fine-tuning
strategy, and aggregation method, on the performance and efficiency of
federated FM tuning using brain MRI data. Using a large multi-cohort dataset,
we find that the architecture of the classification head substantially
influences performance, freezing the FM encoder achieves comparable results to
full fine-tuning, and advanced aggregation methods outperform standard
federated averaging. Our results offer practical insights for deploying FMs in
decentralized clinical settings and highlight trade-offs that should guide

TL;DR: 提出Multi-Method Ensemble (MME)评分方法，通过结合特征截断和多种评分函数来提升OOD检测性能，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法通常只关注单一技术（特征截断或评分函数）或在特定类型OOD数据集上评估，忽略了组合多种现有解决方案的潜力。

Method: 提出MME评分方法，统一结合最先进的特征截断技术和多个评分函数，通过集成方法增强对不同类型OOD样本的鲁棒性。

Result: 在大型和小型基准测试（包括近OOD和远OOD场景）上，MME显著优于现有方法。使用BiT模型在ImageNet-1K基准上达到27.57%的平均FPR95，比最佳基线提升6%。

Conclusion: 理论和实证表明，最先进的特征截断和评分函数可以有效结合，多方法集成能显著提升OOD检测性能，MME方法在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks
operating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.
Existing methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:
feature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)
and OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish
between ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single
family of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD
dataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.
Motivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate
that state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be
effectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring
functions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on
these insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies
state-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.
Extensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering
near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,
our method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K
benchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.

Result: 在HRSC2016数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提高了对抗补丁攻击的成功率并增强了其迁移性

Conclusion: 局部增强方法通过减少背景干扰，能够更有效地提升对抗补丁攻击的效果和迁移能力

Abstract: Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily
rely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to
misclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can
improve the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive
augmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce
unnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection
model. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but
rather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper
proposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the
target regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing
background interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more
directly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby
improving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success
rate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.

Motivation: 现有的视频多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但仍容易产生与视频内容不一致或无关的幻觉。之前的基准主要关注短视频，将幻觉归因于语言先验、缺失帧或视觉编码器引入的偏差，但这些原因过于简化。特别是在长视频中，语义聚合过程中的幻觉问题变得更加关键。

Method: 1) 引入首个长视频幻觉基准ELV-Halluc；2) 系统研究语义聚合幻觉(SAH)；3) 实验验证SAH存在且随语义复杂度增加；4) 分析模型在快速变化语义上的SAH倾向；5) 采用位置编码策略和DPO策略来缓解SAH；6) 构建包含8K对抗数据对的数据集

Result: 1) 确认了SAH的存在及其与语义复杂度的正相关关系；2) 发现模型在快速变化语义时更容易产生SAH；3) 位置编码策略有助于缓解SAH；4) DPO策略增强了模型区分事件内和跨事件语义的能力；5) 在ELV-Halluc和Video-MME基准上均取得改进，SAH比例大幅降低27.7%

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了长视频中的语义聚合幻觉问题，提出了专门的基准和有效的缓解策略。结果表明通过适当的位置编码和DPO训练，可以显著减少模型在复杂语义场景下的幻觉现象，为提升视频多模态大语言模型的可靠性提供了重要见解和方法。

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to
hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.
Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They
attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing
frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these
causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still
oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect
outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of
hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during
the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic
groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to
increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to
separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.
To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark
dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of
SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases
with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to
SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to
mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to
alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability
to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a
dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both
ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种卷积神经网络上采样器，将低分辨率的基础模型特征与输入图像结合进行上采样，用于高效处理显微镜图像的分割任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于patch的基础模型特征在显微镜图像分析中存在两个问题：1）难以表示微结构中的精细特征；2）难以处理材料科学和生物图像分析中的大尺寸图像

Method: 训练卷积神经网络，参考输入图像对低分辨率（大patch尺寸）的基础模型特征进行上采样，无需额外训练即可应用于各种显微镜图像的特征提取和分割

Result: 上采样后的丰富特征能够分离难以分割的相（如发丝裂纹），交互式分割使用这些深度特征能够以更少的标签和更快速度产生高质量分割结果

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于传统卷积网络的训练或微调，在显微镜图像分割任务中表现出色

Abstract: Feature foundation models - usually vision transformers - offer rich semantic
descriptors of images, useful for downstream tasks such as (interactive)
segmentation and object detection. For computational efficiency these
descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine
features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image
sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we
train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large
patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We
apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently
featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant
cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of
these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like
hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep
features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer
labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.

TL;DR: 提出了HCCM框架解决无人机场景中视觉语言理解的挑战，通过区域-全局对比学习和匹配机制，在GeoText-1652数据集上达到SOTA性能，并在零样本泛化上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机场景中宽视场和复杂组合语义对视觉语言理解构成挑战，主流VLM模型缺乏细粒度语义，现有分层方法依赖精确实体分割，在动态环境中效果有限

Method: 提出HCCM框架，包含两个组件：1) RG-ITC区域-全局图像文本对比学习，避免精确场景分割；2) RG-ITM区域-全局图像文本匹配，评估局部语义一致性。还引入MCD动量对比和蒸馏机制提高鲁棒性

Result: 在GeoText-1652数据集上达到28.8%的图像检索Recall@1和14.7%的文本检索Recall@1。在未见过的ERA数据集上实现39.93%的平均召回率，优于微调基线

Conclusion: HCCM框架有效解决了无人机场景中的视觉语言理解挑战，通过分层跨粒度对比和匹配学习实现了优异的性能和强大的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: Natural Language-Guided Drones (NLGD) provide a novel paradigm for tasks such
as target matching and navigation. However, the wide field of view and complex
compositional semantics in drone scenarios pose challenges for vision-language
understanding. Mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) emphasize global
alignment while lacking fine-grained semantics, and existing hierarchical
methods depend on precise entity partitioning and strict containment, limiting
effectiveness in dynamic environments. To address this, we propose the
Hierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)
framework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive
Learning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures
hierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with
global text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),
which dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic
consistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional
reasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,
destabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation
(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness. Experiments on GeoText-1652 show HCCM
achieves state-of-the-art Recall@1 of 28.8% (image retrieval) and 14.7% (text
retrieval). On the unseen ERA dataset, HCCM demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization with 39.93% mean recall (mR), outperforming fine-tuned
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出基于潜在扩散模型的单图像3D高斯泼溅场景重建方法，能够补全遮挡和未观察区域，生成高质量360度渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯泼溅方法需要密集观测，无法重建遮挡和未观测区域，回归方法只能预测单一模式导致模糊和不合理结果

Method: 使用变分自重构器从2D图像自监督学习潜在空间，然后训练扩散模型生成条件于单张输入图像的3D高斯泼溅表示分布

Result: 方法能够生成忠实重建和多样化样本，成功补全遮挡表面，实现高质量360度渲染

Conclusion: 提出的生成式方法解决了3D场景补全的模糊性问题，相比传统回归方法在遮挡区域重建方面表现更优

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can
fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,
including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.
Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the
ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a
regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and
out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to
capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem
partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,
reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the
input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a
distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single
input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a
Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a
self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method
generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to
complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

Motivation: 成对比较在主观标注任务中更可靠，但穷举比较需要O(n²)次标注，计算成本过高。需要一种更高效的标注方法来减少人工工作量

Method: 1) 使用CLIP模型进行分层零样本预排序 2) 初始化桶感知Elo分数 3) 运行不确定性引导的人机协同合并排序，用自动化比较替代简单明显的人工比较

Result: 在多个数据集上验证：人脸年龄估计(FGNET)、历史图像时序(DHCI)、视网膜图像质量评估(EyePACS)。相比穷举比较减少90.5%人工标注，相比先前工作减少19.8%标注量(n=100时)，同时保持或提高了评分者间可靠性

Conclusion: 结合CLIP先验知识和不确定性感知采样，为成对排序提供了高效可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal
classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved
reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of
annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden
(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting
algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering
items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model
hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human
comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a
CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,
and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation
was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical
image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It
showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to
exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =
100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results
demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling
yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Modeling human-object interactions (HOI) from an egocentric perspective is a
largely unexplored yet important problem due to the increasing adoption of
wearable devices, such as smart glasses and watches. We investigate how much
information about interaction can be recovered from only head and wrists
tracking. Our answer is ECHO (Ego-Centric modeling of Human-Object
interactions), which, for the first time, proposes a unified framework to
recover three modalities: human pose, object motion, and contact from such
minimal observation. ECHO employs a Diffusion Transformer architecture and a
unique three-variate diffusion process, which jointly models human motion,
object trajectory, and contact sequence, allowing for flexible input
configurations. Our method operates in a head-centric canonical space,
enhancing robustness to global orientation. We propose a conveyor-based
inference, which progressively increases the diffusion timestamp with the frame
position, allowing us to process sequences of any length. Through extensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods that do not
offer the same flexibility, setting a state-of-the-art in egocentric HOI
reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在通用场景上领先，但对城市场景的细粒度空间推理能力仍未充分探索。需要研究这些模型如何转移到专门的城市领域。

Method: 构建了一个基于街景图像分割、深度和物体检测预测的合成VQA数据集，每个问题都配有LLM生成的链式思维答案。对BLIP-2、InstructBLIP和LLaVA-1.5三个模型进行了零样本测试和精调对比。

Result: 零样本情况下VLMs表现较好，但使用合成CoT监督数据集精调后性能显著提升，尤其是在否定和反事实类问题上。

Conclusion: 城市空间推理是VLMs的新挑战，通过合成数据集构建可以有效地将通用模型适配到专门领域。

Abstract: Effectively understanding urban scenes requires fine-grained spatial
reasoning about objects, layouts, and depth cues. However, how well current
vision-language models (VLMs), pretrained on general scenes, transfer these
abilities to urban domain remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
conduct a comparative study of three off-the-shelf VLMs-BLIP-2, InstructBLIP,
and LLaVA-1.5-evaluating both zero-shot performance and the effects of
fine-tuning with a synthetic VQA dataset specific to urban scenes. We construct
such dataset from segmentation, depth, and object detection predictions of
street-view images, pairing each question with LLM-generated Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) answers for step-by-step reasoning supervision. Results show that while
VLMs perform reasonably well in zero-shot settings, fine-tuning with our
synthetic CoT-supervised dataset substantially boosts performance, especially
for challenging question types such as negation and counterfactuals. This study
introduces urban spatial reasoning as a new challenge for VLMs and demonstrates
synthetic dataset construction as a practical path for adapting general-purpose
models to specialized domains.

TL;DR: TFM是一个统一的生成轨迹方法，用于4D医学图像预测，通过学习底层时间分布，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样，在三个公共纵向数据集上超越现有方法。

Motivation: 医学成像中的时间动态理解对疾病进展建模、治疗计划和解剖发展追踪至关重要，但现有深度学习方法大多只考虑单一时间背景或专注于分类回归任务，缺乏细粒度空间预测能力。

Method: 提出Temporal Flow Matching (TFM)方法，通过学习底层时间分布，能够回退到最近图像预测器作为特例，支持3D体积、多先验扫描和不规则采样。

Result: 在三个公共纵向数据集上的广泛基准测试表明，TFM始终超越自然成像中的时空方法，为4D医学图像预测建立了新的最先进和鲁棒的基线。

Conclusion: TFM填补了医学图像时间动态建模的根本空白，提供了一个统一的生成框架，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for
applications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and
anatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either
consider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification
or regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.
While some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single
timepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address
this fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified
generative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal
distribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.
predicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports
$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive
benchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently
surpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new
state-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.

Motivation: 现有Leibovich评分在预测胆色细胞肾癌复发风险时存在病人级别分辨率有限且缺少形态学信息的问题。

Method: 采用预训练编码器和Cox生存模型的模块化深度学习框架，测试了单模态、后期融合和中间融合等不同设置。

Result: 病理图像基础模型表现优于CT模型，中间融合方式进一步提升性能，最佳模型接近调整Leibovich评分。

Conclusion: 证明了基础模型基础的多模态整合在个性化胆色细胞肾癌复发风险预测中的可行性，建议未来研究更表达力强的融合策略。

Abstract: Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is
essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich
score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers
limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study
evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed
tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A
modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival
modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion
setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently
outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.
Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model
(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random
tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,
suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using
simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal
integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore
more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and
general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机生成全息图领域提供了更灵活、更可解释的解决方案，有效突破了传统方法的限制，在性能和应用范围上都取得了显著改善。

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) has gained wide attention with deep
learning-based algorithms. However, due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature,
challenges remain in achieving accurate and stable reconstruction.
Specifically, ($i$) the widely used end-to-end networks treat the
reconstruction model as a black box, ignoring underlying physical
relationships, which reduces interpretability and flexibility. ($ii$) CNN-based
CGH algorithms have limited receptive fields, hindering their ability to
capture long-range dependencies and global context. ($iii$) Angular spectrum
method (ASM)-based models are constrained to finite near-fields.In this paper,
we propose a Deep Unfolding Network (DUN) that decomposes gradient descent into
two modules: an adaptive bandwidth-preserving model (ABPM) and a phase-domain
complex-valued denoiser (PCD), providing more flexibility. ABPM allows for
wider working distances compared to ASM-based methods. At the same time, PCD
leverages its complex-valued deformable self-attention module to capture global
features and enhance performance, achieving a PSNR over 35 dB. Experiments on
simulated and real data show state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 可提示模型有潜力在多示踪剂、多中心PET/CT中实现高效的用户引导分割工作流程。

Abstract: Whole-body PET/CT is a cornerstone of oncological imaging, yet accurate
lesion segmentation remains challenging due to tracer heterogeneity,
physiological uptake, and multi-center variability. While fully automated
methods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches
that keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The
autoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive
segmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present
our submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,
we extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided
foreground and background clicks as additional input channels. We
systematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate
that Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform
Gaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user
interactions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under
realistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with
and without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,
reducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.
These results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,
user-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT. Code

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优于最先进方法，特别是在nuScenes和长感知距离场景中改进显著

Conclusion: 提出的概率投影方法有效解决了HD地图构建中的泛化问题，提高了映射精度和可靠性

Abstract: Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately
mapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.
The precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final
vectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to
standard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these
methods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often
hallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a
geometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to
extract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we
propose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to
(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out
irrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,
we improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively
accumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the
nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over
state-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements
are particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception
range. Our code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统OCR技术存在字符分割错误问题，而现代单词级OCR将精度瓶颈转移到了单词分割。需要找到更好的方法来解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 行级OCR方法不仅提高了准确性和效率，还为利用大语言模型的进步提供了潜力，尤其适用于文档图像处理。

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each
character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character
segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in
sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first
detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly
output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of
language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe
that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word
segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical
progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to
bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for
better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not
only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough
literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark
such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a
meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level
annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy
improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning
towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4
times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With
continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds
potential to exploit such advances. Project Website:

TL;DR: FLORA提出了一种轻量级合成数据生成方法，使用LoRA微调Flux扩散模型，仅需消费级GPU和500张合成图像就能在目标检测任务上超越需要5000张图像和V100 GPU的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型数据增强方法需要大量计算资源和合成图像的问题，使合成数据生成更加高效和实用。

Method: 使用Flux 1.1 Dev扩散模型，通过Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)进行轻量级微调，大幅降低计算需求。

Result: 在7个目标检测数据集上，仅用500张合成图像就比ODGEN基线使用5000张图像的效果更好，mAP@.50:.95提升高达21.3%。

Conclusion: FLORA证明了质量优先、效率导向的方法比暴力生成更有效，使先进的合成数据生成技术更加实用和普及。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated
significant potential in augmenting scarce datasets for object detection tasks.
Nevertheless, most recent models rely on resource-intensive full fine-tuning of
large-scale diffusion models, requiring enterprise-grade GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA
V100) and thousands of synthetic images. To address these limitations, we
propose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation
pipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned
exclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces
computational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a
consumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our
approach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate
that training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our
approach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on
5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to
21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass
state-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves
superior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational
cost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is
more effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data
creation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.

*Amirhossein Nazeri,Wael Hafez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现对抗性扰动会在CNN激活层中产生可检测的熵特征，无需修改模型即可实现90%的检测准确率，误报率和漏报率均低于20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性攻击检测方法需要昂贵的重新训练、修改网络架构或降低干净输入的性能，需要一种无需模型修改的实时检测方案。

Method: 通过在VGG-16等CNN模型的早期卷积层并行监控激活熵，检测对抗性输入引起的熵值变化。

Result: 对抗性输入使早期卷积层激活熵产生7%的偏移，实现90%检测准确率，误报和漏报率均低于20%，干净和对抗性输入的熵分布完全分离。

Conclusion: CNN的可靠性可以通过激活熵单独评估，这为实时检测对抗性输入的自诊断视觉系统提供了实用部署方案，且不影响原始模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern
computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image
recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they
remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input
modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,
existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network
architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that
adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in
CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using
parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs
consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,
enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates
below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy
distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their
activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed
through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of
self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time
without compromising original model performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，通过利用3D CAD模型和高保真渲染生成数字测量设备的多模态数据集，显著提升了大视觉-语言模型在实际应用场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大视觉-语言模型在多模态任务上表现优异，但在实际应用场景中（如头戴摄像头和AR应用）面对杂乱、遮挡、极端视角和运动模糊等挑战时，读取数字测量设备值的能力仍有限。

Method: 开发CAD2DMD-SET合成数据生成工具，利用3D CAD模型、高级渲染和高保真图像合成技术生成多样化的数字测量设备VQA标签数据集。同时构建DMDBench验证集，包含1000张注释的实际图像。使用ANLS指标评估模型性能，并使用CAD2DMD-SET生成的数据对LVLM模型进行LoRA精调。

Conclusion: CAD2DMD-SET生成的训练数据集能够显著提高LVLM模型在具有挑战性条件的实际应用场景中的稳健性和性能。该工具将作为开源项目发布，允许社区添加不同测量设备并生成自己的数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,
however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital
Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving
clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in
head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by
these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data
generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks
involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and
high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled
synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present
DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images
designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.
Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein
Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with
CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL
showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This
demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the
robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated
challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as
open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the
community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出SSL-SaN自监督模型，通过引入静音和噪声训练策略，提高了声音源定位在正负样本情况下的性能，并提出了新的评估指标和扩展数据集IS3+。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉声音源定位方法在低音频-视觉语义对应情况下（如静音、噪声、屏幕外声音）表现不佳，且现有评估主要局限于单一可见声源的正样本场景。

Method: 提出新的训练策略，包含静音和噪声样本；开发自监督模型SSL-SaN；设计新的评估指标来衡量正负音频-视觉对的特征对齐和分离性；构建扩展数据集IS3+。

Result: SSL-SaN模型在声音定位和跨模态检索任务中达到了最先进的性能，对负样本声音具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过处理负样本音频提高了模型的鲁棒性，新的评估指标和数据集为更全面的音频-视觉对应研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims
to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite
recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most
approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic
correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the
presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to
positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single
visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key
contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates
silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being
more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,
SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other
self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.
Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment
and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative
audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of
the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI智能体是实现自动化设备操作的重要任务，但面临操作轨迹稀缺、交互基础设施不足以及基础模型能力有限等挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调处理各种GUI场景的感知和规划任务，然后开发课程强化学习框架支持复杂推理和在线环境探索。收集了超过100万步的操作轨迹数据。

Result: 在GUI感知、定位和规划基准测试中取得优异性能，特别是在中文移动应用交互方面表现突出。

Conclusion: UItron通过系统化的数据工程和交互基础设施，推动了GUI智能体向实际应用迈进一步，解决了现有解决方案在中文能力方面的普遍不足。

Abstract: GUI agent aims to enable automated operations on Mobile/PC devices, which is
an important task toward achieving artificial general intelligence. The rapid
advancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their
powerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,
building a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of
operation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the
limitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we
introduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,
featuring advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron
highlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive
infrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.
It not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to
enhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment
connecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised
finetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and
then develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex
reasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves
superior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.
In particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier
Chinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities
even in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one
million steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,
and build the offline and online agent evaluation environments. Experimental
results demonstrate that UItron achieves significant progress in Chinese app
scenarios, propelling GUI agents one step closer to real-world application.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLIP-DCA方法，通过增强域感知能力同时保持域不变分类来解决CLIP在域泛化评估中的性能下降问题，在33个多样化数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前域泛化评估对基础模型如CLIP来说不够挑战性，因为其预训练数据可能已覆盖现有基准。需要更好地评估CLIP在真实未见数据场景下的性能。

Method: 提出CLIP-DCA方法：1）使用单独域头识别和增强CLIP编码器中的域感知能力；2）通过合成多样化域数据；3）鼓励从域特征中解耦实现域不变分类

Result: CLIP-DCA在更具分布外特性的数据集上相比现有方法有显著改进，特别是在OOD程度更高的数据集上表现优异

Conclusion: 增强域感知能力是基础模型实现有效域不变分类的前提，CLIP-DCA通过解耦分类和域感知表示成功提升了域泛化性能

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is
challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing
benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently
challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better
assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP
encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating
on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'
some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance
deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present
CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware
representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while
standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,
this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of
domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead
hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective
domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and
enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head
and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages
domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain
features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging
evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more
OOD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在视频学习中使用非典型异常数据对开放世界学习的益处，发现即使简单的学习方法也能在OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别等任务中带来性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在开放世界中展示出卓越的泛化和发现能力，而现有研究主要关注封闭集中的典型数据。论文旨在探索非典型异常视频数据如何促进开放世界学习。

Method: 收集包含各种非典型视频数据的新数据集，将其用于模型训练进行表征学习，重点研究OOD检测、新类别发现和零样本动作识别三个关键任务。

Result: 实验表明，使用非典型数据能一致提升各任务性能：增加类别多样性可提升OOD检测性能；使用更小但语义更多样的非典型样本集在新类别发现任务中表现更好；非典型视频的语义多样性有助于零样本动作识别任务的泛化。

Conclusion: 非典型视频对开放世界视觉表征学习具有显著益处，新提出的数据集鼓励该方向的进一步研究。

Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the
open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing
studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,
open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are
interested in asking: \textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in
the learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting
of various types of unusual atypical data (\eg sci-fi, animation, \etc). To
study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into
the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key
tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel
category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found
that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently
improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that
increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD
detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more
semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance
compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the
semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to
unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental
evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation
learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,
encouraging further studies in this direction.

Motivation: 视频数据具有丰富的时空信息，但现有持续学习研究主要集中在有监督设置，需要标签和任务边界信息，这在现实中成本高昂且不实用。无监督视频持续学习面临更大挑战

Method: 使用无监督视频transformer提取深度特征，采用核密度估计(KDE)作为数据的非参数概率表示。引入新颖性检测标准动态扩展内存簇，利用迁移学习将先前任务知识传递到当前任务

Conclusion: 提出的非参数学习方法有效解决了无监督视频持续学习问题，为处理无标签、无任务边界的视频数据连续学习提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where
neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of
tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the
under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos
represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in
many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in
unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised
continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,
while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we
study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more
challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of
processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark
experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured
video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised
video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of
the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task
data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture
new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of
transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge
transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology
substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning
many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action
recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,
without using any labels or class boundaries.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于nnU-Net框架的多阶段级联预训练策略，用于胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)的MRI自动分割。通过数据增强方案的系统评估和定制化集成策略，在两个分割任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌的MRI自动分割面临肿瘤组织对比度差和标注数据稀缺的挑战，需要开发在有限数据条件下仍能保持高性能的分割方法。

Method: 采用nnU-Net框架，构建深度多阶段级联预训练策略：从通用解剖基础模型开始，依次在CT胰腺病变数据集和目标MRI模态上进行微调。通过五折交叉验证系统评估数据增强方案，并构建定制化的异构集成模型。

Result: 在Task 1中实现了最先进的边界精度(MASD 5.46 mm, HD95 17.33 mm)，最终提交的集成模型在Task 1和Task 2上分别获得了0.661和0.523的Tumor Dice分数。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限数据和复杂医学成像任务背景下开发专业化高性能模型提供了稳健的方法论，通过度量感知的集成策略有效解决了数据增强的权衡问题。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from MRI is
critical for clinical workflows but is hindered by poor tumor-tissue contrast
and a scarcity of annotated data. This paper details our submission to the
PANTHER challenge, addressing both diagnostic T1-weighted (Task 1) and
therapeutic T2-weighted (Task 2) segmentation. Our approach is built upon the
nnU-Net framework and leverages a deep, multi-stage cascaded pre-training
strategy, starting from a general anatomical foundation model and sequentially
fine-tuning on CT pancreatic lesion datasets and the target MRI modalities.
Through extensive five-fold cross-validation, we systematically evaluated data
augmentation schemes and training schedules. Our analysis revealed a critical
trade-off, where aggressive data augmentation produced the highest volumetric
accuracy, while default augmentations yielded superior boundary precision
(achieving a state-of-the-art MASD of 5.46 mm and HD95 of 17.33 mm for Task 1).
For our final submission, we exploited this finding by constructing custom,
heterogeneous ensembles of specialist models, essentially creating a mix of
experts. This metric-aware ensembling strategy proved highly effective,
achieving a top cross-validation Tumor Dice score of 0.661 for Task 1 and 0.523
for Task 2. Our work presents a robust methodology for developing specialized,
high-performance models in the context of limited data and complex medical
imaging tasks (Team MIC-DKFZ).

TL;DR: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，在多项选择题测试中准确率达92.8%，显著优于GPT-4和GPT-3.5，在真实病例治疗建议生成中也表现出良好的正确性和完整性，但仍有改进空间且需要专家监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估专门针对肿瘤学优化的新型大语言模型GPT-5在临床决策支持中的表现，特别是在放射肿瘤学领域的应用潜力。

Method: 使用两个基准测试：300道多项选择题的ACR放射肿瘤学培训考试和60个真实放射肿瘤学病例。由四位认证放射肿瘤学家评估治疗建议的正确性、完整性和幻觉现象。

Result: GPT-5在多项选择题测试中准确率92.8%，显著优于前代模型。在病例评估中，正确性评分3.24/4，完整性评分3.59/4，幻觉现象罕见但存在实质性错误。

Conclusion: GPT-5在放射肿瘤学领域表现优异，但生成的建议仍需专家严格监督，不能直接用于临床实践，还有进一步改进的空间。

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in
clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been
specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the
ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300
multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation
oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment
indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate
concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated
correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was
quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,
outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were
most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's
treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%
CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).
Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their
presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for
correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors
clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed
clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation
oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable
performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment
recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.
While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors
underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert
oversight before clinical implementation.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法主要依赖精心设计的图像特征提取器和记忆库来捕捉对象间的逻辑关系，但正常数据有限且逻辑异常检测仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出三记忆库框架：1) 类级文本记忆库用于逻辑异常检测；2) 对象级图像记忆库保持完整对象轮廓；3) 补丁级记忆库用于结构异常检测。通过多级检索和比较计算异常分数。

Conclusion: 通过协作记忆库统一结构和逻辑异常检测，TMUAD框架有效解决了异常检测中的关键挑战，并在多个领域数据集上表现出优异性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal
patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.
Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image
feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between
objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical
anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified
structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level
text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text
extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input
images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves
complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,
we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for
constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These
three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images
that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple
levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and
logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving
industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at

TL;DR: VoCap是一个灵活的视频模型，能够处理视频和多种模态提示（文本、框或掩码），生成时空掩码和对应的物体中心描述，同时解决可提示视频物体分割、指代表达分割和物体描述任务。


<details>

Motivation: 视频理解需要细粒度定位掩码和详细语义属性，但获取此类数据既繁琐又昂贵。为了解决这个问题，作者提出了VoCap模型和SAV-Caption数据集。

Method: 通过在现有大规模分割数据集（SAV）上使用伪物体描述进行标注，利用真实掩码预处理视频突出感兴趣物体，然后输入大型视觉语言模型生成描述。训练时混合使用SAV-Caption和其他图像视频数据集。

Conclusion: VoCap是一个有效的多任务视频理解模型，通过创新的数据标注方法和混合训练策略，在多个视频分析任务上表现出色，相关数据集将公开提供。

Abstract: Understanding objects in videos in terms of fine-grained localization masks
and detailed semantic properties is a fundamental task in video understanding.
In this paper, we propose VoCap, a flexible video model that consumes a video
and a prompt of various modalities (text, box or mask), and produces a
spatio-temporal masklet with a corresponding object-centric caption. As such
our model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object
segmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning. Since
obtaining data for this task is tedious and expensive, we propose to annotate
an existing large-scale segmentation dataset (SAV) with pseudo object captions.
We do so by preprocessing videos with their ground-truth masks to highlight the
object of interest and feed this to a large Vision Language Model (VLM). For an
unbiased evaluation, we collect manual annotations on the validation set. We
call the resulting dataset SAV-Caption. We train our VoCap model at scale on a
SAV-Caption together with a mix of other image and video datasets. Our model
yields state-of-the-art results on referring expression video object
segmentation, is competitive on semi-supervised video object segmentation, and
establishes a benchmark for video object captioning. Our dataset will be made

TL;DR: 本文发现场景识别中的动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出单正例多标签学习框架和GE-VerbMLP模型，在保持传统指标竞争力的同时实现3%以上的MAP提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词分类视为单标签问题，但视觉事件识别存在固有歧义性，同一图像可能被多个动词类别合理描述，需要重新审视这一设定。

Method: 将动词分类重新定义为单正例多标签学习问题，提出Graph Enhanced Verb MLP模型，结合图神经网络捕捉标签相关性和对抗训练优化决策边界。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持top-1和top-5准确率竞争力的同时，实现了超过3%的平均精度均值(MAP)提升。

Conclusion: 动词分类本质上是多标签问题，提出的SPMLL框架和GE-VerbMLP模型有效解决了视觉事件识别中的语义重叠问题，为场景识别任务提供了新的评估基准和方法论。

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims
to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events
and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model
must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify
the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),
and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).
Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we
show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address
the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories
may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key
contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb
classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous
semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of
fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to
reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning
(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a
comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully
designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To
address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb
Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to
capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision
boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach
achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on
traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

*Maolin Wei,Wanzhou Liu,Eshed Ohn-Bar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveQA是一个全面的开源文本和视觉基准测试，用于评估LLM和MLLM在驾驶知识测试中的表现，发现现有模型在数值推理、复杂路权场景等方面存在显著弱点，但通过微调可以显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶基准测试主要关注空间和视觉问答任务，但缺乏对交通规则、标志和路权原则的全面理解评估。人类驾驶员需要识别现实数据集中罕见的边缘案例，因此需要更全面的评估基准。

Method: 提出了DriveQA基准测试，包含文本和视觉模态，涵盖交通法规和场景。通过实验评估最先进的LLM和MLLM模型，并进行微调实验，还创建了DriveQA-V变体来测试模型对环境因素（光照、视角、距离、天气）的敏感性。

Result: 1）现有模型在基本交通规则上表现良好，但在数值推理、复杂路权场景、交通标志变体和空间布局方面存在显著弱点；2）在DriveQA上微调可提高多个类别的准确性，特别是在监管标志识别和交叉口决策方面；3）DriveQA-V揭示了模型对环境因素的敏感性；4）在DriveQA上预训练可提升下游驾驶任务性能，在nuScenes和BDD等真实数据集上取得更好结果。

Conclusion: DriveQA提供了一个全面的基准来评估AI模型的驾驶知识，揭示了现有模型的局限性，同时证明通过适当的训练，模型能够内化文本和合成交通知识，有效泛化到下游问答任务。

Abstract: If a Large Language Model (LLM) were to take a driving knowledge test today,
would it pass? Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks
on current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a
complete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way
principles. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases
that rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an
extensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers
traffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we
show that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on
basic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning
and complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial
layouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple
categories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection
decision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into
model sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,
distance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances
downstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world
datasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can
internalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively
across downstream QA tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了架构归纳偏置如何影响大语言模型在指导性对话中的认知行为，通过引入符号支架机制和短期记忆模式来促进苏格拉底式辅导中的结构化推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型的架构设计如何影响其在教学对话中的认知表现，特别是如何通过架构设计来促进更结构化和自适应的推理过程。

Method: 采用符号支架机制配合短期记忆模式，通过五个系统变体的对照消融实验，使用专家设计的评分标准评估模型输出，包括支架使用、响应性、符号推理和对话记忆等方面。

Result: 完整系统在所有基线变体中表现最优，移除记忆或符号结构会显著降低关键认知行为，包括抽象能力、自适应探测和概念连续性。

Conclusion: 架构支架能够可靠地塑造大语言模型中涌现的教学策略，支持处理层面的解释，表明架构设计对模型认知行为具有重要影响。

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior
of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a
symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed
to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using
controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via
expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic
reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an
LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This
enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in
early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system
consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing
memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including
abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings
support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can
reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as
ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task
completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in
scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations,
limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability
for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has
emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating
domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing
some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only
limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require
intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In
this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG
systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to
Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as
the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses
generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we
discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a
pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance
of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINKO是一个基于大语言模型的医疗本体集成学习框架，通过双轴知识传播（垂直和水平）来增强医疗概念表示学习，解决了现有方法只关注单一本体系统内部关系而忽略跨本体连接的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗本体学习方法主要关注单一本体系统或孤立地处理多个本体系统，缺乏统一的集成学习结构，导致概念表示学习局限于本体内部关系，忽略了跨本体的重要连接。

Method: 1) 使用LLM提供基于图检索增强的本体概念嵌入初始化；2) 通过双轴知识传播联合学习多本体图中的医疗概念：垂直传播（层级内）和水平传播（层级间并行）；3) 作为插件编码器与现有EHR预测模型兼容。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了LINKO相对于最先进基线的优越性能，在数据有限和罕见疾病预测场景中表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LINKO框架成功实现了多本体系统的集成学习，通过双轴知识传播机制显著提升了医疗概念表示学习效果，为EHR预测模型提供了更强大的编码能力。

Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但在简单交互任务中表现不佳，这凸显了陈述性知识和程序性知识之间的关键差距

Method: TiG将基于强化学习的决策重新表述为语言建模任务：LLM生成语言引导的策略，通过环境反馈的在线强化学习进行迭代优化

Result: TiG成功弥合了陈述性和程序性知识之间的差距，以显著更低的数据和计算需求实现了与传统RL方法相当的性能

Conclusion: TiG框架不仅提高了在复杂交互任务中的性能，还通过逐步自然语言解释大大提高了决策的透明度和可解释性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive
tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a
critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and
procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through
environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require
substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge
and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static
knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this
challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers
LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game
environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory
abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a
language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are
refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on
environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully
bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving
competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands
compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step
natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency
and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

TL;DR: AHELM是一个新的音频-语言模型基准测试，整合了多个数据集来全面评估10个重要方面，包括感知、推理、公平性等，并标准化了测试流程。测试了14个模型，发现Gemini 2.5 Pro在多个方面表现最佳但存在公平性问题，基线系统表现也出乎意料地好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-语言模型评估缺乏标准化基准，大多数基准只测试一两个方面，且忽略了公平性、安全性等重要评估维度。不同评估使用不同的提示方法和推理参数，导致模型间难以比较。

Method: 引入AHELM基准，整合多个数据集（包括两个新的合成音频-文本数据集PARADE和CoRe-Bench），标准化提示、推理参数和评估指标，在10个重要方面全面评估音频-语言模型性能。

Result: 测试了14个开源和闭源API模型及3个基线系统。Gemini 2.5 Pro在10个方面中的5个排名第一，但在ASR任务中表现出群体不公平性（p=0.01）。基线系统表现良好，其中一个仅具有语音转文本功能的系统总体排名第五。

Conclusion: AHELM提供了一个全面的标准化评估框架，揭示了当前音频-语言模型的优势和不足，特别是公平性问题。基准将持续更新，旨在促进该领域的透明和公平发展。

Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take
interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack
of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two
capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety.
Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test
a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference
parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that
aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets
called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and
CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through
inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the
performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the
development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion
detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety.
We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics
to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and
closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each
consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results
show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits
group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do
not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM,
with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities.
For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available
on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is
intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added
over time.

Motivation: 现有的遗忘操作主要基于经典逻辑，如变量消除和AGM信念修正理论中的收缩操作。本文旨在从认知状态的角度研究遗忘操作，利用更丰富的语义结构来探索认知背景下的遗忘含义。

Method: 采用认知状态视角，提出五种通用类型的认知遗忘，并在Spohn排序函数中实例化七种具体遗忘操作。借鉴逻辑编程和AGM理论中的遗忘公理，构建丰富的公理体系来评估不同遗忘操作。

Conclusion: 研究为认知状态下的遗忘操作提供了系统的理论框架，通过公理化方法揭示了不同遗忘操作的本质特征，为知识管理中的选择性遗忘提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of
the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many
facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a
conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing
forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable
elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to
focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic
programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief
revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical
deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we
take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic
states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional
logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic
background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to
the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and
instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking
functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic
programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating
forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations
according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview
highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

Motivation: 现有方法大多假设动作是完整的STRIPS动作或所有谓词都可观测，但实际场景中状态和动作信息往往不完整，需要更现实的模型学习方法

Method: 引入STRIPS+变体，允许动作参数在前提条件中隐式存在，SYNTH算法通过构建分层的前提表达式序列来学习模型，唯一标识状态中的对象并接地隐式参数

Conclusion: STRIPS+框架和SYNTH算法能够有效处理部分可观测环境下的模型学习问题，为现实场景中的动作模型学习提供了可行方案

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile
puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location
of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right,
with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the
states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the
atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not
full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the
actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different
versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the
traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all
observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as
the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states,
and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not
the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the
learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+,
where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions
which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The
learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+
state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH,
constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or
``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground
the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of
SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces
obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

TL;DR: MMSearch-Plus是一个新的多模态搜索基准测试，包含311个需要深度视觉推理的任务，旨在解决现有基准测试中浅层工作流的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态浏览基准测试往往可以通过浅层的固定工作流程解决，无法真正测试细粒度视觉推理、来源验证和长时程工具使用等真正多模态挑战。

Method: 采用时空外推法构建任务，要求从空间线索（微文本、部件外观、布局、标识）和时间痕迹（广播覆盖、季节上下文）外推到图像外的事实。提供模型无关的代理框架和浏览工具进行评估。

Result: 最强代理（o3）在无搜索情况下达到15.1%准确率，在框架下达到36.0%准确率；最强的开源模型（Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct）无搜索时为0.0%，20轮搜索后为6.9%。

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了当前模型在来源验证、基于部件的推理和长时程规划方面的失败，为多模态语言模型作为网络代理的能力提供了更真实的评估标准。

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web
agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed
workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the
genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance
verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a
benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while
preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each
item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that
must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and
cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure,
Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require
extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts,
signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to
out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a
model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of
closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search
and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source
model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20
rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and
cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in
source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

### [105] [Modeling Wise Decision Making: A Z-Number Fuzzy Framework Inspired by Phronesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21517)
*Sweta Kaman,Ankita Sharma,Romi Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模糊Z数的智慧推理计算框架，将智慧量化为包含分数和置信度的双属性表示，解决了传统自评方法无法捕捉智慧中不确定性和谦逊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智慧测量依赖自评报告，无法反映智慧固有的不确定性和谦逊特质。需要一种能够同时考虑多维度和置信度的计算框架来改进心理学测量并实现人性化AI。

Method: 使用模糊推理系统结合Z数（智慧分数+置信度），通过21条规则将五个理论基础的智慧成分整合。基于高斯核密度估计调整隶属函数，对100名参与者的道德困境语言反应进行分析。

Result: 概念验证研究表明，系统产生的双属性智慧表示与既定量表呈显著正相关，但与无关特质关系可忽略，支持了收敛效度和区分效度。

Conclusion: 该研究将智慧形式化为多维度的、考虑不确定性的构念，通过模糊Z数为AI系统提供可解释的、置信度敏感推理，在严格计算和类人判断之间找到安全中间地带。

Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective
taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action,
and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are
rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity,
requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures
depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent
in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both
multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological
science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z
numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score
(restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study,
participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral
dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which
were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of
each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with
membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In
a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom
representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established
scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting
convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to
formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct,
operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing
measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI
systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe,
middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

TL;DR: 计划领域的反事实场景解释方法，通过最小修改计划问题来实现特定属性要求，计算复杂度与计划计算相当


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实解释无法抓住问题的高层次特性，需要一种能够揭示问题本质属性的解释方法

Method: 提出基于反事实场景的新解释范式，通过对计划问题P进行最小修改，使其能够满足特定属性要求ψ的计划。提出两种定性实例化方法

Result: 证明了生成反事实场景的计算复杂度通常仅与计算计划的复杂度相当，显示了方法的实际可行性

Conclusion: 该方法为计划领域提供了一种实用的高层次解释框架，能够有效揭示问题的本质特性

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain
Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally
changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have
been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been
characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would
result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may
help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail
to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on
counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an
\ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual
scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that
comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of
counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that
must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of
generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are
allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only
as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical
viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct
practical algorithms in this area.

TL;DR: HealthProcessAI是一个基于GenAI的框架，通过集成多个大语言模型来自动解释过程挖掘结果并生成报告，简化了医疗领域过程挖掘的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过程挖掘在医疗领域应用面临技术复杂、缺乏标准化方法和实践培训资源有限等障碍，需要简化应用并提高结果的可理解性。

Method: 开发HealthProcessAI框架，整合Python(PM4PY)和R(bupaR)库，集成多个LLM进行自动过程图解释和报告生成，使用脓毒症进展数据进行验证。

Result: 框架成功处理了四个概念验证场景的脓毒症数据，LLM评估显示Claude Sonnet-4和Gemini 2.5-Pro获得最高一致性分数(3.79/4.0和3.65/4.0)。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构化分析和AI驱动解释，为将复杂过程挖掘结果转化为医疗应用的可操作见解提供了新颖的方法学进展。

Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for
understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces
significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized
approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce
HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining
applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive
wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address
unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple
Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and
report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that
diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis
progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five
state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its
functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four
proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its
capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation
using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model
strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency
scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By
integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation
and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with
process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data
scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven
interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in
translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights
for healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种发现跨域自动通用野标的新框架，通过学习解决过的实例来描述规划问题的中间目标，使用独立于具体对象的状态函数来提高重复性和通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野标提取算法在某些规划问题中效果不佳，需要一种能够自动通用于整个域的野标发现方法来描述中间目标。

Method: 使用状态函数扩展域的谓词，构建有向通用野标图，包括循环可能性来模型重复子计划的进展。将这些图用于解决同域新问题实例的启发式算法。

Result: 实验结果显示，从少量小型实例学习的通用野标图在同域更大实例中也有效。如果识别出表示重复的循环，启发式性能比基准方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通用野标能够捐取可解释且对自动规划器有用的域信息，这些信息可以从同域的少量计划中发现。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically
generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set
of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where
traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized
landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions
that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all
similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we
construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark
progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how
to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same
domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a
few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain.
If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant
improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks
capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated
planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the
same domain.

TL;DR: 本文提出了确定性分布式部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（Det-Dec-POMDPs）模型和一种叫IDPP的高效求解算法，专门处理大规模多机器人导航等确定性多自主规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Dec-POMDP求解器在处理大规模确定性多自主规划问题（如多机器人导航）时效率低下，需要专门优化的求解方法来应对这些领域的挑战。

Method: 提出Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP)算法，基于Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies框架，专门为确定性Det-Dec-POMDPs模型进行优化。

Result: IDPP算法能够高效处理当前Dec-POMDP求解器无法应对的大规模Det-Dec-POMDPs问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为确定性多自主规划问题提供了一种实用的解决方案，IDPP算法在处理大规模问题时显示出优异的性能。

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot
navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic
actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of
Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of
Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations
conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP
Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for
Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale
Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address
efficiently.

Conclusion: 未来将集成私有LLM、迁移学习、强化学习和贝叶斯神经网络，以增强可解释性、适应性和实时决策能力

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了A-MHA*算法，将多启发式A*（MHA*）扩展为随时算法，能够快速找到可行次优解并持续改进直到时间耗尽


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHA*虽然利用多个不可采纳启发式函数来加速搜索，但它是单次算法，无法随时间持续改进解质量，需要仔细设置膨胀因子

Method: 受ARA*算法启发，将ARA*的概念精确适配到MHA*框架中，开发了随时多启发式A*（A-MHA*）算法

Result: A-MHA*在3D路径规划和滑块拼图领域表现出色，相比MHA*和其他随时算法具有更好的性能

Conclusion: A-MHA*成功将MHA*扩展为随时算法，保持了原有的次优性和完备性保证，同时实现了持续改进解质量的能力

Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain
knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and
correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the
search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby
affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search
using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in
Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible
heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original
version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm
that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time
solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime
version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually
improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime
Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA*
concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and
completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.
Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain
and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEDLEY框架通过保留多个AI模型的多样性输出而非强制共识，将模型偏见视为潜在优势，为医疗AI系统提供透明化的诊断不确定性和偏见展示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将AI偏见视为需要消除的缺陷，但人类推理本身就包含偏见。研究认为偏见可能具有价值，需要一种新框架来利用AI模型的多样性。

Method: 提出MEDLEY概念框架，协调多个AI模型并保留其多样性输出。开发概念验证演示器，使用30多个大型语言模型，在合成病例中同时保留共识和少数观点。

Result: 演示器成功展示了如何保持诊断不确定性和潜在偏见的透明性，使临床医生能够进行监督。虽然还不是经过验证的临床工具，但证明了结构化多样性的价值。

Conclusion: MEDLEY通过重新定义AI不完美性为资源，为开发可信赖的医疗AI系统提供了范式转变，开辟了新的监管、伦理和创新途径。

Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect
requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases
shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be
inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble
Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that
orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather
than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that
suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential
strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician
verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large
language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both
consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty
and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated
clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can
enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI
imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new
regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽视科学文档的层次结构和文本视觉元素的语义整合，需要同时解决这两个挑战。

Method: 引入Poster Tree层次化中间表示来编码文档结构和视觉文本关系；采用多智能体协作策略，内容摘要和布局规划智能体迭代协调并提供相互反馈。

Result: 在多个学术领域的广泛实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中都优于现有基线，生成的海报质量最接近专家设计的地面真实结果。

Conclusion: 该框架能够联合优化逻辑一致性、内容保真度和视觉连贯性，在信息保存、结构清晰度和用户偏好方面表现优异。

Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for
automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely
neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic
integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both
challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical
intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and
visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a
multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content
summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual
feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency,
content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality
closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information
preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于旅行商问题的变分量子算法，通过紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略，在训练实例上优化电路结构后冻结并重用于新实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅行商问题的量子算法需要减少量子比特需求和计算成本，特别是在NISQ设备上实现时，需要降低结构搜索的开销。

Method: 使用紧凑排列编码减少量子比特需求，采用优化-冻结-重用策略：先用模拟退火优化训练实例的电路拓扑，然后冻结结构，在新实例上仅重新优化电路参数。

Result: 在4-7个城市的40个随机对称实例上，4城市达到100%最优路径采样概率，5城市90%，6城市80%，7城市降至约20%，显示方法的可扩展性限制。

Conclusion: 该方法在中等规模问题上表现出良好的泛化能力，冻结Ansatz能显著减少求解时间而不降低解质量，但存在可扩展性限制，有望扩展到车辆路径和作业车间调度等更复杂问题。

Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析中理解因果关系是一个核心挑战，特别是当完整因果结构未知时。专家通常能提供高层摘要因果图，但如何利用这种抽象知识来指导微观层面的因果发现需要理论保证。

Method: 提出了基于摘要因果图和忠实分布假设的理论条件，保证微观层面边的可定向性，即使在宏观层面存在循环或双向边的情况下。

Result: 建立了保证微观层面边定向的理论框架，为利用专家知识改进时间序列因果推断提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过合理利用摘要因果图和专家知识，可以在复杂时间系统中显著改善因果发现的效果，为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central
challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure
is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified,
experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal
graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal
relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level
details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability
of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge
encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and
causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our
results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level,
even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These
findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal
discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating
expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series
data.

*Hyeonseong Jeon,Cheolhong Min,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP)，一种零样本测试时规划框架，通过结构化轨迹生成平衡探索与利用，在非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的规划方法在凸可微奖励场景表现良好，但在现实世界的非凸目标、不可微约束和多奖励结构中效果显著下降。同时，监督规划方法需要任务特定训练，限制了测试时灵活性和零样本泛化能力。

Method: 将测试时规划构建为树搜索问题，采用双层采样过程：1) 通过无训练粒子引导生成多样化父轨迹以鼓励广泛探索；2) 通过任务目标引导的快速条件去噪精炼子轨迹。仅使用预训练模型和测试时奖励信号。

Result: 在三个多样化任务（迷宫金币收集、机械臂方块操作、AntMaze多目标探索）上评估，TDP在所有任务上始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TDP通过探索多样化轨迹区域并利用扩展解空间中的梯度信息，有效解决了梯度引导的局限性，为测试时规划提供了灵活且强大的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach
for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient
guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward
landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios
involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and
multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches
require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time
flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion
Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances
exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame
test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process:
(1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle
guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined
through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the
limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and
harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only
pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three
diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze
multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on all tasks. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体协作系统来模拟临床团队会诊，通过动态分配专家智能体进行层次化迭代辩论，在SOAP笔记的S和O部分识别临床问题，相比单智能体方法在识别心衰、急性肾损伤和脓毒症方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床叙述的准确解释对患者护理至关重要，但单一大语言模型方法缺乏高风险临床任务所需的鲁棒性，需要更可靠的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用协作式多智能体系统，由Manager智能体协调动态分配的专家智能体团队，通过层次化迭代辩论达成共识，模拟临床团队的诊断推理过程。

Result: 在420份MIMIC-III笔记数据集上评估，动态多智能体配置在识别充血性心力衰竭、急性肾损伤和脓毒症方面表现出持续改进的性能，定性分析显示该结构能有效呈现和权衡冲突证据。

Conclusion: 通过模拟临床团队的推理过程，该系统为开发更准确、鲁棒和可解释的临床决策支持工具提供了有前景的路径，尽管偶尔可能受到群体思维的影响。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care,
but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the
robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a
collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team
to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by
analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes,
simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an
assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of
specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a
consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated
dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration
demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart
failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent
debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting
evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling
a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward
more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Motivation: 传统自然语言处理技术不适用于银行支付消息系统（如SWIFT）中的交易对手方聚类，因为这些手动输入的标签缺乏句子结构但包含大量变体和噪声，现有模糊匹配工具效果有限。

Method: 采用混合方法：结合字符串相似度计算、主题建模、层次聚类和规则基础流水线，支持未知聚类数量的情况，并设计了基于精确率和召回率的评估指标。

Result: 在真实标注数据集上的测试显示，该方法相比基于规则的基线方法性能显著提升，同时保持了规则系统的可解释性，减少了人工审核需求。

When the structure and content falls in the natural language domain e.g.
Twitter posts or instant messages, then natural language techniques can be
used, provided texts are of sufficient length to allow for use of (pre)trained
models to extract meaningful information, such as part-of-speech or topic
annotations. However, natural language models are not suitable for clustering
transaction counterparties, as they are found in bank payment messaging
systems, such as SWIFT. The manually typed tags are typically physical or legal
entity details, which lack sentence structure, while containing all the
variations and noise that manual entry introduces. This leaves a gap in an
investigator or counter-fraud professional's toolset when looking to augment
their knowledge of payment flow originator and beneficiary entities and trace
funds and assets. A gap that vendors traditionally try to close with fuzzy
matching tools. With these considerations in mind, we are proposing a hybrid
string similarity, topic modelling, hierarchical clustering and rule-based
pipeline to facilitate clustering of transaction counterparties, also catering
for unknown number of expected clusters. We are also devising metrics to
supplement the evaluation of the approach, based on the well-known measures of
precision and recall. Testing on a real-life labelled dataset demonstrates
significantly improved performance over a baseline rule-based ('keyword')
approach. The approach retains most of the interpretability found in rule-based
systems, as the former adds an additional level of cluster refinement to the
latter. The resulting workflow reduces the need for manual review. When only a
subset of the population needs to be investigated, such as in sanctions
investigations, the approach allows for better control of the risks of missing
entity variations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial
intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes,
RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional
models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,
feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative
possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL
typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,
imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.
These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures
to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and
decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more
than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical
environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including
model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,
and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration
through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL
applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,
diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and
translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze
RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons
for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a
technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative
role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical
intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多粒度EEG情绪分类框架，在GAMEEMO数据集上使用LSTM-GRU模型，在二分类、多分类和多标签情绪分类任务中均取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG情绪识别研究大多局限于二分类或特定被试分类，限制了在真实情感计算系统中的泛化能力和部署应用。

Method: 使用14通道EEG数据和连续自评情绪数据，采用时间窗分割、混合统计和频域特征提取、z-score标准化的预处理策略，构建了二分类、多分类和多标签三种情绪编码方式，并比较了多种机器学习模型。

Result: LSTM-GRU模型表现最佳，在二分类任务中F1-score达到0.932，在多分类和多标签分类中准确率分别达到94.5%和90.6%。

Conclusion: 该多粒度框架为EEG情绪识别提供了更全面的解决方案，LSTM-GRU模型在复杂情绪分类任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising
outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches;
however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or
subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment
in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper
presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built
on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and
continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)
from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline
employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window
segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and
z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative
input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three
complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged
polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion
classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.
(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10
ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random
Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,
LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently
outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence
task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion
classification.

Result: 在9个数据集和2个领域的实验表明，PVPO达到了最先进的性能，不仅在多个任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，还在不同规模的模型上展现出可扩展的性能。

Conclusion: PVPO通过优势参考锚点和数据预采样的创新方法，显著降低了无评论家强化学习对rollout次数的依赖，提高了训练效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have
attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks.
However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within
the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local
optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose
PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage
reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference
model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a
reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias
introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the
number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty
during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to
improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two
domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our
approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but
also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

TL;DR: AdaGram是一种高效的全矩阵自适应梯度优化器，通过快速对称分解和矩阵积分器方法降低计算和内存开销，在标准机器学习任务中比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自适应梯度方法（如Adagrad）使用对角预处理矩阵，无法捕捉参数相关性。全矩阵自适应方法虽然能建模这些相关性，但计算和内存成本过高，限制了在大规模模型中的应用。

Method: 提出AdaGram优化器，采用快速对称分解计算每次迭代的预处理更新方向，并使用矩阵积分器方法保持预处理器的低秩结构，从而降低内存和计算开销。

Result: 在标准机器学习任务上的数值实验表明，当使用秩五及更小的秩近似时，AdaGram比对角自适应优化器收敛更快或性能相当。

Conclusion: AdaGram展示了作为大规模模型中自适应优化可扩展解决方案的潜力，能够有效平衡计算效率和收敛性能。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in
large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning
matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix
adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations
and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and
memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this
limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix
adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we
utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update
direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure
of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator
methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that
AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive
optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This
demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive
optimization in large models.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of
temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model
Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing
temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three
variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical
time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization.
The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature),
31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming
state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks.
Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights
revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining
multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work
advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and
transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building
control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Conclusion: 该研究为DSN设备的预主动维护提供了一套完整的机器学习解决方案，能够通过数据分析预先识别设备退化和异常，确保未来宇宙任务的可靠连接。

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities
that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities
contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long
periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and
threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep
Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment
with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly
pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and
continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space
missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine
learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive
analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets
through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained
and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a
reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on
severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each
anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time
through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have
also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction,
parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program
or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system,
we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data,
completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped
around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning
was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous
data.

Motivation: 现有监督学习方法需要完整的查询-LLM最优配对知识，但现实场景中缺乏这种完整映射且查询不断变化，需要更自适应的解决方案。

Method: 构建查询和LLM的共享嵌入空间反映亲和度，基于离线人类偏好数据初始化，通过在线老虎机反馈优化。提出PILOT算法（LinUCB扩展）和在线成本策略处理预算约束。

Result: 提出了一个能够自适应选择最适合LLM的框架，不需要对所有查询在所有LLM上进行完整推理，同时考虑成本效率。

Conclusion: 将LLM路由问题重新定义为上下文老虎机问题，提供了一种更实用和自适应的解决方案，能够处理现实世界中的不确定性和成本约束。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
but their varying capabilities and costs pose challenges in practical
applications. LLM routing addresses this by dynamically selecting the most
suitable LLM for each query/task. Previous approaches treat this as a
supervised learning problem, assuming complete knowledge of optimal query-LLM
pairings. However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and
face evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a
contextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit
feedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries
(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a
shared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are
aligned to reflect their affinity. This space is initially learned from offline
human preference data and refined through online bandit feedback. We
instantiate this idea through Preference-prior Informed Linucb fOr adaptive
rouTing (PILOT), a novel extension of LinUCB. To handle diverse user budgets
for model routing, we introduce an online cost policy modeled as a multi-choice
knapsack problem, ensuring resource-efficient routing.

Motivation: 现有的合成数据隐私审计框架依赖经验性假设和攻击模型的失败模式，无法有效检测通过合成数据发布造成的训练数据隐私泄漏。

Method: 提出Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA)，一种无需模型知识或访问权限的No-Box MIA方法。通过评估测试观测数据在代理模型中对合成数据局部可能性比率的影响，来进行成员推断攻击。

Result: 在涉及多种数据集、模型架构和攻击参数的综合性能测试中，Gen-LRA在多个性能指标上都一贵领先于其他生成模型MIA方法。

Conclusion: Gen-LRA作为一种高效的隐私审计工具，显著地揭示了生成模型过拟合在实际应用中带来的严重隐私风险。

Abstract: Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved
problem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on
heuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of
generative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the
privacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this
paper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically
exploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly
overfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose
Generative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally
efficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,
formulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a
surrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic
data. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently
dominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.
These results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for
the release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed
by generative model overfitting in real-world applications.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular
for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle
with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called
Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a
hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory
capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual
connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including
randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their
effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary
and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our
experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the
proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in
classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse
domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With
increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten},
several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to
forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a
particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult
to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for
tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as
a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate
non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model
approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end
unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful
unlearning performance.

Result: 证明了下一个token分布沿光滑轨迹收敛到softmax均衡；温度是时间的精确重缩放；top-k和nucleus采样将流限制在具有相同保证的面上。

Conclusion: 为解码过程提供了严格的数学框架，揭示了温度、采样策略等实践参数的理论基础，并为路径依赖的分数调整和幻觉行为提供了受控描述。

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and
normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this
step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The
discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical
multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is
the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context
and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside
the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the
common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The
analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an
exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus
sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline
a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection
to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training
dynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work.

Motivation: 近年来RL在LLMs应用中出现了许多反直觉现象，但这些现象的有效条件尚不明确，需要系统研究这些现象何时成立、何时失效。

Method: 通过系统全面的实验验证，分析不同模型架构和任务领域，测量模型-任务对齐程度（用pass@k准确率评估），检验各种反直觉RL主张的有效性。

Result: 研究发现标准RL训练在各种设置下都保持稳健，而许多反直觉结果只在模型与任务已经高度对齐时才出现，在更具挑战性的情况下这些技术无法驱动有效学习。

Conclusion: 模型-任务对齐程度是区分RL观察结果的关键因素，标准RL方法在困难场景中仍然有效，而反直觉技术仅在对齐良好时适用。

Abstract: Recent advances in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to large language
models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress. In particular, a series of
remarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,
exhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For
example, notable claims include that a single training example can match the
performance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not
need to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can
match or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise
conditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they
fail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that
differentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits
strong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated
task. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of
counterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across
different model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while
standard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these
counterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit
strong model-task alignment. In contrast, these techniques fail to drive
substantial learning in more challenging regimes, where standard RL methods
remain effective.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel generative continual learning framework based on
self-organizing maps (SOMs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to enable
memory-efficient replay, eliminating the need to store raw data samples or task
labels. For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a
VAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and
FashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a
running mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic
samples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based
method, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in
subsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental
benchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art
memory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving
over best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\% and $7$\%, respectively. Our methodology further
facilitates easy visualization of the learning process and can also be utilized
as a generative model post-training. Results show our method's capability as a
scalable, task-label-free, and memory-efficient solution for continual

*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sanjay Choudhry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合专家(MoE)的元学习框架，动态整合三种先进CFD代理模型的预测，在汽车空气动力学预测中显著降低了L-2误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD仿真计算成本高昂，现有ML代理模型架构多样但缺乏通用最优方案，需要利用架构多样性来提升预测精度

Method: 使用混合专家模型，通过门控网络动态组合DoMINO、X-MeshGraphNet和FigConvNet三种异构模型的预测，加入熵正则化防止模型坍塌

Result: 在DrivAerML数据集上验证，MoE模型显著降低了L-2预测误差，超越了集成平均和最准确的单个专家模型

Conclusion: MoE框架通过协同整合专业架构的互补优势，为创建更鲁棒准确的复合代理模型提供了有效策略

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains
a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While
ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate
aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly
evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single
model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel
meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a
strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated
gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three
heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable
multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph
neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution
network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,
assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in
predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model
collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy
regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is
trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark
of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative
results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2
prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most
accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This
work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for
creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically
combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

*Farnoush Rezaei Jafari,Oliver Eberle,Ashkan Khakzar,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Relevance Patching (RelP) 是一种新的机制可解释性方法，通过使用层间相关性传播(LRP)系数替代梯度，在保持计算效率的同时比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活修补是机制可解释性中定位模型组件的重要方法，但计算成本高；属性修补虽然更快但存在噪声问题且在深度非线性网络中可靠性降低。

Method: 提出Relevance Patching (RelP)，用Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的传播系数替代属性修补中的局部梯度，仅需两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在多种模型和任务上验证，RelP比标准属性修补更准确地近似激活修补，特别是在GPT-2 Large的IOI任务中，MLP输出的Pearson相关系数从0.006提升到0.956。

Conclusion: RelP在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了对激活修补的近似准确性，且与Integrated Gradients相比具有相当的忠实性但计算成本更低。

Abstract: Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for
localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it
is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a
faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced
reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce
Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution
patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the
layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local
propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or
improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only
two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency
while improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and
tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than
standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and
MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for
MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by
RelP. Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits
identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves
comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with
IG.

*Hossein KhademSohi,Hadi Hemmati,Jiayu Zhou,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedOwen是一个高效的联邦学习框架，使用Owen采样来近似计算Shapley值，在相同评估预算下比现有方法误差更小，并通过自适应客户端选择策略实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中准确估计每个客户端的贡献对于公平奖励和选择最有用的客户端至关重要，但精确计算Shapley值在客户端数量大时计算复杂度呈指数增长，不可行。

Method: 提出FedOwen框架，使用Owen采样来近似Shapley值，采用自适应客户端选择策略平衡利用高价值客户端和探索未充分采样的客户端。

Result: 在固定评估成本下，FedOwen在相同通信轮数内比现有最优基线在非IID基准测试上实现了高达23%的最终准确率提升。

Conclusion: FedOwen通过高效的Shapley值近似和智能客户端选择，显著提高了联邦学习的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aggregates information from multiple clients to train
a shared global model without exposing raw data. Accurately estimating each
client's contribution is essential not just for fair rewards, but for selecting
the most useful clients so the global model converges faster. The Shapley value
is a principled choice, yet exact computation scales exponentially with the
number of clients, making it infeasible for large federations. We propose
FedOwen, an efficient framework that uses Owen sampling to approximate Shapley
values under the same total evaluation budget as existing methods while keeping
the approximation error small. In addition, FedOwen uses an adaptive client
selection strategy that balances exploiting high-value clients with exploring
under-sampled ones, reducing bias and uncovering rare but informative data.
Under a fixed valuation cost, FedOwen achieves up to 23 percent higher final
accuracy within the same number of communication rounds compared to
state-of-the-art baselines on non-IID benchmarks.

*Roland Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G&L v1.0提出评估机器学习模型冷启动适应性的新框架，通过测量模型从未标注数据集中顺序学习时累积的错误数量，揭示传统终点指标无法观察到的适应速度、选择质量和偏差等动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习评估过于关注最终准确率，忽视了模型从零开始学习过程中的适应成本（累积错误）。现有评估方法无法捕捉模型早期学习阶段的效率和可靠性问题。

Method: 设计Guess-and-Learn框架，包含四个实验轨道（从头训练/预训练 × 在线/批量更新）。模型逐步选择实例、预测标签、接收真实标签并更新参数，记录错误轨迹。使用MNIST和AG News数据集，测试感知机、k-NN、CNN、ResNet-50、ViT-B/16、BERT-base等多种模型。

Result: 发现小模型在早期阶段能以较少初始错误适应，预训练效果因领域而异。所有当前模型性能都远低于理论oracle参考带，存在明显的适应性差距。在线学习模式下模型表现出不同的错误累积模式。

Conclusion: G&L框架通过量化早期学习的错误成本，补充了传统基准测试，为开发不仅最终准确而且在最初样本就可靠的模型提供了可复现的评估框架。

Abstract: Evaluation of machine learning models typically emphasizes final accuracy,
overlooking the cost of adaptation: the cumulative errors incurred while
learning from scratch. Guess-and- Learn (G&L) v1.0 addresses this gap by
measuring cold-start adaptability - the total mistakes a model makes while
sequentially labeling an unlabeled dataset. At each step, the learner selects
an instance, predicts its label, receives the ground truth, and updates
parameters under either online (per-sample) or batch (delayed) mode. The
resulting error trajectory exposes adaptation speed, selection quality, and
bias - dynamics invisible to endpoint metrics.
  G&L defines four tracks (Scratch/Pretrained $\times$ Online/Batch) to
disentangle the effects of initialization and update frequency. We formalize
the protocol, relate it to classical mistake-bound theory, and estimate a
heuristic "oracle reference band" for MNIST as a plausibility reference.
Baseline experiments on MNIST and AG News, spanning classical methods
(Perceptron, k-NN), convolutional architectures (CNN, ResNet-50), and
pretrained transformers (ViT-B/16, BERT-base), reveal systematic differences in
early-phase efficiency: smaller models can adapt with fewer initial errors,
while pretraining benefits vary by domain. Across settings, current models
remain well above the oracle band, highlighting an adaptability gap.
  By quantifying the mistake cost of early learning, G&L complements
conventional benchmarks and provides a reproducible framework for developing
learners that are not only accurate in the limit but also reliable from the
first examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CALM框架：基于Apache Beam和TimesFm的实时异常检测系统，通过持续微调和LLM判断机制应对非平稳时间序列中的概念漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练的异常检测模型在面对数据统计特性随时间变化的概念漂移时性能显著下降，需要开发能够实时适应数据变化的检测框架

Method: 构建基于Apache Beam分布式处理框架和TimesFm基础模型的端到端系统，包含持续微调机制和LLM-as-a-Judge组件进行语义判断

Result: 在TSB-UAD基准测试中，持续微调模型相比静态预训练基础模型在大多数数据集上提高了ROC AUC分数

Conclusion: CALM框架通过自适应和LLM引导的方法，在动态流式环境中有效维持高性能异常检测能力

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in non-stationary time-series streams is a
critical but challenging task across numerous industrial and scientific
domains. Traditional models, trained offline, suffer significant performance
degradation when faced with concept drift, where the underlying statistical
properties of the data change over time. This paper introduces CALM
(Continuous, Adaptive, and LLM-Mediated), a novel, end-to-end framework for
real-time anomaly detection designed to address this challenge. CALM is built
on the Apache Beam distributed processing framework and leverages the TimesFm
foundation model for forecasting-based anomaly detection. The framework's
novelty lies in two core contributions. First, it implements a closed-loop,
continuous fine-tuning mechanism that allows the anomaly detection model to
adapt to evolving data patterns in near real-time. Second, it introduces an
LLM-as-a-Judge component, a Large Language Model that provides semantic,
context-aware judgments on detected anomalies to curate a high-quality training
dataset, deciding whether an anomaly represents transient noise or a meaningful
pattern shift. We evaluate CALM on the comprehensive TSB-UAD benchmark. Our
results demonstrate that the continuously fine-tuned model improves the ROC AUC
score in most datasets compared to the static, pre-trained base model,
validating the efficacy of our adaptive, LLM-guided approach to maintaining
high-performance anomaly detection in dynamic streaming environments.

TL;DR: 本文探讨使用数据流学习技术检测肌电信号中的域偏移，通过KPCA预处理和多種漂移检测方法评估，发现现有技术在实时检测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌电信号具有固有的非平稳性，检测域偏移对于维持稳定的肌电解码模型至关重要，特别是在不同受试者和记录会话之间的域变化。

Method: 使用KPCA（余弦核）预处理肌电信号，评估CUSUM、Page-Hinckley和ADWIN等多種漂移检测方法，基于Ninapro数据库的DB6数据集进行实验。

Result: 现有漂移检测方法在肌电信号实时域偏移检测中表现不佳，性能有限，无法达到高精度检测要求。

Conclusion: 流式学习方法在维持肌电解码模型稳定性方面具有潜力，但需要进一步研究来提高在真实场景中的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Detecting domain shifts in myoelectric activations poses a significant
challenge due to the inherent non-stationarity of electromyography (EMG)
signals. This paper explores the detection of domain shifts using data stream
(DS) learning techniques, focusing on the DB6 dataset from the Ninapro
database. We define domains as distinct time-series segments based on different
subjects and recording sessions, applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis
(KPCA) with a cosine kernel to pre-process and highlight these shifts. By
evaluating multiple drift detection methods such as CUSUM, Page-Hinckley, and
ADWIN, we reveal the limitations of current techniques in achieving high
performance for real-time domain shift detection in EMG signals. Our results
underscore the potential of streaming-based approaches for maintaining stable
EMG decoding models, while highlighting areas for further research to enhance
robustness and accuracy in real-world scenarios.

*Shihao Ji,Zihui Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MyGO是一个受生物睡眠-觉醒周期启发的终身学习框架，通过生成式记忆模型在离线阶段生成伪数据来缓解灾难性遗忘，无需存储原始数据，在隐私和存储效率方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有持续学习方法面临的数据隐私、存储限制以及在任务不相似时性能下降的问题，特别是避免存储原始样本的需求。

Method: 采用觉醒-睡眠双阶段框架：觉醒阶段快速学习新任务并训练紧凑的生成模型；睡眠阶段使用所有生成模型生成伪数据，通过知识蒸馏将新旧知识整合到核心特征提取器中。

Result: 在计算机视觉(Split-MNIST)和自然语言处理(Split-AG News)基准测试中，MyGO显著缓解了灾难性遗忘，保持了跨任务的高平均准确率。

Conclusion: MyGO框架有效解决了持续学习中的关键挑战，证明了其在隐私保护、存储效率和跨领域通用性方面的优势。

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VILA是一种新的机器遗忘框架，通过更准确地识别与敏感信息相关的参数并显著降低计算成本，解决了FILA方法在参数重要性估计和计算效率方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成内容时可能无意中泄露敏感信息，完全重新训练模型计算成本过高，而现有的FILA等机器遗忘方法存在参数重要性估计不准确和需要访问全部模型参数的问题。

Method: VILA框架明确考虑了Fisher信息的基本假设，提高了遗忘集参数识别的准确性，同时无需访问整个模型即可进行参数识别，显著降低了计算成本。

Result: VILA相比FILA实现了高达100倍的参数效率和40倍的训练速度提升，在TOFU、WMDP和MUSE基准测试中达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VILA通过改进参数识别方法和降低计算需求，为机器遗忘提供了一种更高效、更准确的解决方案，能够有效移除模型中的敏感信息而无需从头训练。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but face
challenges related to unintentionally generating outputs containing sensitive
information. A straightforward approach to address this issue is to retrain the
model after excluding the problematic data. However, this approach incurs
prohibitively high computational costs. To overcome this limitation, machine
unlearning has emerged as a promising solution that can effectively remove
sensitive information without the need to retrain the model from scratch.
Recently, FILA has been proposed as a parameter-efficient unlearning method by
integrating LoRA adapters. Specifically, it calculates the Fisher information
to identify parameters associated with the forget set and assigns them to LoRA
adapters for updates. Despite its innovative approach, FILA still requires
access to all model parameters and does not adequately account for fundamental
assumptions underlying Fisher information, leading to inaccuracies in
importance estimation. To address these limitations, we propose VILA, a novel
unlearning framework that explicitly considers the assumptions overlooked in
FILA, thereby enhancing the accuracy of parameter identification for the forget
set. Moreover, VILA significantly reduces computational costs by enabling
parameter identification without accessing the entire model. Our method
achieves up to 100x higher parameter efficiency and 40x faster training speed
compared to FILA, and sets new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks
including TOFU, WMDP, and MUSE. Our code is available at

*Amit Sinha,Matthieu Geist,Aditya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析Q-learning算法收敛性的理论框架，针对使用代理状态（非信念状态）和策略正则化的Q-learning算法，证明了其在温和技术条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Q-learning算法在实践中广泛使用代理状态（如RNN状态）和策略正则化来促进探索和稳定学习，但缺乏对这些算法收敛性的理论理解。

Method: 提出了正则化代理状态Q-learning（RASQL）框架，分析其收敛性，并扩展到学习周期性策略的变体。通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明了RASQL在温和技术条件下收敛到正则化MDP的固定点，该固定点取决于行为策略诱导的平稳分布。数值实验证实了理论收敛行为。

Conclusion: 该研究为实践中常用的Q-learning算法提供了理论收敛保证，特别是针对使用代理状态和策略正则化的算法，填补了理论分析与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework to understand the convergence of
commonly used Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithms in practice. Two
salient features of such algorithms are: (i)~the Q-table is recursively updated
using an agent state (such as the state of a recurrent neural network) which is
not a belief state or an information state and (ii)~policy regularization is
often used to encourage exploration and stabilize the learning algorithm. We
investigate the simplest form of such Q-learning algorithms which we call
regularized agent-state-based Q-learning (RASQL) and show that it converges
under mild technical conditions to the fixed point of an appropriately defined
regularized MDP, which depends on the stationary distribution induced by the
behavioral policy. We also show that a similar analysis continues to work for a
variant of RASQL that learns periodic policies. We present numerical examples
to illustrate that the empirical convergence behavior matches with the proposed
theoretical limit.

### [141] [Distribution-Aware Feature Selection for SAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21324)
*Narmeen Oozeer,Nirmalendu Prakash,Michael Lan,Alice Rigg,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sampled-SAE是一种改进的稀疏自编码器方法，通过在批次级别进行特征选择来解决传统TopK SAE的效率问题，并通过可调节参数l在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间找到平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TopK SAE对每个token使用固定的K个最活跃潜在特征，效率低下且无法处理不同token信息量的差异。BatchTopK虽然改进了平均重建效果，但存在"激活彩票"问题，即罕见的高幅值特征会挤掉信息量更大但幅值较低的特征。

Method: 提出Sampled-SAE方法：对批次激活矩阵的列（特征）进行评分（使用L2范数或熵），形成大小为Kl的候选池，然后在受限的特征池中对批次中的token应用Top-K选择。参数l控制从批次级别到token特定选择的频谱。

Result: 在Pythia-160M模型上的实验表明，没有单一的l值能在所有指标上达到最优，最佳选择取决于共享结构、重建保真度和下游性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: Sampled-SAE将BatchTopK重新构建为一个可调节的、分布感知的方法家族，提供了在全局一致性和细粒度重建之间灵活权衡的能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose neural activations into interpretable
features. A widely adopted variant, the TopK SAE, reconstructs each token from
its K most active latents. However, this approach is inefficient, as some
tokens carry more information than others. BatchTopK addresses this limitation
by selecting top activations across a batch of tokens. This improves average
reconstruction but risks an "activation lottery," where rare high-magnitude
features crowd out more informative but lower-magnitude ones. To address this
issue, we introduce Sampled-SAE: we score the columns (representing features)
of the batch activation matrix (via $L_2$ norm or entropy), forming a candidate
pool of size $Kl$, and then apply Top-$K$ to select tokens across the batch
from the restricted pool of features. Varying $l$ traces a spectrum between
batch-level and token-specific selection. At $l=1$, tokens draw only from $K$
globally influential features, while larger $l$ expands the pool toward
standard BatchTopK and more token-specific features across the batch. Small $l$
thus enforces global consistency; large $l$ favors fine-grained reconstruction.
On Pythia-160M, no single value optimizes $l$ across all metrics: the best
choice depends on the trade-off between shared structure, reconstruction
fidelity, and downstream performance. Sampled-SAE thus reframes BatchTopK as a
tunable, distribution-aware family.

TL;DR: Stage-Diff是一个基于扩散模型的分阶段生成模型，专门用于生成长时间序列，通过分阶段生成和阶段间信息传递来平衡长期依赖和数据分布漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时间序列具有复杂的长期时间模式和分布漂移，现有生成模型难以同时处理长期依赖关系和分布变化，以及序列内和序列间的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 提出Stage-Diff模型：1）分阶段序列生成和阶段间信息传递来保持长期依赖并建模分布漂移；2）每个阶段内进行渐进序列分解，在不同时间尺度上进行通道独立建模；3）阶段间信息传递采用多通道融合建模。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的大量实验验证了Stage-Diff在长时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Stage-Diff通过分阶段生成和混合建模策略，成功解决了长时间序列生成中的长期依赖、分布漂移以及序列内外依赖关系平衡等关键挑战。

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列合成方法基于随机序列进行时间建模，难以保证生成时间序列的时间依赖性，且难以准确捕获原始时间序列特征信息

Method: 将时间序列生成过程分解为序列特征提取和序列重构两个阶段，形成完整的时间序列自编码器，并结合生成对抗网络生成与真实序列特征向量对齐的合成特征向量

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的大量实验证明了该模型在各种评估指标上的优越性

Conclusion: DLGAN是一个简单但有效的生成模型，能够有效解决时间序列合成中的时间依赖性和特征捕获问题

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 针对大规模神经网络优化中泛化能力不足的问题，基于梯度噪声的重尾分布特性和Edge of Stability现象，旨在通过动态噪声调整来寻找更稳定的宽盆地最小值

Method: AHTSGD算法在训练早期注入重尾噪声增强探索，随着锐度稳定逐渐过渡到轻尾噪声，根据损失景观锐度自适应调整注入噪声的性质

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10等基准测试中 consistently优于SGD和其他基于噪声的方法，在SVHN等噪声数据集上表现尤为突出，加速了从不良初始化的早期训练

Conclusion: AHTSGD通过动态适应损失景观锐度，有效促进向宽盆地的加速收敛，在干净和噪声设置下均能提升泛化性能，且对学习率选择具有鲁棒性

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms
often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One
key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that
wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually)
promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in
input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more
sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the
inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient
descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in
which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy
Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects
heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to
enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as
sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss
landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide
basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise
into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD
consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like
MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It
ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves
generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过分析Leela Chess Zero的策略网络发现，神经网络表示构建并非平滑渐进，而是存在复杂的非平滑轨迹，包括早期发现但随后丢弃的正确解、与最终输出相关性低的移动排名，以及直到网络后期仍存在的高策略分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络是否通过平滑渐进的方式构建表示，还是通过更复杂的计算过程，通过分析超人类象棋引擎的策略网络来探索这一问题。

Method: 扩展logit lens技术来分析Leela Chess Zero策略网络，考察各层的下棋强度和解题能力，分析策略分布的变化轨迹。

Result: 发现虽然下棋强度和解题能力在各层呈现强单调趋势，但策略分布经常遵循非平滑轨迹，包括正确解早期发现后被丢弃、移动排名与最终输出相关性低、直到网络后期仍存在高策略分歧。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示构建过程比语言模型中观察到的平滑分布收敛更为复杂，存在显著的非平滑计算特征。

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual
refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by
extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a
superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength
and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently
follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle
solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings
that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence
until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth
distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

TL;DR: PMODE是一个模块化的混合密度估计框架，通过数据分区和分别拟合估计器来构建混合模型，支持参数化和非参数化组件，并在高维异常检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统混合模型在处理不同分布族组件时的局限性，以及将理论方法扩展到高维实际应用场景的需求。

Method: 采用数据分区策略，将数据分成多个子集，为每个子集分别拟合密度估计器（可以是参数化或非参数化的），构建混合模型框架。

Result: PMODE达到了该类估计器的近乎最优收敛速率，即使混合组件来自不同分布族也保持有效性。MV-PMODE版本成功扩展到数千维的高维密度估计，在CIFAR-10异常检测任务中与深度基线方法竞争性相当。

Conclusion: PMODE提供了一个通用且模块化的混合建模框架，能够有效处理复杂的高维密度估计问题，并在实际应用中展现出良好的性能。

Abstract: We introduce PMODE (Partitioned Mixture Of Density Estimators), a general and
modular framework for mixture modeling with both parametric and nonparametric
components. PMODE builds mixtures by partitioning the data and fitting separate
estimators to each subset. It attains near-optimal rates for this estimator
class and remains valid even when the mixture components come from different
distribution families. As an application, we develop MV-PMODE, which scales a
previously theoretical approach to high-dimensional density estimation to
settings with thousands of dimensions. Despite its simplicity, it performs
competitively against deep baselines on CIFAR-10 anomaly detection.

<details>

Motivation: 开发一种非侵入式、低成本的网络监控方法，利用现成的匿名聚合移动网络数据来监测通信和移动网络的状态

Method: 将移动网络数据视为加权网络，初始化为回声状态网络(ESN)，使用储层计算框架将输入信号投影到高维空间，通过单层训练层进行操作，使用神经科学启发的代理任务训练模型

Result: 实验显示代理任务性能与网络状态相关，性能在特定网络配置下表现良好，当网络受到扰动时性能明显下降

Conclusion: 该方法可作为概念验证，有望发展为近实时监控工具，用于识别移动通信网络和交通网络的潜在弱点

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the
possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with
a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a
model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's
performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on
these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this
approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the
reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method.
Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated
form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted
network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks
as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state
network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on
which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep
neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use
neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then
show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how
it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as
proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time
monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile
communication networks as well as transportation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并技术通常独立处理每一层，忽略了深度网络中固有的层间依赖关系，导致分布不匹配问题，特别是在激活统计量方面。

Method: CoM采用分层合并过程，以自回归方式更新激活统计量，显式考虑跨层交互，通过一系列条件最优更新产生一致的合并模型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoM实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: CoM方法通过有效处理层间依赖和协变量偏移问题，为多任务模型合并提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models has become a standard pathway to achieve
state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of domains, leading to a
proliferation of task-specific model variants. As the number of such
specialized modules in-creases, merging them into a unified model without
retraining has become a critical challenge. Existing merging techniques often
rely on interference heuristics,importance weighting, or activation matching
while treating each layer independently, thereby failing to account for the
inter-layer dependencies inherent in deep networks. This simplification leads
to distributional mismatches, especially inactivation-based methods, when
changes in early layers are not properly reflected in downstream ones. We
identify these mismatches as a form of internal covariate shift, comparable to
the phenomenon encountered in the initial phases of neural networks training.
To address it, we propose Chain of Merges (CoM), a layer-wise merging procedure
that updates activation statistics in an auto-regressive fashion, explicitly
accounting for cross-layer interactions. CoM produces a coherent merged model
through a series of conditionally optimal updates, effectively mitigating
degradation caused by covariate shift. Experiments on standard bench-marks
demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 混合量子/经典GAN方法在检测突发料源变异导致的异常时显示出更高的检测率

Conclusion: 混合量子/经典方法在复杂连续生物制造过程中具有解决实际问题的潜力

Abstract: The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合标准期望累积奖励和时间平均增长率的新型强化学习算法，通过几何平均和滑动窗口估计器来优化个体轨迹的长期性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL算法优化期望累积奖励，但实际部署时个体轨迹性能更重要。需要同时考虑整体平均和个体轨迹的长期表现。

Method: 定义了时间平均增长率的Bellman算子，提出使用几何平均和N滑动窗口的修正几何平均作为估计器，并将其作为正则化项嵌入目标函数中。

Result: 在具有挑战性的仿真环境中，该算法优于传统的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将整体平均和时间平均相结合，为RL算法提供了同时优化期望累积奖励和个体轨迹长期性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图数据规模的扩大，双曲空间等黎曼流形数据空间受到关注。传统NML主要针对欧几里得空间设计，依赖于坐标系选择，难以直接扩展到黎曼流形。

Method: 定义了坐标变换不变的Rm-NML，扩展了现有NML计算技术到黎曼流形，并推导了在黎曼对称空间上简化计算的方法。

Result: 提出的Rm-NML在欧几里得空间自然参数化下与传统NML一致，并在双曲空间上的正态分布中进行了具体计算验证。

Conclusion: Rm-NML为黎曼流形上的模型选择和遗憾最小化提供了几何结构感知的新方法，特别适用于具有层次结构的图数据分析。

Abstract: In recent years, with the large-scale expansion of graph data, there has been
an increased focus on Riemannian manifold data spaces other than Euclidean
space. In particular, the development of hyperbolic spaces has been remarkable,
and they have high expressive power for graph data with hierarchical
structures. Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) is employed in regret
minimization and model selection. However, existing formulations of NML have
been developed primarily in Euclidean spaces and are inherently dependent on
the choice of coordinate systems, making it non-trivial to extend NML to
Riemannian manifolds. In this study, we define a new NML that reflects the
geometric structure of Riemannian manifolds, called the Riemannian manifold NML
(Rm-NML). This Rm-NML is invariant under coordinate transformations and
coincides with the conventional NML under the natural parameterization in
Euclidean space. We extend existing computational techniques for NML to the
setting of Riemannian manifolds. Furthermore, we derive a method to simplify
the computation of Rm-NML on Riemannian symmetric spaces, which encompass data
spaces of growing interest such as hyperbolic spaces. To illustrate the
practical application of our proposed method, we explicitly computed the Rm-NML
for normal distributions on hyperbolic spaces.

Conclusion: CByG框架在真实药物发现应用中具有有效性和实用性

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged
generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model
performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug
discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility
and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous
evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of
conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule
generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a
novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based
conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific
guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme
incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility,
and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework
significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation
criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug
discovery applications.

Conclusion: 未来贝叶斯强化学习研究应重点关注开发更合适的似然函数和先验分布，本文为深度Q学习提供了简单可实现的更好先验解决方案

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve
exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been
popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far
the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation,
instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions
underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold
posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory,
performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To
identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on
the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically
study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common
Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing
more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian
reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions
for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期退出模型主要依赖信心度基准的退出策略，但研究发现基准测量可能是误导性的指标：基准良好的分类器仍可能浪费计算，而常见基准方法不能保持样本排名。

Method: 研究者分析了基准测量的局限性，并通过实验展示了错误基准网络出性能超过基准网络的情况。作为替代方案，提出使用失败预测作为早期退出模型性能的代理指标。

Result: 实验结果显示，失败预测能够更好地考虑样本排名的变化，与效率改善呈现强相关性，而基准测量则与效率改善的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 失败预测是设计和评估早期退出模型的更可靠基础，因为它更能反映实际的效率改善效果，而非仅仅是分类器的信心度基准程度。

Abstract: Early-exit models speed up inference by attaching internal classifiers to
intermediate layers of the model and allowing computation to stop once a
prediction satisfies an exit criterion. Most early-exit methods rely on
confidence-based exit strategies, which motivated some works to calibrate
intermediate classifiers to improve the performance of the entire model. In
this paper, we show that calibration measures can be misleading indicators of
the performance of multi-exit models: a well-calibrated classifier may still
waste computation, and common calibration methods do not preserve the sample
ranking within a classifier. We demonstrate empirical cases where miscalibrated
networks outperform calibrated ones. As an alternative, we propose to use
failure prediction as a more useful proxy for early-exit model performance.
Unlike calibration, failure prediction accounts for changes in the ranking of
samples and shows a strong correlation with efficiency improvements, making it
a more dependable basis for designing and evaluating early-exit models.

Conclusion: SNN-DT通过将序列建模与神经形态效率结合，为嵌入式设备上的实时低功耗控制开辟了新途径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.

Result: 序列化格式选择显著影响LLM的性能和公平性，某些格式如GReat和LIFT能提高F1分数但加剧公平性差距；ICL相对零样本基线提升性能4.9-59.6%，但对公平性的影响因数据集而异

Conclusion: 需要有效的表格数据表示方法和公平性感知模型来提高LLM在金融决策中的可靠性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
decision-making tasks, such as loan approvals. While their applications expand
across domains, LLMs struggle to process tabular data, ensuring fairness and
delivering reliable predictions. In this work, we assess the performance and
fairness of LLMs on serialized loan approval datasets from three geographically
distinct regions: Ghana, Germany, and the United States. Our evaluation focuses
on the model's zero-shot and in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Our
results reveal that the choice of serialization (Serialization refers to the
process of converting tabular data into text formats suitable for processing by
LLMs.) format significantly affects both performance and fairness in LLMs, with
certain formats such as GReat and LIFT yielding higher F1 scores but
exacerbating fairness disparities. Notably, while ICL improved model
performance by 4.9-59.6% relative to zero-shot baselines, its effect on
fairness varied considerably across datasets. Our work underscores the
importance of effective tabular data representation methods and fairness-aware
models to improve the reliability of LLMs in financial decision-making.

Conclusion: 图曲率分析为GNN在SAT问题上的性能限制提供了几何解释，这一发现可为现有求解器设计原则提供理论依据，并指明未来研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for
Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of
logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder
instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental
architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation
through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local
connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random
k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature
decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based
SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range
dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations.
We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm
that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used
to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles
of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

Conclusion: 虽然技术上可行，但数据最小化在实践中仍面临挑战，其实际效果依赖于技术设置和用户特征，使得统一的数据"必需性"标准难以实施

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to
be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this
principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,
remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on
minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a
novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and
investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that
substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without
significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically
determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,
choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference
complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude
that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on
the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity'
difficult to implement.

Abstract: We introduce a novel wearable textile-garment featuring an innovative

enhancing signal fidelity in Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. We present a
comprehensive, sex-balanced evaluation involving 15 healthy males and 15
healthy female participants to ensure the device's suitability across
anatomical and physiological variations. The assessment framework encompasses
distinct evaluation approaches: quantitative signal quality indices to
objectively benchmark device performance; rhythm-based analyzes of
physiological parameters such as heart rate and heart rate variability; machine
learning classification tasks to assess application-relevant predictive
utility; morphological analysis of ECG features including amplitude and
interval parameters; and investigations of the effects of electrode projection
angle given by the textile / body shape, with all analyzes stratified by sex to
elucidate sex-specific influences. Evaluations were conducted across various
activity phases representing real-world conditions. The results demonstrate
that the textile system achieves signal quality highly concordant with
reference devices in both rhythm and morphological analyses, exhibits robust
classification performance, and enables identification of key sex-specific
determinants affecting signal acquisition. These findings underscore the
practical viability of textile-based ECG garments for physiological monitoring
as well as psychophysiological state detection. Moreover, we identify the
importance of incorporating sex-specific design considerations to ensure

Result: PINNs表现出更好的泛化能力，在误差减少方面优于数据驱动模型，在动态电网操作中保持较低的MAE，可靠地捕捉状态转换，而传统模型表现不稳定。

Conclusion: PINNs作为智能电网替代模型的范式转变工具，将数据驱动的灵活性与第一性原理的严谨性相结合，对安全关键应用至关重要，推动了实时电网控制和可扩展数字孪生的发展。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach
for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning
frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical
consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs'
capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their
performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three
key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory
prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions
(enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we
demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in
error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic
grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and
expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic
performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs
consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical
applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a
paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven
flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid
control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware
architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Conclusion: 通过洞察蒸馏框架，LLMs能够更好地将其通用知识和能力与特定表格任务的要求对齐，为少样本表格分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies show the promise of large language models (LLMs) for few-shot
tabular classification but highlight challenges due to the variability in
structured data. To address this, we propose distilling data into actionable
insights to enable robust and effective classification by LLMs. Drawing
inspiration from human learning processes, we introduce InsightTab, an insight
distillation framework guided by principles of divide-and-conquer, easy-first,
and reflective learning. Our approach integrates rule summarization, strategic
exemplification, and insight reflection through deep collaboration between LLMs
and data modeling techniques. The obtained insights enable LLMs to better align
their general knowledge and capabilities with the particular requirements of
specific tabular tasks. We extensively evaluate InsightTab on nine datasets.
The results demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
Ablation studies further validate the principle-guided distillation process,
while analyses emphasize InsightTab's effectiveness in leveraging labeled data
and managing bias.

Method: 开发了OceAn Salinity Imputation System (OASIS)，一种新颖的扩散对抗框架

Conclusion: OASIS框架为海洋盐度数据填补提供了新的解决方案，能够更好地处理稀疏数据和整合物理协变量

Abstract: Ocean salinity plays a vital role in circulation, climate, and marine
ecosystems, yet its measurement is often sparse, irregular, and noisy,
especially in drifter-based datasets. Traditional approaches, such as remote
sensing and optimal interpolation, rely on linearity and stationarity, and are
limited by cloud cover, sensor drift, and low satellite revisit rates. While
machine learning models offer flexibility, they often fail under severe
sparsity and lack principled ways to incorporate physical covariates without
specialized sensors. In this paper, we introduce the OceAn Salinity Imputation
System (OASIS), a novel diffusion adversarial framework designed to address
these challenges.

Conclusion: 该分析揭示了优化过程的动态特性，扩展了现有梯度下降分析结果，为随机优化方法在PINNs训练中的应用提供了理论支撑

Abstract: Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a very popular class of
neural solvers for partial differential equations. In practice, one often
employs stochastic gradient descent type algorithms to train the neural
network. Therefore, the convergence guarantee of stochastic gradient descent is
of fundamental importance. In this work, we establish the linear convergence of
stochastic gradient descent / flow in training over-parameterized two layer
PINNs for a general class of activation functions in the sense of high
probability. These results extend the existing result [18] in which gradient
descent was analyzed. The challenge of the analysis lies in handling the
dynamic randomness introduced by stochastic optimization methods. The key of
the analysis lies in ensuring the positive definiteness of suitable Gram
matrices during the training. The analysis sheds insight into the dynamics of
the optimization process, and provides guarantees on the neural networks
trained by stochastic algorithms.

Abstract: Decision theories offer principled methods for making choices under various
types of uncertainty. Algorithms that implement these theories have been
successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems, including
materials and drug discovery. Indeed, they are desirable since they can
adaptively gather information to make better decisions in the future, resulting
in data-efficient workflows. In scientific discovery, where experiments are
costly, these algorithms can thus significantly reduce the cost of
experimentation. Theoretical analyses of these algorithms are crucial for
understanding their behavior and providing valuable insights for developing
next-generation algorithms. However, theoretical analyses in the literature are
often inaccessible to non-experts. This monograph aims to provide an
accessible, self-contained introduction to the theoretical analysis of commonly
used probabilistic decision-making algorithms, including bandit algorithms,
Bayesian optimization, and tree search algorithms. Only basic knowledge of
probability theory and statistics, along with some elementary knowledge about
Gaussian processes, is assumed.

TL;DR: 使用情感和时间特征预测社交媒体参与度的机器学习方法，模型对点赞预测效果极佳（R²=0.98），但对评论预测效果一般（R²=0.41）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用情感和时间元数据来预测社交媒体内容（特别是音乐）的参与度（评论和点赞），以了解影响用户参与行为的关键因素。

Method: 基于600首歌曲的情感标注数据（效价、唤醒度等），使用HistGradientBoostingRegressor多目标回归模型，对经过对数变换的参与度比率进行训练，以处理目标变量的偏斜分布。

Result: 模型在点赞预测上表现优异（R²=0.98），但在评论预测上效果较差（R²=0.41），表明点赞主要受情感和曝光信号影响，而评论还依赖其他未包含的特征因素。

Conclusion: 情感和时间元数据结合现有观看次数能有效预测未来参与度，但点赞和评论的驱动因素存在显著差异，需要进一步研究评论的额外影响因素。

Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting social media engagement
(comments and likes) from emotional and temporal features. The dataset contains
600 songs with annotations for valence, arousal, and related sentiment metrics.
A multi target regression model based on HistGradientBoostingRegressor is
trained on log transformed engagement ratios to address skewed targets.
Performance is evaluated with both a custom order of magnitude accuracy and
standard regression metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R^2).
Results show that emotional and temporal metadata, together with existing view
counts, predict future engagement effectively. The model attains R^2 = 0.98 for
likes but only R^2 = 0.41 for comments. This gap indicates that likes are
largely driven by readily captured affective and exposure signals, whereas
comments depend on additional factors not represented in the current feature
set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保深度学习模型在真实应用中的可靠性，需要有效区分训练分布内数据(ID)和分布外数据(OOD)，特别是在不同分布偏移程度下的检测需求

Method: 使用奇异值分解分类头权重矩阵，将模型激活分解为决定性成分（对分类输出贡献最大）和非显著成分（贡献最小）。远OOD检测利用非显著子空间，近OOD检测利用决定性子空间

Result: 在多个标准OOD基准测试中取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过分析分类头权重的奇异值分解，可以找到对OOD检测更有效的特征子空间，远OOD和近OOD需要不同的处理策略，ActSub方法成功结合了这两种策略

Abstract: To ensure the reliability of deep models in real-world applications,
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods aim to distinguish samples close to
the training distribution (in-distribution, ID) from those farther away (OOD).
In this work, we propose a novel OOD detection method that utilizes singular
value decomposition of the weight matrix of the classification head to
decompose the model's activations into decisive and insignificant components,
which contribute maximally, respectively minimally, to the final classifier
output. We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively
distinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large
distribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective
leaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that
are ''untainted'' by the target classification task. Conversely, in regimes of
smaller distribution shifts (Near-OOD), we find that activation shaping methods
profit from only considering the decisive subspace, as the insignificant
component can cause interference in the activation space. By combining two
findings into a single approach, termed ActSub, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in various standard OOD benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 估计本地事件对具体社区精神健康的特定影响对公共卫生政策至关重要。纯粹预测精神健康分数提供的见解有限，而准实验设计能够从观测数据中推断更接近因果关系的效应。

Method: 将LRDD适配到统计学习框架中，通过社区的历史分数、动态协变量(其他运行评估)和外生变量(静态表征)来预测未来的断点(时间特定变化)和斜率变化(线性轨迹)。

Result: 在COVID-19事件对美国县级焦虑的预测中，任务很难但通过提升模型精度可以实现，最佳结果来自外生和动态协变量的集成。方法在断点(r=+0.46)和斜率(r=+0.65)预测上都显著超过传统静态社区表征。

Conclusion: 断点预测为估计未来或假想事件对具体社区的特异影响带来了新可能性，在公共健康预测领域有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating community-specific mental health effects of local events is vital
for public health policy. While forecasting mental health scores alone offers
limited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,
quasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity
Design (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are
more likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the
size of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for
anxiety) due to a time-specific event. Here, we propose adapting LRDDs beyond
traditional forecasting into a statistical learning framework whereby future
discontinuities (i.e. time-specific shifts) and changes in slope (i.e. linear
trajectories) are estimated given a location's history of the score, dynamic
covariates (other running assessments), and exogenous variables (static
representations). Applying our framework to predict discontinuities in the
anxiety of US counties from COVID-19 events, we found the task was difficult
but more achievable as the sophistication of models was increased, with the
best results coming from integrating exogenous and dynamic covariates. Our
approach shows strong improvement ($r=+.46$ for discontinuity and $r = +.65$
for slope) over traditional static community representations. Discontinuity
forecasting raises new possibilities for estimating the idiosyncratic effects
of potential future or hypothetical events on specific communities.

TL;DR: SLAC开发了SNL框架和Auto-SNL工具，用于在FPGA上部署实时机器学习推理模型，解决了高能物理实验中TB/s级数据流的实时处理挑战，相比现有工具hls4ml在延迟和资源使用方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCLS-II自由电子激光器产生高达1MHz的X射线脉冲，探测器数据吞吐量超过1TB/s，传统数据传输和存储成本过高，需要实时机器学习数据压缩方案，但常规实现延迟过高无法满足高速实验需求。

Method: 开发SLAC神经网络库(SNL)框架，支持在FPGA上部署实时ML推理模型，关键特性是能够动态更新模型权重而无需FPGA重新综合。还开发了Auto-SNL Python扩展，可将Python神经网络模型转换为SNL兼容的高级综合代码。

Result: 与当前最先进工具hls4ml的基准测试比较显示，SNL在大多数测试的神经网络架构中实现了竞争性或更优的延迟性能，在某些情况下还提供了FPGA资源节省。

Conclusion: SNL展示了其多功能性，为高能物理、医学成像、机器人等领域的研究人员和学者开辟了新的机会，解决了高速实验环境中的实时数据处理挑战。

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

<details>

Motivation: 现有多标签排序方法仅利用正负标签二分信息，忽略了正标签间的排序信息，无法建模类别重要性差异

Method: 通过正标签排序建模隐式类别相关性概率分布，引入8个合成数据集解决数据稀缺和标注偏差问题

Result: 统计证明方法能准确学习与真实排序一致的表示，且与底层重要性值成比例

Conclusion: UniMLR框架有效统一了多标签排序和分类任务，通过利用正标签排序信息显著提升了性能

Abstract: Existing multi-label ranking (MLR) frameworks only exploit information
deduced from the bipartition of labels into positive and negative sets.
Therefore, they do not benefit from ranking among positive labels, which is the
novel MLR approach we introduce in this paper. We propose UniMLR, a new MLR
paradigm that models implicit class relevance/significance values as
probability distributions using the ranking among positive labels, rather than
treating them as equally important. This approach unifies ranking and
classification tasks associated with MLR. Additionally, we address the
challenges of scarcity and annotation bias in MLR datasets by introducing eight
synthetic datasets (Ranked MNISTs) generated with varying
significance-determining factors, providing an enriched and controllable
experimental environment. We statistically demonstrate that our method
accurately learns a representation of the positive rank order, which is
consistent with the ground truth and proportional to the underlying
significance values. Finally, we conduct comprehensive empirical experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the value of our proposed
framework.

Motivation: 心率预测在现实部署中面临数据异质性挑战，包括设备源异质性（不同设备特征集不同）和用户异质性（个体生理模式差异）。现有方法要么丢弃设备特定信息，要么无法建模用户差异，限制了实际性能。

Method: 提出学习对两种异质性都不敏感的潜在表示框架：使用随机特征丢弃策略处理源异质性，使模型对各类特征集具有鲁棒性；采用时间感知注意力模块捕获长期生理特征，并结合对比学习目标构建判别性表示空间。

Result: 在新建的ParroTao数据集和公开FitRec数据集上，模型分别比现有基线方法性能提升17%和15%。学习到的表示具有很强的判别能力，下游应用任务验证了模型的实用价值。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了心率预测中的数据异质性问题，通过创新的特征处理和表示学习方法，显著提升了模型在真实世界数据上的性能表现，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and
fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in
real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source
heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and
user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across
individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific
information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their
real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns
latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream
predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.
Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source
heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user
heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term
physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a
discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of
real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,
ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that
our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,
respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates
their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm
the practical value of our model.

Motivation: 现实医疗环境中多模态数据往往不完整或存在差异，现有方法需要完整模态数据或依赖人工选择策略，限制了在真实临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出MoE-Health框架，使用专门的专家网络和动态门控机制，根据可用数据模态动态选择和组合相关专家，实现灵活的数据可用性适应。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合多模态信息，在处理异构和不完整医疗数据方面提供改进的预测性能和鲁棒性，特别适合部署在数据可用性多样化的医疗环境中。

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic
Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively
leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as
real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing
approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection
strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where
data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework
designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health
architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing
modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging
specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach
dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data
modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability
scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical
clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of
stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal
fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality
availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal
information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in
handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly
suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous
data availability.

TL;DR: QR-LoRA是一种参数高效微调方法，通过QR分解提取预训练权重的正交基，仅训练标量系数来大幅减少可训练参数数量，在GLUE任务上性能优于全微调和标准LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA变体使用SVD初始化更新矩阵，但SVD在大模型上计算昂贵且奇异向量难以解释，需要更高效和结构化的参数高效微调方法。

Method: 使用QR分解与列主元法从预训练权重矩阵提取正交基，将LoRA更新表示为这些基向量的线性组合，仅训练标量系数。

Result: 在GLUE任务上，QR-LoRA仅用601个参数就达到或超过全微调、标准LoRA和SVD-LoRA的性能，参数减少量相比全微调超过1000倍，比典型LoRA设置少77倍。

Conclusion: QR-LoRA提供了一种结构清晰、参数极少的有效微调方法，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算和存储需求。

Abstract: The growing scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the
development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) has emerged as a promising approach, reducing the number of trainable
parameters by applying low-rank updates to pretrained weights. While standard
LoRA learns both update factors directly, several recent variants first
initialize those matrices via an SVD of the pretrained weights -- an operation
that can be expensive on large models and yields singular vectors that are not
always easy to interpret. In this work, we extract an orthonormal basis from
the pretrained weight matrix using QR decomposition with column pivoting, and
then express the LoRA update as a linear combination of these basis vectors --
training only the scalar coefficients, which imposes clear structure on
adaptation and drastically reduces parameter count. Experiments across GLUE
tasks show that QR-LoRA matches or exceeds the performance of full fine-tuning,
standard LoRA, and SVD-LoRA (LoRA with update matrices initialized via singular
value decomposition) with as few as 601 parameters -- a reduction of over 1000x
compared to full fine-tuning and 77x fewer than typical LoRA setups.

Abstract: As privacy regulations such as the GDPR and HIPAA and responsibility
frameworks for artificial intelligence such as the AI Act gain traction, the
ethical and responsible use of real-world data faces increasing constraints.
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution to risk-aware
data sharing and model development, particularly for tabular datasets that are
foundational to sensitive domains such as healthcare. To address both privacy
and fairness concerns in this setting, we propose FLIP (Fair Latent
Intervention under Privacy guarantees), a transformer-based variational
autoencoder augmented with latent diffusion to generate heterogeneous tabular
data. Unlike the typical setup in fairness-aware data generation, we assume a
task-agnostic setup, not reliant on a fixed, defined downstream task, thus
offering broader applicability. To ensure privacy, FLIP employs R\'enyi
differential privacy (RDP) constraints during training and addresses fairness
in the input space with RDP-compatible balanced sampling that accounts for
group-specific noise levels across multiple sampling rates. In the latent
space, we promote fairness by aligning neuron activation patterns across
protected groups using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity measure
extending the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This alignment
encourages statistical independence between latent representations and the
protected feature. Empirical results demonstrate that FLIP effectively provides
significant fairness improvements for task-agnostic fairness and across diverse
downstream tasks under differential privacy constraints.

TL;DR: 本文研究中介增强的两人正规形式博弈中的引导问题，通过信息和激励设计将玩家引导至特定行动配置。分析了信息设计的局限性，提出了结合一次性信息设计和重复博弈的新方法，提高了收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在中介的博弈中，如何通过信息和激励设计来引导玩家达到期望的行动配置，解决单纯信息设计或次线性支付的局限性。

Method: 首先分析成功引导的条件，然后提出结合一次性信息设计和重复博弈的增强方法，将先验交互转化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 证明了该方法能以高概率将玩家行动配置的收敛速度提高一个常数因子，并通过实证结果支持理论结论。

Conclusion: 提出的增强方法有效解决了信息设计的局限性，显著提高了引导效率，为中介引导博弈提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a steering problem in a mediator-augmented
two-player normal-form game, where the mediator aims to guide players toward a
specific action profile through information and incentive design. We first
characterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we
establish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always
achievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear
payment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments
required per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred
with information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a
one-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,
transforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we
theoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of
players' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high
probability, and support it with empirical results.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种透明、轻量且可复现的方法，能够对大型语言模型进行"脑部扫描"，识别指导其推理的英文概念，并在保持其他因素不变的情况下进行引导控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算机科学新兴技术的发展，研究人员需要一种方法来理解和控制大型语言模型的经济预测行为，识别影响其推理的关键概念（如情绪、技术分析和时机），并能够校正或模拟偏见。

Method: 通过"脑部扫描"技术识别LLM中的英文概念，建立概念与模型推理的映射关系，在保持其他因素恒定的情况下对模型进行引导控制，计算不同概念的相对重要性。

Result: 该方法能够成功将LLM生成的经济预测映射到具体概念，计算各概念的重要性而不降低性能，并能引导模型表现出不同程度的风险规避、乐观或悲观倾向。

Conclusion: 该方法为社会科学实证研究提供了一种透明、轻量且可复现的工具，能够有效分析和控制LLM的行为特征，有助于校正偏见和进行模拟研究。

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan"
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as
sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative
importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,
lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.

TL;DR: 该研究填补了推荐系统中群体公平性和个体公平性关系理解的空白，通过综合比较两种公平性的评估指标，发现高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的公平性通常分为群体公平和个体公平，但之前的研究使用不同的评估指标或目标，导致无法正确比较两种公平性类型的关系，也不清楚提升一种公平性如何影响另一种。

Method: 通过对可用于两种公平性类型的评估指标进行全面比较，在3个数据集上对8个运行进行了实验分析。

Result: 实验表明，高度群体公平的推荐可能对个体非常不公平，这一发现对推荐系统实践者改进系统公平性具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 该研究首次揭示了群体公平性和个体公平性之间的潜在冲突关系，为推荐系统公平性优化提供了新的科学认识，代码已开源供实践者使用。

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group
fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific
understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work
on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives
for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the
two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness
may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and
individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures
that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3
datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very
unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners
aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 传统推荐系统对新用户（冷启动用户）由于交互历史有限难以提供准确推荐，且现有方法往往依赖敏感人口统计数据，存在隐私问题。

Method: 结合Double DQN和Dueling DQN两种深度强化学习变体，与矩阵分解模型集成，从稀疏反馈中动态学习用户偏好，不依赖人口统计信息。

Result: 在大型电商数据集上实验表明，该方法（特别是Dueling DQN）相比基于流行度和主动学习等传统方法表现更优，有效降低了冷启动用户的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私受限环境下的冷启动用户推荐问题提供了有效解决方案，通过强化学习从稀疏反馈中学习用户偏好，既保护隐私又提升推荐准确性。

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users
with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem.
This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse
feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive
demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix
factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce
dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active
learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly
Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an
effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Diff-MSIN框架，通过多模态特征增强、协同关系捕获和特征动态自适应融合三个模块，解决多模态CTR预测中模态间共性与特性分离不足以及协同效应建模不充分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTR预测方法主要基于ID模态，无法全面建模用户的多模态偏好。现有多模态融合方法未能有效分离不同模态的共性与特性，也未考虑模态间的协同效应和复杂交互。

Method: 提出Diff-MSIN框架，包含三个创新模块：多模态特征增强模块(MFE)、协同关系捕获模块(SRC)和特征动态自适应融合模块(FDAF)。MFE和SRC模块提取模态间的协同、共性和特殊信息，FDAF模块捕获用户偏好并减少融合噪声。还设计了知识解耦方法以增强特征区分度。

Result: 在Rec-Tmall和三个Amazon数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线至少提升1.67%，证明了其在增强多模态推荐系统方面的潜力。

Conclusion: Diff-MSIN框架有效解决了多模态CTR预测中的关键挑战，通过创新的模块设计实现了模态间信息的有效分离和协同建模，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to
model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods
are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to
comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is
necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing
to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate
prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle
commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to
consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex
interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based
Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through
prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal
Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module,
and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC
Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different
modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities,
improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among
different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the
FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To
validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive
experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results
demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least
1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing
multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ImmunoAI是一个机器学习框架，通过梯度提升模型预测高亲和力抗体，将抗体发现时间从10-12个月大幅缩短，搜索空间减少89%，并成功识别出针对hMPV病毒的高效抗体候选物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏肺病毒(hMPV)对儿童、老年人和免疫功能低下人群构成严重威胁，传统抗体发现流程耗时10-12个月，限制了快速应对疫情暴发的能力。

Method: 开发ImmunoAI机器学习框架，使用213个抗体-抗原复合物数据集提取几何和物理化学特征，训练LightGBM回归器预测结合亲和力，并利用AlphaFold2预测hMPV A2.2变体的3D结构。

Result: 模型将抗体候选物搜索空间减少89%，在SARS-CoV-2数据集上RMSE从1.70降至0.92，成功识别出两个针对关键突变位点(G42V和E96K)的皮摩尔级亲和力抗体。

Conclusion: ImmunoAI显著缩短了设计周期，实现了更快、基于结构信息的病毒暴发应对能力，为快速抗体发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) poses serious risks to pediatric, elderly, and
immunocompromised populations. Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require
10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This
project introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates
antibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using
gradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D
topological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes
was curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM
regressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The
model reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on
117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from
1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2
variant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model
identified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting
key mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for
experimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables
faster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks.

Motivation: 随着高通量生物数据集的增加，需要自动化方法来构建生物医学系统的数字孪生，以指导药物发现和个性化治疗，但目前仍依赖人工数据整合。

Method: 综述并评估了从生物时间序列推断数字孪生的方法，主要包括符号回归和稀疏回归，并提出了八个评估标准来比较不同算法。

Result: 稀疏回归（特别是贝叶斯框架）通常优于符号回归，深度学习和大语言模型在整合先验知识方面展现出潜力，但需要提高可靠性和一致性。

Conclusion: 学习数字孪生的进展将来自混合模块化框架，结合化学反应网络的机理基础、贝叶斯不确定性量化和深度学习的生成与知识整合能力，并提出了基准测试框架来评估方法。

Abstract: Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如最大均值差异(MMD)在高维和非紧致域中表现不佳，需要一种更强大的概率分布比较工具。

Method: 将概率测度嵌入希尔伯特空间中的量子态(正定、单位迹算子)，构建量子概率度量，扩展了基于核的方法。

Result: QPMs能够均匀逼近所有有界一致连续函数，在高维中对细微分布差异更敏感，可作为MMD的直接替代品显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合量子力学和经典概率论的数学框架，为分析和操作概率测度提供了强大的新工具。

Abstract: Comparing probability distributions is a core challenge across the natural,
social, and computational sciences. Existing methods, such as Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD), struggle in high-dimensional and non-compact domains. Here
we introduce quantum probability metrics (QPMs), derived by embedding
probability measures in the space of quantum states: positive, unit-trace
operators on a Hilbert space. This construction extends kernel-based methods
and overcomes the incompleteness of MMD on non-compact spaces. Viewed as an
integral probability metric (IPM), QPMs have dual functions that uniformly
approximate all bounded, uniformly continuous functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$,
offering enhanced sensitivity to subtle distributional differences in high
dimensions. For empirical distributions, QPMs are readily calculated using
eigenvalue methods, with analytic gradients suited for learning and
optimization. Although computationally more intensive for large sample sizes
($O(n^3)$ vs. $O(n^2)$), QPMs can significantly improve performance as a
drop-in replacement for MMD, as demonstrated in a classic generative modeling
task. By combining the rich mathematical framework of quantum mechanics with
classical probability theory, this approach lays the foundation for powerful
tools to analyze and manipulate probability measures.

TL;DR: 提出基于随机加权支持点的生成建模框架，无需概率假设或神经网络，通过优化算法生成高质量多样化样本，计算成本远低于GAN和DDPM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持点通过代表性点集来概括大数据集，但传统方法缺乏生成多样性样本的能力。本文旨在开发一个基于随机加权支持点的生成框架，既能保持数据底层结构，又能产生解释性强的多样化样本。

Method: 采用Dirichlet过程和贝叶斯自助法启发的随机加权方案，结合凸凹过程(CCP)优化算法，从固定数据集生成随机加权支持点。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA-HQ数据集上的实验表明，该方法能以极低计算成本产生高质量多样化输出，性能优于GAN和DDPM等黑盒方法。

Conclusion: 随机加权支持点提供了一个原则性、可扩展且可解释的生成建模替代方案，能够产生真正插值性样本并保持底层数据结构。

Abstract: Support points summarize a large dataset through a smaller set of
representative points that can be used for data operations, such as Monte Carlo
integration, without requiring access to the full dataset. In this sense,
support points offer a compact yet informative representation of the original
data. We build on this idea to introduce a generative modeling framework based
on random weighted support points, where the randomness arises from a weighting
scheme inspired by the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. The
proposed method generates diverse and interpretable sample sets from a fixed
dataset, without relying on probabilistic modeling assumptions or neural
network architectures. We present the theoretical formulation of the method and
develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Convex--Concave
Procedure (CCP). Empirical results on the MNIST and CelebA-HQ datasets show
that our approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs at a fraction of
the computational cost of black-box alternatives such as Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) or Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). These
results suggest that random weighted support points offer a principled,
scalable, and interpretable alternative for generative modeling. A key feature
is their ability to produce genuinely interpolative samples that preserve
underlying data structure.

<details>

Motivation: 传统GMMNs在拟合copula随机数生成器时存在性能限制，需要改进带宽选择和训练过程以提高模型性能

Method: 引入自适应带宽选择程序，基于训练损失相对误差动态增加核数量，使用验证损失相对误差作为早停准则，构建自适应训练GMMNs(AGMMNs)

Result: AGMMNs训练时间与GMMNs相当但性能显著提升，在高维copula(维度达100)的准随机与伪随机样本收敛速率、篮子看涨期权期望收益和风险度量ES等应用中表现优于GMMNs和传统参数copula模型

Conclusion: 自适应训练方法有效提升了GMMNs的性能，在copula建模和金融应用中都显示出优于传统方法的预测能力

Abstract: An adaptive bandwidth selection procedure for the mixture kernel in the
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for fitting generative moment matching networks
(GMMNs) is introduced, and its ability to improve the learning of copula random
number generators is demonstrated. Based on the relative error of the training
loss, the number of kernels is increased during training; additionally, the
relative error of the validation loss is used as an early stopping criterion.
While training time of such adaptively trained GMMNs (AGMMNs) is similar to
that of GMMNs, training performance is increased significantly in comparison to
GMMNs, which is assessed and shown based on validation MMD trajectories,
samples and validation MMD values. Superiority of AGMMNs over GMMNs, as well as
typical parametric copula models, is demonstrated in terms of three
applications. First, convergence rates of quasi-random versus pseudo-random
samples from high-dimensional copulas are investigated for three functionals of
interest and in dimensions as large as 100 for the first time. Second,
replicated validation MMDs, as well as Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo
applications based on the expected payoff of a basked call option and the risk
measure expected shortfall as functionals are used to demonstrate the improved
training of AGMMNs over GMMNs for a copula model fitted to the standardized
residuals of the 50 constituents of the S&P 500 index after deGARCHing. Last,
both the latter dataset and 50 constituents of the FTSE~100 are used to
demonstrate that the improved training of AGMMNs over GMMNs and in comparison
to the fitting of classical parametric copula models indeed also translates to
an improved model prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DePIN市场虽然发展迅速（市值超100亿美元），但由于缺乏监管和AI代理的自主部署，存在效率低下和与人类价值观不对齐的风险，需要新的框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: 开发了EconAgentic框架，基于大语言模型模拟AI代理对代币激励的响应、基础设施投资决策和市场适应行为，并与人类启发式基准进行比较分析。

Result: EconAgentic能够有效分析DePIN市场的效率、包容性和稳定性，为去中心化代币化经济的设计和治理提供有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅有助于学术理解，还能实际改进去中心化经济的运行机制，确保市场结果与社会目标保持一致。

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.

Motivation: 生物神经元的树突具有高效信息处理能力，但现有SNN很少匹配树突的复杂结构，希望通过模拟树突的非线性结构和稀疏特性来提升SNN效率

Method: 引入非线性树突整合(NDI)改进神经元时空信息表示，实现树突棘的异质状态转换比，构建新的非线性突触剪枝(NSP)方法实现高稀疏度

Result: 在三个基准数据集和两个复杂任务中均实现高稀疏度且性能损失最小，在所有事件流数据集上取得最佳实验结果，突触信息传递效率随稀疏度增加而显著提升

Conclusion: 神经元树突的复杂结构和非线性计算为开发高效SNN方法提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on
simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent
artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons
have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however,
the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites.
Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal
dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with
nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we
introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation
of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state
transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible
nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We
conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture,
CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks
(speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task).
Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal
performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best
experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis
showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information
transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a
promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

Method: 将滤波器设计建模为顺序决策过程，使用强化学习代理设计信号特定的滤波器序列，保持完全可解释性。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的真实ECG数据集上实现了最先进的R峰检测和生理状态分类性能。

Conclusion: SMF框架具有可靠且可解释的临床决策支持潜力，可扩展到需要从噪声污染信号中准确定位模式的广泛应用。

Abstract: Matched filters are widely used to localise signal patterns due to their high
efficiency and interpretability. However, their effectiveness deteriorates for
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals, such as those recorded on edge
devices, where prominent noise patterns can closely resemble the target within
the limited length of the filter. One example is the ear-electrocardiogram
(ear-ECG), where the cardiac signal is attenuated and heavily corrupted by
artefacts. To address this, we propose the Sequential Matched Filter (SMF), a
paradigm that replaces the conventional single matched filter with a sequence
of filters designed by a Reinforcement Learning agent. By formulating filter
design as a sequential decision-making process, SMF adaptively design
signal-specific filter sequences that remain fully interpretable by revealing
key patterns driving the decision-making. The proposed SMF framework has strong
potential for reliable and interpretable clinical decision support, as
demonstrated by its state-of-the-art R-peak detection and physiological state
classification performance on two challenging real-world ECG datasets. The
proposed formulation can also be extended to a broad range of applications that
require accurate pattern localisation from noise-corrupted signals.

TL;DR: Miffie是一个基于大语言模型的数据库自动化规范化框架，通过双模型自优化架构实现高精度、无需人工干预的数据库规范化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据库规范化对保持数据完整性至关重要，但传统手动操作耗时且容易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用双模型自优化架构：生成模块负责消除异常，验证模块提供反馈，通过零样本提示设计确保高精度和成本效益。

Result: 实验结果表明Miffie能够规范化复杂数据库模式，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: Miffie框架成功实现了自动化数据库规范化，解决了传统手动方法的效率和质量问题。

Abstract: Database normalization is crucial to preserving data integrity. However, it
is time-consuming and error-prone, as it is typically performed manually by
data engineers. To this end, we present Miffie, a database normalization
framework that leverages the capability of large language models. Miffie
enables automated data normalization without human effort while preserving high
accuracy. The core of Miffie is a dual-model self-refinement architecture that
combines the best-performing models for normalized schema generation and
verification, respectively. The generation module eliminates anomalies based on
the feedback of the verification module until the output schema satisfies the
requirement for normalization. We also carefully design task-specific zero-shot
prompts to guide the models for achieving both high accuracy and cost
efficiency. Experimental results show that Miffie can normalize complex
database schemas while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种融合机器学习预测的改进版零维模型(RRI)，通过预测分叉系数来提高血流动力学模拟的准确性，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的3D有限元模拟计算成本高，而降维模型(ROMs)在血管分叉处准确性不足，特别是处理复杂流动物理时。

Method: 开发了电阻-电阻-电感(RRI)模型，使用神经网络根据分叉几何形状预测压力-流量关系，包括线性和二次电阻以及电感效应。采用无维化技术减少训练数据需求。

Result: 在集中分叉和血管树中验证，RRI方法将入口压力误差从标准0D模型的54 mmHg(45%)降低到25 mmHg(17%)，RI变体达到31 mmHg(26%)误差。

Conclusion: 这种混合数值方法能够实现准确的实时血流动力学模拟，为临床应用、不确定性量化和数字双胞蕴提供支持。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) finite-element simulations of cardiovascular flows
provide high-fidelity predictions to support cardiovascular medicine, but their
high computational cost limits clinical practicality. Reduced-order models
(ROMs) offer computationally efficient alternatives but suffer reduced
accuracy, particularly at vessel bifurcations where complex flow physics are
inadequately captured by standard Poiseuille flow assumptions. We present an
enhanced numerical framework that integrates machine learning-predicted
bifurcation coefficients into zero-dimensional (0D) hemodynamic ROMs to improve
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We develop a
resistor-resistor-inductor (RRI) model that uses neural networks to predict
pressure-flow relationships from bifurcation geometry, incorporating linear and
quadratic resistances along with inductive effects. The method employs
non-dimensionalization to reduce training data requirements and apriori flow
split prediction for improved bifurcation characterization. We incorporate the
RRI model into a 0D model using an optimization-based solution strategy. We
validate the approach in isolated bifurcations and vascular trees, across
Reynolds numbers from 0 to 5,500, defining ROM accuracy by comparison to 3D
finite element simulation. Results demonstrate substantial accuracy
improvements: averaged across all trees and Reynolds numbers, the RRI method
reduces inlet pressure errors from 54 mmHg (45%) for standard 0D models to 25
mmHg (17%), while a simplified resistor-inductor (RI) variant achieves 31 mmHg
(26%) error. The enhanced 0D models show particular effectiveness at high
Reynolds numbers and in extensive vascular networks. This hybrid numerical
approach enables accurate, real-time hemodynamic modeling for clinical decision
support, uncertainty quantification, and digital twins in cardiovascular
biomedical engineering.

*Abhijit Sinha,Hemant Kumar Kathania,Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本研究探索了自盛学习预训练模型在儿童语音识别中的层级特征效果，发现Wav2Vec2模型的第22层能在零样本场景下将词误率相对提升51.64%，显著提升儿童语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音具有独特的声学和语言特征，传统语音识别系统在处理儿童语音时表现差强。虽然自盛学习模型在成人语音识别中取得了重大进步，但在儿童语音识别中仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 研究使用Wav2Vec2、HuBERT、Data2Vec和WavLM等预训练模型提取层级特征，并将其集成到Kaldi工具集的简化DNN-ASR系统中。在零样本场景下，使用WSJCAM0成人语音训练，使用PFSTAR儿童语音测试。

Result: Wav2Vec2模型第22层实现了最低词误率5.15%，相比于直接零样本解码的WER 10.65%，相对提升51.64%。年龄分析显示性能随着年龄增长而一致提升，广泛实验验证了方法的普遍性。

Conclusion: 通过选择适当的自盛学习模型层级特征，可以在零样本场景下显著提升儿童语音识别性能，为儿童语音识别领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately
process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and
linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech,
accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This
study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from
state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT,
Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech
in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these
models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system
using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for
enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where
WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for
testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model
achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64%
relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of
10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent
performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains
observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments
on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the
generalizability of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自监督学习(SSL)模型的零样本关键词检测方法，专门应用于儿童语音。使用成人语音训练的模型在儿童语音上达到了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管成人语音的关键词检测已有许多方法，但儿童语音具有独特的声学和语言特征，对KWS系统构成特殊挑战。需要一种能够在没有儿童语音训练数据的情况下有效处理儿童语音的方法。

Method: 提出了一种零样本KWS方法，利用Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Data2Vec等先进自监督学习模型。从这些SSL模型中分层提取特征，然后训练Kaldi基于DNN的KWS系统。使用WSJCAM0成人语音数据集训练，在PFSTAR儿童语音数据集上测试。

Result: 在儿童语音上达到了最优性能，Wav2Vec2模型的第22层表现最佳：ATWV得分0.691，MTWV得分0.7003，误报概率0.0164，漏报概率0.0547。在噪声条件下也显示出显著改善，并在不同年龄段儿童中都有效。

Conclusion: SSL特征对提升儿童语音的零样本关键词检测性能做出了重要贡献，有效解决了儿童语音特有挑战。该方法为处理儿童语音的KWS系统提供了一种强大且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in
adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems
due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper
introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art
self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec.
Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a
Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for
training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing,
demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved
state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech.
Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best,
delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of
false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a
set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed
the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess
the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted
using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The
results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based
baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions.
To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an
additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant
contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for
children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the
distinct characteristics of child speakers.

### [192] [Adapting to Change: A Comparison of Continual and Transfer Learning for Modeling Building Thermal Dynamics under Concept Drifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21615)
*Fabian Raisch,Max Langtry,Felix Koch,Ruchi Choudhary,Christoph Goebel,Benjamin Tischler*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling
building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a
pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it
remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational
measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more
complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit
or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning
(CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can
also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step
and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to
incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and
address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building
thermal dynamics is still missing.
  Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a
model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building
operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data
representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios
with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL
strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements
than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort.
SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1\% without concept
drifts and 34.9\% with concept drifts.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: DynaMark是一个基于强化学习的动态水印框架，通过马尔可夫决策过程自适应调整高斯水印协方差，有效防御工业4.0机床控制器的重放攻击，在保持控制性能的同时显著降低水印能量消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0中高度网络化的机床控制器容易受到重放攻击，现有动态水印方案假设线性高斯动态并使用恒定水印统计，无法适应机床控制器时变且部分专有的行为特性。

Method: 提出DynaMark强化学习框架，将动态水印建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在线学习自适应策略，动态调整零均值高斯水印的协方差，无需系统知识。开发贝叶斯置信更新机制实现实时检测置信度。

Result: 在西门子Sinumerik 828D控制器数字孪生上，相比恒定方差基线，水印能量降低70%同时保持标称轨迹，平均检测延迟相当于一个采样间隔。物理步进电机测试台验证了这些发现。

Conclusion: DynaMark框架有效解决了现有动态水印方案的局限性，在工业控制系统中实现了高效的重放攻击检测，在控制性能、能耗和检测置信度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime
targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate
actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes
assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making
them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We
close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models
dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive
policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian
watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing
system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control
performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We
develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence
in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions,
underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D
controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by
70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance
baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one
sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,
rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding
existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: CrossTL是一个通用的编程语言翻译器，通过统一的中间表示CrossGL实现多种语言间的双向翻译，支持CUDA、HIP、Metal、HLSL、GLSL、SPIR-V、Rust和Mojo等多种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每对语言单独开发翻译器，导致复杂度呈指数级增长。CrossTL旨在通过统一的中间表示解决这一问题，实现语言无关的编程。

Method: 系统包含语言特定的词法分析器/解析器将源代码转换为AST，双向CrossGL翻译模块（ToCrossGLConverter导入和CodeGen目标生成），以及处理完整翻译流程的后端实现。

Result: 通过跨编程领域的全面评估，在所有支持的后端上实现了成功的编译和执行，证明了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: CrossTL代表了向语言无关编程迈出的重要一步，实现了"编写一次，随处部署"的开发模式，统一的IR设计使得添加新语言只需最少的努力。

Abstract: We present CrossTL, a universal programming language translator enabling
bidirectional translation between multiple languages through a unified
intermediate representation called CrossGL. Traditional approaches require
separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity
growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between
CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,
with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific
lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL
translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code
and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend
implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate
effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,
achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.
The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,
requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions
include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming
paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a
comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and
systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical
viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step
toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere
development.

TL;DR: 本文对19种最先进的通用机器学习原子间势能(uMLIPs)进行了全面的解理能预测基准测试，发现训练数据组成比架构复杂度更重要，使用包含非平衡构型的OMat24数据集训练的模型性能最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习原子间势能在预测体相性质方面取得了显著成功，但缺乏对这些通用模型在解理能预测方面的系统性评估，而解理能是控制断裂、催化和表面稳定性的关键性质。

Method: 使用包含36,718个板状结构的DFT数据库，对19种最先进的uMLIPs进行基准测试，评估不同架构范式在化学成分、晶体系统、厚度和表面取向方面的性能。

Result: OMat24数据集训练的模型平均绝对百分比误差低于6%，在87%的情况下正确识别热力学最稳定表面终止，而仅使用平衡数据集训练的模型误差高出5倍，表面吸附数据训练的模型性能下降17倍。简单架构在适当数据下可获得与复杂transformer相当的精度，同时提供10-100倍计算加速。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，社区应专注于生成能够捕捉相关物理现象的战略性训练数据，而非过度追求架构复杂性。

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据同化应用中特别有前景，因为其在短提前期具有高准确性，为集合预报提供了有效的参数化学习框架

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of trajectory learning for ensemble
forecasts by employing the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) as a loss
function. Using the two-scale Lorenz '96 system as a case study, we develop and
train both additive and multiplicative stochastic parametrizations to generate
ensemble predictions. Results indicate that CRPS-based trajectory learning
produces parametrizations that are both accurate and sharp. The resulting
parametrizations are straightforward to calibrate and outperform
derivative-fitting-based parametrizations in short-term forecasts. This
approach is particularly promising for data assimilation applications due to
its accuracy over short lead times.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code
transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum
and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches
can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the
heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate
one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances
of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called
Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG
pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub
repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can
improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and
consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond
this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to
address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying
software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG
pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance,
for transpilation use cases.

Motivation: 单元测试是编程中的核心实践，但编写全面的测试面临挑战。LLM已用于自动测试生成，但训练LLM生成高质量测试的方法仍然不足。

Method: 提出UTR框架，通过强化学习迭代训绂两个LLM（测试生成器和代码生成器）。测试生成器最大化辨别奖励（曝露代码错误），代码生成器最大化代码奖励（通过测试）。

Result: UTR训练的Qwen3-4B生成的测试质量高于监督学习的同模型，代码评估更接近真实测试的结果，甚至超过GPT-4.1等前沿模型。

Conclusion: UTR框架通过对抗性学习方式有效地训练LLM生成高质量单元测试，为自动测试生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic
evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models
(LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have
been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to
produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,
a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate
high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to
iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in
an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is
trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to
produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the
code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability
to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B
trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the
same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth
unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those
induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL
outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit
tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

TL;DR: 在SWE-agent任务中，简单的观察掩码策略比复杂的LLM摘要方法成本减半且性能相当，甚至略有提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理复杂任务时会产生冗长的上下文历史，现有软件工程代理使用LLM摘要来解决此问题，但需要验证这种复杂方法是否真的比简单策略更有效

Method: 在SWE-agent上对SWE-bench Verified进行系统比较，测试五种不同模型配置下的原始代理、观察掩码和LLM摘要三种策略

Result: 观察掩码策略将成本减半，同时解决率与LLM摘要相当甚至略高（如Qwen3-Coder 480B从53.8%提升到54.8%）

Conclusion: 在SWE-agent环境中，最简单有效的上下文管理策略可能就是最简单的观察掩码方法，而非复杂的LLM摘要

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative
reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long,
expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE)
agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this
issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible
performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present
a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench
Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple
observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while
matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM
summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate
from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization
at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on
SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be
the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

TL;DR: Locus是一个新颖的定向模糊测试框架，通过合成语义中间状态谓词来指导模糊测试，显著提高了漏洞发现的效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的定向模糊测试方法依赖分支距离或手动指定的约束，这些方法往往无法精确描述向目标状态的进展，且难以泛化到不同的目标状态和程序

Method: Locus采用代理框架和程序分析工具来自动合成和迭代优化候选谓词，这些谓词捕获模糊测试进展作为语义上有意义的中间状态，同时通过符号执行确保谓词严格放宽目标状态以防止错误拒绝

Result: Locus显著提高了八种最先进模糊测试器发现真实世界漏洞的效率，平均加速比达到41.6倍，并发现了八个先前未修补的漏洞

Conclusion: Locus框架通过自动化合成语义中间状态谓词，有效解决了定向模糊测试中的搜索效率问题，为漏洞发现提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target
program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes,
confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential
vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are
often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by
numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches
rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search;
however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize
progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified
constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to
generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed
fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing
progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones
towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under
fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while
providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to
diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis
tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while
ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false
rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus
substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in
discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x.
So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already
acknowledged with a draft patch.

*Guofu Liao,Taotao Wang,Shengli Zhang,Jiqun Zhang,Shi Long,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: zkLoRA是首个将LoRA微调与零知识证明结合的安全框架，通过密码学技术验证Transformer架构中的算术和非算术操作，实现端到端的可验证性，保护模型参数和训练数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型微调计算成本高，且在不可信环境中存在正确性和隐私问题。虽然LoRA等参数高效方法减少了资源需求，但在零知识约束下确保微调的安全性和可验证性仍是一个未解决的挑战。

Method: zkLoRA采用高级密码学技术（查找参数、和校验协议、多项式承诺）来验证基于Transformer架构中的算术和非算术操作。该框架为LoRA微调中的前向传播、反向传播和参数更新提供端到端可验证性。

Result: 通过基于GPU的实现，zkLoRA在开源LLM（如LLaMA）上进行了实验验证，展示了实用性和效率，可扩展到130亿参数。

Conclusion: zkLoRA通过将参数高效微调与零知识证明相结合，填补了关键空白，使得大语言模型能够在敏感或不可信环境中实现安全可信的部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to
specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns
about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although
parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly
reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of
fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge.
To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA
fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and
correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup
arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both
arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures.
The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation,
backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while
safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging
GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency
through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to
13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs,
zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of
LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

Abstract: Model stealing attacks endanger the confidentiality of machine learning
models offered as a service. Although these models are kept secret, a malicious
party can query a model to label data samples and train their own substitute
model, violating intellectual property. While novel attacks in the field are
continually being published, their design and evaluations are not standardised,
making it challenging to compare prior works and assess progress in the field.
This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for
designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the
largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those
attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive
threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse
attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been
studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack
development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list
of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks.
Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence
establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing
attacks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OptMark是一种基于优化的扩散模型水印方法，通过在去噪过程的中间潜在空间中嵌入结构性和细节性水印，实现鲁棒的多比特水印嵌入，同时使用伴随梯度方法将内存消耗从O(N)降低到O(1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散水印方法存在局限性：零比特水印缺乏大规模用户追踪能力，而多比特方法对图像变换或生成攻击高度敏感，缺乏全面的鲁棒性。

Method: 在扩散去噪过程的中间潜在空间中嵌入鲁棒多比特水印，早期插入结构性水印抵抗生成攻击，晚期插入细节性水印抵抗图像变换，并使用定制正则化项保持图像质量和不可感知性。采用伴随梯度方法解决优化过程中内存消耗线性增长问题。

Result: 实验结果表明OptMark实现了不可见的多比特水印，同时对值度变换、几何变换、编辑和再生攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OptMark提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了当前扩散水印方法的局限性，实现了鲁棒且不可感知的多比特水印嵌入。

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection
and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face
significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for
large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to
certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of
comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an
optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the
intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically
inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail
watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization
terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the
challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising
steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods,
reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that
OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust
resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations,
editing, and regeneration attacks.

TL;DR: QuadKAN：基于样条参数化和KAN网络的视觉引导四足运动控制框架，结合本体感觉与视觉，通过结构化函数类提升样本效率、减少动作抖动和能耗，在多种地形上优于SOTA方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉引导四足运动控制问题，强调结合本体感觉与视觉对于鲁棒控制的必要性，传统方法在处理步态的片段平滑特性时存在效率不足和动作抖动问题

Method: 提出QuadKAN框架：使用样条参数化的跨模态策略，基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks；包含样条编码器处理本体感觉，样条融合头处理本体感觉-视觉输入；采用多模态延迟随机化和PPO进行端到端训练

Result: 在包括平坦/不平坦地形、静态/动态障碍物等多种场景评估中，QuadKAN相比SOTA基线获得更高回报、更远距离、更少碰撞，表现出更好的鲁棒性和性能

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒视觉引导运动控制提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案，结构化函数类能够更好地对齐状态-动作映射与步态的片段平滑特性

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

Conclusion: 该方法通过最优传输理论有效解决了多机器人路径规划中的冲突问题，结合模型预测控制增强了动态环境适应性，为多机器人系统提供了实用的导航解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在代码生成和推理方面表现出色，但在机器人操作策略代码生成中仍存在不可靠性问题，不同用户对同一任务的不同指令会导致策略代码生成失败。

Method: 设计RoboInspector管道，从任务复杂性和指令粒度两个维度分析策略代码不可靠性，在两大框架中进行168种任务-指令-LLM组合实验，识别四种主要不可靠行为。

Result: 识别出导致操作失败的四种主要不可靠行为，并详细分析了这些行为的根本原因。通过基于失败策略代码反馈的优化方法，在仿真和真实环境中将策略代码生成的可靠性提升高达35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector有效揭示了LLM在机器人操作策略代码生成中的不可靠性问题，提出的优化方法显著提升了可靠性，为实际开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

our approach on challenging unregistered meshes.

Conclusion: 两种正则化策略有效地改善了单个高斯元素的保真度和整体表面行为，提高了3D网格重建的质量

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes and visuals from 3D Gaussian
Splatting(3DGS) still remains a central challenge in computer graphics.
Although existing models such as SuGaR offer effective solutions for rendering,
there is is still room to improve improve both visual fidelity and scene
consistency. This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary
regularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of
individual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first
strategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent
studies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages
extreme anisotropy-specifically, "needle-like" shapes-by favoring more
balanced, "disk-like" forms that are better suited for stable surface
reconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance
Function (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an
Eikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous
global surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the
underlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity
of individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior. The
final model can make more accurate and coherent visuals from 3DGS data.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity
classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study
applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation
and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from
963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare
affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had
clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6
board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural
network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify
disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select
the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated
using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU
ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and
acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive
metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy
Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification
(normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class
setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1%
of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and
computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced
labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss
effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance,
maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

### [213] [WaveLLDM: Design and Development of a Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model for Speech Enhancement and Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21153)
*Kevin Putra Santoso,Rizka Wakhidatus Sholikah,Raden Venantius Hari Ginardi*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WaveLLDM是一个轻量级潜在扩散模型，通过神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散的结合，在压缩潜在空间中处理音频，降低了计算复杂度但保持了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量音频在多种应用中至关重要，但噪声、压缩和传输伪影导致的音频退化仍是主要挑战。传统扩散模型需要大量计算资源且难以处理较长的缺失片段。

Method: 提出WaveLLDM架构，将高效的神经音频编解码器与潜在扩散相结合，在压缩潜在空间中进行音频修复和去噪，而不是在时间或频谱域中操作。

Result: 在Voicebank+DEMAND测试集上，WaveLLDM实现了较低的Log-Spectral Distance分数（0.48-0.60）和良好的未见数据适应性，但在感知质量和语音清晰度方面（WB-PESQ: 1.62-1.71, STOI: 0.76-0.78）仍落后于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 尽管存在架构调优不足、缺乏微调和训练时间不足等限制，但结合神经音频编解码器和潜在扩散模型的灵活架构为未来发展提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including
online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,
degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a
major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio
restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and
struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM
(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an
efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and
denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral
domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing
computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical
evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves
accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores
(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still
underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual
quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and
STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to
suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient
training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a
neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for
future development.

*Aditya Makineni,Baocheng Geng,Qing Tian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了FFTP全频段时间分块策略和SpecMask数据增强方法，显著提升音频分类性能并大幅降低计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频分类模型采用计算机视觉中的方形分块方法，破坏了频谱图的连续频率模式，产生过多分块导致训练缓慢和计算量增加

Method: FFTP分块策略：跨全频段但局部时间上下文的分块方式，匹配频谱图的时间-频率不对称性；SpecMask增强：结合全频段和局部时频掩码的补丁对齐频谱图增强方法

Result: 在AST和AuM模型上应用，AudioSet-18k上mAP提升最高+6.76，SpeechCommandsV2上准确率提升最高+8.46，计算量减少最高83.26%

Conclusion: FFTP和SpecMask方法在保持频谱连续性的同时显著提升了音频分类性能并大幅降低了计算成本，证明了性能和效率的双重提升

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification
by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such
as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square
patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and
produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing
computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching
strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by
spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving
harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We
also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines
full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,
enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When
applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by
up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,
while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and
efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 开发了一种利用合成音频数据预训练、小样本微调的结构振动传感器系统，用于远程监测独居痴呆患者的日常活动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决独居痴呆患者远程监护中的隐私保护、活动识别和模型泛化问题，减少护理负担

Method: 使用近表面声学音频合成数据预训练模型，然后通过极有限的标注数据进行微调，构建结构振动传感器系统

Result: 创建了一个可扩展的鲁棒框架，能够在用户家中部署时仅需少量标注数据即可实现准确的日常活动跟踪

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有远程监护系统在真实环境中部署时所需大量标注数据的问题，为独居痴呆患者的远程护理提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: One in four people dementia live alone, leading family members to take on
caregiving roles from a distance. Many researchers have developed remote
monitoring solutions to lessen caregiving needs; however, limitations remain
including privacy preserving solutions, activity recognition, and model
generalizability to new users and environments. Structural vibration sensor
systems are unobtrusive solutions that have been proven to accurately monitor
human information, such as identification and activity recognition, in
controlled settings by sensing surface vibrations generated by activities.
However, when deploying in an end user's home, current solutions require a
substantial amount of labeled data for accurate activity recognition. Our
scalable solution adapts synthesized data from near-surface acoustic audio to
pretrain a model and allows fine tuning with very limited data in order to
create a robust framework for daily routine tracking.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 通过双分辨率注意力统计池化机制，结合全局统计摘要和细粒度分析，显著提升语音质量平均意见分数预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有池化方法仅关注单一粒度（全局或帧级），忽视了补充的感知视角，需要更全面的表征编码方法

Method: 提出双分辨率注意力统计池化(DRASP)框架，整合粗粒度全局统计摘要和细粒度感知显著段落的注意力分析

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上均显著超过基线方法，系统级SRCC相对提升10.39%，具有强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: 双视角架构能够同时捐捕整体结构上下文和显著局部细节，为语音质量预测提供更全面和稳健的表征

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction,
facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a
concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality.
Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity,
concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed
frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics
Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global
statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually
significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to
formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the
overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization
ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline
methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction
backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different
audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in
system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the
widely-used average pooling approach.

TL;DR: 巴西儿童使用对话代理的研究，通过结构化支架提升互动效果，发现食谱式提示方法在可读性、问题深度和连贯性方面优于非结构化基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究巴西9-11岁儿童如何使用对话代理进行学习、探索和娱乐，以及如何通过结构化支架来增强这些互动体验

Method: 研究1：对23名参与者进行7周在线调查，使用访谈、观察和认知工作分析；研究2：使用GPT-4o-mini在1200个模拟儿童-对话代理交流上进行结构化提示与非结构化基线的比较

Result: 识别出对话代理的三个功能：学校、探索、娱乐；食谱式支架方法在可读性、问题数量/深度/多样性和连贯性方面显示出优势

Conclusion: 提出设计建议：支架式对话树、儿童专用配置文件、看护人策划内容；贡献包括首个巴西儿童的CWA应用、儿童-对话代理信息流框架和LLM支架食谱方法

Abstract: This paper presents two studies on how Brazilian children (ages 9--11) use
conversational agents (CAs) for schoolwork, discovery, and entertainment, and
how structured scaffolds can enhance these interactions. In Study 1, a
seven-week online investigation with 23 participants (children, parents,
teachers) employed interviews, observations, and Cognitive Work Analysis to map
children's information-processing flows, the role of more knowledgeable others,
functional uses, contextual goals, and interaction patterns to inform
conversation-tree design. We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery,
Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support.
In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges,
comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an
unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question
count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach.
Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded
conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and
caregiver-curated content. Our contributions include the first CWA application
with Brazilian children, an empirical framework of child-CA information flows,
and an LLM-scaffolding ``recipe'' (i.e., structured-prompting) for effective,
scaffolded learning.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Morae是一个UI代理系统，通过识别任务执行中的决策点并暂停让用户选择，提高了盲人和低视力用户在使用界面代理时的自主权和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI代理通常端到端执行任务而不让用户参与关键选择，减少了用户自主权。研究发现BLV用户需要更多参与决策过程来满足个人偏好。

Method: Morae使用大型多模态模型解析用户查询、UI代码和截图，在需要决策时暂停并提示用户澄清选择。采用混合主动方法，结合自动化和用户偏好表达。

Result: 在真实网页任务研究中，与基线代理（包括OpenAI Operator）相比，Morae帮助用户完成更多任务，并选择更符合偏好的选项。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了混合主动方法的有效性，用户既能受益于UI代理的自动化，又能表达个人偏好，提高了BLV用户的界面可访问性和使用体验。

Abstract: User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier
to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents
typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices
or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user
agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the
cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from
several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with
different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce
Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task
execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large
multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,
and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a
study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users
complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,
as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this
work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the
automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.

TL;DR: 研究通过20位AI计算机感知工具开发者的深度访谈，识别出4个关键设计优先级：上下文考虑与可解释性、临床工作流对齐、利益相关者定制化、创新与范式平衡，强调开发者作为技术架构师和伦理管家的双重角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI计算机感知技术使用移动传感器收集行为生理数据支持临床决策，但如何平衡临床效用与用户接受度/可信度是有效整合到临床工作流的关键挑战。

Method: 对20位AI计算机感知工具开发者进行深度访谈，采用归纳式主题分析方法识别关键设计优先级。

Result: 识别出4个核心设计优先级：1)考虑上下文并确保对患者和临床医生的可解释性；2)与现有临床工作流对齐；3)为相关利益相关者适当定制以提高可用性和接受度；4)在创新突破与既定范式间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 开发者需要作为技术架构师和伦理管家的双重角色，通过记录定制化选择、定义定制限制、透明传达输出信息、投资用户培训等方式实现平衡，需要开发者、临床医生和伦理学家之间的跨学科合作。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use
mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical
decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated
and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical
workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user
acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth
interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed
and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design
priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both
patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3)
appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and
acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with
established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves
as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools
that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing
objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following
suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around
customization are made, defining limits for customization choices,
transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user
training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration
between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

TL;DR: 量子文本生成模型与传统Transformer架构的对比评估，显示传统模型整体更优但量子模型在特定场景下具有竞争力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算在自然语言处理中的应用日益增长，需要系统评估量子文本生成模型与传统架构的性能差异

Method: 使用五个不同数据集（简单句子、短故事、量子短语、俳句诗歌、谚语），比较Transformer、QKSAN、QRWKV、QASA五种模型，采用困惑度、BLEU分数、词汇多样性、重复率、流畅度等多指标评估

Result: 传统Transformer模型整体最优（平均困惑度1.21，BLEU-1得分0.2895），但量子模型在特定场景表现优异：QKSAN获得0.2800 BLEU-1得分且零重复率，QRWKV在某些任务中实现完美词汇多样性

Conclusion: 量子文本生成模型虽然整体不如传统Transformer，但在特定指标和场景下展现出竞争力，为量子计算在NLP领域的应用提供了有希望的探索方向

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.

Conclusion: 展示了AI驱动学习与量子计算的协同效应，证明智能体能够自主发现用于增强传感和估计任务的最优量子电路设计

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits
(QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates
computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for
learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection
mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current
state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions.
Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing
the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that
maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of
gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated
generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with
high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of
the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S
gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1.
This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum
computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover
optimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing quantum
circuits for specific tasks is crucial for enhancing performance and
efficiency. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly
growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology.
The field is expected to provide new opportunities, especially regarding high
sensitivity and precision. Entanglement is one of the key factors in achieving
high sensitivity and measurement precision [3]. This paper presents a novel
approach utilizing quantum machine learning techniques to optimize entanglement
distribution in quantum sensor circuits. By leveraging reinforcement learning
within a quantum environment, we aim to optimize the entanglement layout to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy, which are
key indicators of a quantum system's sensitivity and coherence, while
minimizing circuit depth and gate counts. Our implementation, based on Qiskit,
integrates noise models and error mitigation strategies to simulate realistic
quantum environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in
circuit performance and sensitivity, highlighting the potential of machine
learning in quantum circuit optimization by measuring high QFI and entropy in
the range of 0.84-1.0 with depth and gate count reduction by 20-86%.

Conclusion: 结合量子机器学习和张量网络的方法在现实约束下优化复杂量子电路具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing
and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing
these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in
large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and
efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering
integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation
(MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits
with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt
tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS)
representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix
approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to
maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while
reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent
improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the
0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results
highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor
networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了流行病学研究中治疗决策时间信息性问题，提出了使用g-方法调整治疗间隔时间作为时变混杂因素来解决偏倚问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流行病学研究经常需要估计序列治疗决策对生存结果的影响，但治疗时间在不同受试者间存在差异，这种时间信息性可能影响后续治疗决策和潜在结果，而现有文献对此问题认识不足

Method: 使用g-方法来分析具有信息性时间的序列治疗，将治疗间隔时间视为时变混杂因素进行调整，通过合成示例说明调整方法，并比较离散时间与连续时间模型的识别问题

Result: 研究表明，不调整治疗间隔时间的g-方法可能存在偏倚，而通过将等待时间作为时变混杂因素进行调整可以有效解决信息性时间问题

Conclusion: 考虑治疗时间信息性对于有效推断至关重要，使用g-方法调整治疗间隔时间作为时变混杂因素可以校正信息性时间问题

Abstract: Epidemiological studies are often concerned with estimating causal effects of
a sequence of treatment decisions on survival outcomes. In many settings,
treatment decisions do not occur at fixed, pre-specified followup times.
Rather, timing varies across subjects in ways that may be informative of
subsequent treatment decisions and potential outcomes. Awareness of the issue
and its potential solutions is lacking in the literature, which motivate this
work. Here, we formalize the issue of informative timing, problems associated
with ignoring it, and show how g-methods can be used to analyze sequential
treatments that are informatively timed. As we describe, in such settings, the
waiting times between successive treatment decisions may be properly viewed as
a time-varying confounders. Using synthetic examples, we illustrate how
g-methods that do not adjust for these waiting times may be biased and how
adjustment can be done in scenarios where patients may die or be censored in
between treatments. We draw connections between adjustment and identification
with discrete-time versus continuous-time models. Finally, we provide
implementation guidance and examples using publicly available software. Our
concluding message is that 1) considering timing is important for valid
inference and 2) correcting for informative timing can be done with g-methods
that adjust for waiting times between treatments as time-varying confounders.

TL;DR: Pep2Prob是首个用于肽特异性片段离子概率预测的综合数据集和基准，通过机器学习方法显著优于传统基于全局统计的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前质谱分析中肽片段离子概率预测依赖于全局统计假设，忽略了肽特异性差异，限制了预测准确性。需要建立肽特异性的预测方法来提高蛋白质鉴定的精确度。

Method: 构建包含608,780个独特前体的数据集，从1.83亿个高质量HCD MS²光谱中总结片段离子概率统计。使用统计规则和基于学习的方法建立基线性能，比较肽特异性信息与全局统计方法的差异。

Result: 利用肽特异性信息的模型显著优于仅使用全局碎片统计的先前方法。基准模型性能随容量增加而提升，表明肽-碎片关系存在复杂的非线性，需要先进的机器学习方法。

Conclusion: Pep2Prob数据集为肽特异性片段离子概率预测提供了重要资源，证明了肽特异性方法在提高质谱分析准确性方面的优势，为未来开发更复杂的机器学习模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug
targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in
health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical
technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting
them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in
biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability
prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide
identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information.
Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes
that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless,
this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view
and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the
first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific
fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion
probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair
of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million
high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide
assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance
using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models
leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous
methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance
across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the
peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring
sophisticated machine learning approaches.

TL;DR: 利用荷兰人口登记数据构建社交网络嵌入，预测右翼民粹主义投票行为，发现教育相关的网络结构差异与投票选择相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用人口规模的登记数据构建社交网络嵌入，评估这些嵌入在预测政治行为（如右翼民粹主义投票）方面的信息价值

Method: 基于荷兰人口数据构建包含邻里、工作、家庭、住户和学校五个共享情境的网络，生成网络嵌入表示，使用机器学习方法预测右翼民粹主义投票，并对嵌入进行稀疏化和正交化处理以提高可解释性

Result: 嵌入单独预测右翼民粹主义投票的效果优于随机水平但不如个体特征；结合最佳嵌入子集与个体特征仅略微改善预测；经过变换后的一个嵌入维度与结果强烈相关，揭示了不同学校联系和受教育水平在网络结构上的差异

Conclusion: 方法学上证明了如何使人口规模网络嵌入可解释，实质上揭示了教育相关的网络结构差异与右翼民粹主义投票之间的关联

Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale
networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With
machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations
-- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the
network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a
population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood,
work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these
embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings
alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed
worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings
with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. However,
after transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and
orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with
the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed
differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between
different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes
methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can
be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network
differences in education to right-wing populist voting.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于矩阵分解的启发式方法，用于在图上添加2-cells来构建cell complex，使得观察到的边流信号能够被Hodge拉普拉斯算子的特征向量稀疏表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在图上观察到的边流信号的稀疏表示问题，通过构建cell complex来获得可解释的梯度流和旋度流表示。由于该问题已被证明是NP难的，需要开发高效的启发式算法。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的基于矩阵分解的启发式方法，通过添加2-cells（由闭合、非相交路径环绕的多边形）来增强观察图，构建cell complex。

Result: 计算实验表明，新方法在计算成本上显著低于先前启发式方法，在大多数设置下性能仅略差。在特定噪声设置下，新方法在解质量和计算速度上都优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的矩阵分解启发式方法为边流信号的稀疏表示提供了一种计算高效且在某些情况下性能更优的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the following inference problem: Given a set of edge-flow signals
observed on a graph, lift the graph to a cell complex, such that the observed
edge-flow signals can be represented as a sparse combination of gradient and
curl flows on the cell complex. Specifically, we aim to augment the observed
graph by a set of 2-cells (polygons encircled by closed, non-intersecting
paths), such that the eigenvectors of the Hodge Laplacian of the associated
cell complex provide a sparse, interpretable representation of the observed
edge flows on the graph. As it has been shown that the general problem is
NP-hard in prior work, we here develop a novel matrix-factorization-based
heuristic to solve the problem. Using computational experiments, we demonstrate
that our new approach is significantly less computationally expensive than
prior heuristics, while achieving only marginally worse performance in most
settings. In fact, we find that for specifically noisy settings, our new
approach outperforms the previous state of the art in both solution quality and
computational speed.

Main category: physics.ed-ph

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在本科热力学教学中尚未达到95%的能力阈值，最佳模型准确率仅为82%，特别是在图像推理和不可逆过程场景中表现不佳，不适合无监督辅导使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在本科科学教育中作为无监督辅导工具的可行性，热力学因其严谨的定律和微妙概念区分而成为理想测试领域。

Method: 创建了包含50个项目的本科热力学问答基准UTQA，涵盖理想气体过程、可逆性和图表解释等主题，测试了2025年领先模型的表现。

Result: 所有测试模型均未达到95%的能力阈值，最佳模型准确率为82%；文本项目表现优于图像推理任务（后者接近随机水平）；提示措辞和句法复杂度对性能影响有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在有限速率/不可逆场景以及将视觉特征与热力学含义绑定方面存在明显能力差距，尚不适合在热力学领域进行无监督辅导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in
science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate
instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent
recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics,
with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions,
reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such
capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics
question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and
diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence
threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items
performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance
levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little
correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible
scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating
that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this
domain.

Result: 成功创建了包含1730份简历的合成数据集，该数据集模拟了真实简历的特征。

Conclusion: 该合成数据集可作为算法招聘歧视研究的基准标准，有助于开发公平性评估和比较方法。

Abstract: Algorithmic hiring has become increasingly necessary in some sectors as it
promises to deal with hundreds or even thousands of applicants. At the heart of
these systems are algorithms designed to retrieve and rank candidate profiles,
which are usually represented by Curricula Vitae (CVs). Research has shown,
however, that such technologies can inadvertently introduce bias, leading to
discrimination based on factors such as candidates' age, gender, or national
origin. Developing methods to measure, mitigate, and explain bias in
algorithmic hiring, as well as to evaluate and compare fairness techniques
before deployment, requires sets of CVs that reflect the characteristics of
people from diverse backgrounds.
  However, datasets of these characteristics that can be used to conduct this
research do not exist. To address this limitation, this paper introduces an
approach for building a synthetic dataset of CVs with features modeled on real
materials collected through a data donation campaign. Additionally, the
resulting dataset of 1,730 CVs is presented, which we envision as a potential
benchmarking standard for research on algorithmic hiring discrimination.

TL;DR: 基于无人机影像和多模态大语言模型，提出了专门针对农村的宜居性评估框架，分析了中国1766个村庄的宜居性空间格局及影响因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前农村宜居性测量方法存在局限：问卷方法难以规模化，城市导向的视觉感知方法不适用于农村场景。需要开发专门针对农村的大规模宜居性评估方法

Method: 使用自上而下的方法收集大规模无人机影像，开发高效的图像比较机制（二分搜索插值），构建基于专家知识的思维链提示，从生活质量和生态宜居性两个维度评估

Result: 中国农村宜居性呈现双核-边缘空间格局（以四川和浙江为核心向外辐射递减）；政府财政支出是核心影响因素，每增加1个单位对应宜居性提升3.9-4.9个单位

Conclusion: 该方法为农村宜居性评估提供了可靠的技术框架，研究结果可为农村建设政策制定提供有价值的参考依据

Abstract: With the deepening of poverty alleviation and rural revitalization
strategies, improving the rural living environment and enhancing the quality of
life have become key priorities. Rural livability is a key indicator for
measuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches
face significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to
scale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for
rural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework
was proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a
top-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146
counties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image
comparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation
to determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.
Building on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for
nationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both
living quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced
the rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this
study characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China
and thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The
rural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,
radiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;
(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as
the core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit
enhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural
construction policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的二进制权重多比特激活(BWMA)方法，用于CIM加速器上的CNN，在保持硬件效率的同时显著提升精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用二进制权重和激活量化但精度损失大，要么使用多比特权重和激活但效率有限，需要在精度和效率之间找到更好平衡

Method: 推导每层权重量化的闭式解以提升二值化权重表示能力；开发可微分的激活量化函数来近似理想多比特函数，避免大量搜索最优设置

Conclusion: BWMA方法成功解决了CIM加速器上CNN量化中精度与效率的权衡问题，为高效神经网络部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.
