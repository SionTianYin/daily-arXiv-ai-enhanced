### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在受限环境下，通过信息补充、质量筛选和响应解析等方法提升LLM三元组生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在受限条件下（如2025 LM-KBC挑战）无法使用RAG和微调等方法时，如何提高LLM输出质量的问题

Method: 研究三元组完成任务的三个方面：生成、质量保证和LLM响应解析，分析在受限设置下的效果

Result: 发现：附加信息能提高生成质量，LLM可以有效筛选低质量三元组，响应解析的灵活性与一致性需根据具体设置进行权衡

Conclusion: 在无法使用RAG和微调的受限环境下，通过信息补充、质量筛选和核心响应解析策略可以有效提升LLM在三元组完成任务上的表现

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出AI辅助框架，利用检索增强生成技术自动化从大规模文本数据中提取企业气候政策参与证据，加速企业气候政策参与监测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业气候政策参与评估主要依赖人工，耗时耗力且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性

Method: 采用布局感知解析、Nomic嵌入模型和少样本提示策略的检索增强生成(RAG)框架，从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据

Result: 评估显示该自动化系统能有效加速证据提取，在从多语言企业文档中提取和分类证据方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 虽然自动化RAG系统能有效加速证据提取，但由于分析的复杂性，需要采用人机协作方式，技术应增强而非替代专家判断以确保准确性

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大语言模型分析文本数据的新型心理测量方法，通过上下文嵌入生成上下文分数，将文本数据转换为适合心理测量分析的形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量方法难以直接应用于文本数据，需要开发新的方法来挖掘文本中的潜在知识维度和模式，特别是在教育、心理学和法律等文本信息丰富的领域。

Method: 两阶段建模：第一阶段使用NLP技术和基于编码器的transformer模型识别关键词并生成上下文分数；第二阶段使用探索性和双因子模型等多种因子分析方法提取潜在因子。

Result: 在Wiki STEM语料库上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效发现文本数据中的潜在知识维度和模式。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了文本数据的心理测量分析能力，而且在文本信息丰富的多个领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs是一个专门用于评估葡萄牙语大语言模型性能的数据集，通过巴西谚语来测试模型对地区文化表达的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有葡萄牙语评估存在局限，主要依赖翻译数据集或结构化考试数据，无法充分捕捉语言细微差别和文化参考，需要针对特定地区的成熟评估框架。

Method: 创建BRoverbs数据集，使用巴西谚语作为评估工具，这些谚语包含文化智慧、比喻表达和复杂句法结构，能够有效挑战模型对地区表达的理解。

Result: 开发了一个专门针对巴西葡萄牙语的评估基准，可用于测试LLM在地区语言文化背景下的表现，数据集已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: BRoverbs为葡萄牙语大语言模型提供了新的区域性评估工具，有助于推进基于地区文化的基准测试发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在视觉方程求解任务中表现差强，特别是在系数计数和多步推理方面存在显著短板


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉-语言模型在需要感知与符号计算相结合的任务中的局限性，通过视觉方程求解作为研究平台

Method: 将视觉方程求解任务分解为系数计数和变量识别两个子任务，分析每个步骤的性能瓶颈

Result: 发现计数是主要瓶颈，识别与推理的组合会引入额外错误，且随着方程复杂度增加，符号推理本身也成为限制因素

Conclusion: 当前视觉-语言模型在视觉数学推理中存在关键短板，需要在计数能力和多步推理方面进行改进

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE是一个通过询问LLM是否愿意继续与用户互动的简单诊断信号，能有效区分不同用户语气下的模型偏好，为模型审计提供直接的关系信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种简单有效的诊断工具来评估大型语言模型对用户互动的持续参与意愿，补充现有的度量指标

Method: 使用3种用户语气（友好、模糊、辱骂）和10种互动刺激集，测试4个开源聊天模型在4种框架条件下的480次试验，通过YES/NO问题收集SPICE信号

Result: SPICE能清晰区分用户语气：友好互动97.5%愿意继续，辱骂互动仅17.9%愿意继续，模糊互动60.4%愿意继续。该信号与辱骂分类不同，在模型未识别辱骂时仍有81%不愿继续

Conclusion: SPICE是一个稳健、低开销且可复现的工具，可用于审计模型倾向，通过提供直接的模型状态关系信号来补充现有指标

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

### [7] [Improving LLM Safety and Helpfulness using SFT and DPO: A Study on OPT-350M](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09055)
*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这研究比较了SFT、DPO和SFT+DPO组合方法在OPT-350M模型安全性和有用性对齐上的效果，发现SFT+DPO组合方法在所有指标上都表现最佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同对齐技术（SFT、DPO和它们的组合）在提升语言模型安全性和有用性方面的效果，以构建更健壮的模型对齐流程

Method: 使用Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF数据集训练和评估四个模型（基础OPT350M、SFT模型、DPO模型、SFT+DPO模型），并采用三个关键评估指标：无害率(HmR)、有用率(HpR)和综合对齐分数(CAS)

Result: SFT表现超过DPO，但SFT+DPO组合模型在所有指标上都表现最好，证明了这些技术的互补性，同时也发现了噪声数据、GPU资源限制和训练约束等挑战

Conclusion: 研究提供了细化调整策略对模型对齐效果的全面视图，为未来建立更健壮的对齐流程奠定了基础

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MR-UIE方法，通过强化学习结合多视角推理来提升大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中的性能，特别是在复杂模式描述和多步推理场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在通用信息抽取任务中表现不足，尤其是在处理结构化输出、复杂模式描述和需要多步推理的场景时存在显著局限。

Method: 将强化学习与多视角推理相结合，使LLMs从被动抽取器转变为主动推理器，不仅能理解要抽取什么，还能理解如何进行推理。

Result: 在多个IE基准测试中，MR-UIE持续提升了跨领域的抽取准确性，并在多个数据集上超越了最先进方法。多视角推理的加入显著增强了复杂IE任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多视角推理在强化学习框架中的整合对于提升大语言模型在复杂信息抽取任务中的性能至关重要，证明了推理在挑战性场景中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

### [9] [TigerCoder: A Novel Suite of LLMs for Code Generation in Bangla](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09101)
*Nishat Raihan,Antonios Anastasopoulos,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 首个专门为孜加拉语设计的代码生成大语言模型家族，包含1B和9B模型，通过高质量数据集和评测标准提升了孜加拉语代码生成性能11-18%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第5大语言在大语言模型中表现不足，特别是在代码生成领域，主要原因是缺乏高质量训练数据

Method: 构建了完整的孜加拉语代码指令数据集，创建了MBPP-Bangla评测标准，开发了TigerCoder家族代码LLMs模型

Result: 模型在Pass@1指标上比现有多语言和通用孜加拉语LLMs提升11-18%的性能提升

Conclusion: 精心编译的高质量数据集可以克服小型模型在低资源语言中的限制，所有资源已开源以促进孜加拉语LLM研究发展

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3是一个245B参数的垂直领域MoE模型，专为东南亚电商设计，在电商任务上超越GPT-4等主流模型，支持多语言并在Shopee平台广泛应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型在需要领域专业知识的专门任务上表现不佳，电商领域数据嘈杂、异构、多语言且高度动态，需要专门的解决方案。

Method: 采用更少但更大的专家模型，结合硬件优化（节点内专家并行和定制memcpy操作符），在12T多语言语料和合成电商指令上训练，提出OTPO方法增强对齐。

Result: 在电商性能上达到SOTA，超越DeepSeek-V3.1、GPT-4系列和Qwen3-235B，在东南亚低资源语言和葡萄牙语上表现强劲，在Shopee平台已替代70%以上OpenAI流量。

Conclusion: Compass-v3在电商专业知识和多语言能力方面具有双重优势，已成功应用于工业级电商平台，证明了垂直领域专业化模型的价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

### [11] [Automated Classification of Tutors' Dialogue Acts Using Generative AI: A Case Study Using the CIMA Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09125)
*Liqun He,Jiaqi Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4自动分类教育对话行为，准确率达80%，F1分数0.81，显著优于基线方法，证明生成式AI在教育对话分析中的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动编码对话行为耗时耗力，需要探索自动化方法来提高效率并降低人工成本

Method: 使用开源CIMA语料库，测试GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4模型，采用定制化提示进行对话行为分类

Result: GPT-4达到80%准确率、加权F1分数0.81、Cohen's Kappa 0.74，表现出与人工标注的显著一致性

Conclusion: 生成式AI为对话行为分类提供了高效可行的方法，但需要注意任务特定的标签定义和伦理考量

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

### [12] [ViRanker: A BGE-M3 & Blockwise Parallel Transformer Cross-Encoder for Vietnamese Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09131)
*Phuong-Nam Dang,Kieu-Linh Nguyen,Thanh-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ViRanker是一个专门为越南语设计的跨编码器重排模型，基于BGE-M3编码器并集成块并行Transformer，在MMARCO-VI指标上表现突出，超越多语言基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决越南语这种资源稀缺语言缺乏竞争力重排器的问题，越南语具有复杂的语法和韧标特征。

Method: 基于BGE-M3编码器构建，集成Blockwise Parallel Transformer，使用8GB精选语料库训练，采用混合难样本采样进行微调以提升模型稳健性。

Result: 在MMARCO-VI指标上获得了强劲的早期排名准确率，超越了多语言基线模型，与PhoRanker竞争性相当。模型已在Hugging Face开源发布。

Conclusion: ViRanker为越南语重排提供了高效解决方案，同时也为其他资源稀缺语言的重排技术发展突出了详细的架构适配和数据精选的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents ViRanker, a cross-encoder reranking model tailored to the
Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder是一个开源库，用于构建和基准测试神经编码模型，提供标准化工具来处理连续刺激与脑数据的对齐、特征转换、映射和模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低神经编码模型实现的技术门槛，促进模型和数据集之间的系统比较，提高方法严谨性，加速高质量脑活动预测模型的开发。

Method: 模块化流水线设计，涵盖多种方法选择：脑数据集、脑区域、刺激特征（神经网络基础和对照组）、下采样方法等，内置日志记录、绘图功能，并与实验跟踪平台无缝集成。

Result: 通过在三个故事聆听数据集（LeBel et al. (2023)、Narratives、Little Prince）上拟合多种编码模型，证明了框架的可扩展性和多功能性。

Conclusion: LITcoder有效降低了编码模型实施的技术障碍，促进了跨模型和数据集的有系统比较，增强了方法严谨性，并加速了高质量高性能脑活动预测模型的开发。

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的反事实增强去偏框架，通过反事实数据增强和自适应去偏对比学习机制，减少目标导向多模态情感分类中的虚假相关性，提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖文本内容且忽视数据集偏差（特别是词级上下文偏差），导致文本特征与输出标签之间的虚假相关性，影响分类精度。

Method: 采用反事实数据增强策略最小化改变情感相关因果特征，生成细节匹配的图像-文本样本；引入自适应去偏对比学习机制从反事实数据中学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的反事实增强去偏框架有效缓解了有偏词的影响，提升了目标导向多模态情感分类的性能。

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets

TL;DR: EchoX是一个语音到语音大语言模型，通过语义表示和动态生成语音训练目标来解决声学-语义差距问题，在有限训练数据下保持强大的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型(SLLMs)在知识和推理能力上存在退化，主要原因是训练范式未能弥合特征表示空间中的声学-语义差距。

Method: 提出EchoX方法，利用语义表示并动态生成语音训练目标，整合声学和语义学习。

Result: 实验表明，EchoX仅用约6000小时训练数据就在多个知识问答基准测试中达到先进性能。

Conclusion: EchoX成功解决了SLLMs的知识退化问题，通过声学-语义整合保持了强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The
project is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/EchoX.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多步预测的上下文偏置方法，避免传统Trie偏置中的分数撤销步骤，显著提升ASR模型对罕见词的识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Trie偏置方法在beam search中需要撤销部分假设的奖励分数，计算开销大且局限于beam search框架

Method: 通过让ASR模型进行多步前瞻预测，更好地估计部分假设是否能生成完整罕见词，避免分数撤销步骤。使用仅10小时合成数据微调Whisper模型

Result: 在NSC Part 2测试集上，词错误率从30.86%降至12.19%，性能显著提升

Conclusion: 多步预测方法有效解决了传统上下文偏置的计算开销问题，大幅改善了罕见词识别效果

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见词识别问题，但使用合成数据训练偏置模块容易导致过拟合，需要更有效的损失函数来提升模型性能

Method: 提出关键词意识损失函数，包括对偏置词的面具交叉瑣损失和偏置词位置二元分类损失，改进TCPGen基于上下文的偏置方法

Result: 在10小时合成数据上对Whisper进行适配，在NSC Part 2测试集上将词误率从29.71%降低到11.81%

Conclusion: 关键词意识损失函数能够有效提升上下文偏置方法的性能，通过补充性的偏置词预测和位置检测，显著改善了罕见词识别结果

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

TL;DR: GmSLM是一个针对狨猴叫声的生成式语音语言模型，通过无监督野外数据和弱标记对话数据评估，在声学匹配和下游任务中表现优异，为研究发声交流的神经基础提供了实用框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 狨猴表现出复杂的发声交流能力，具有类似人类语言的特征，但由于其主要通过叫声交流，标准LLM方法不适用，需要专门优化的语音语言模型来研究发声与大脑活动的联系。

Method: 开发了GmSLM生成式狨猴语音语言模型管道，设计了新颖的零样本评估指标，使用无监督野外数据和弱标记对话数据进行评估，并与基于人类语音的基线进行比较。

Result: GmSLM生成的叫声在声学上与真实重合成样本高度匹配，在下游任务中表现良好，能够有效区分真实和人工对话，尽管完全无监督但仍表现优异。

Conclusion: GmSLM为研究发声交流的神经基础提供了实用框架，有望推动神经科学、生物声学和进化生物学领域的未来研究，建立了发声与大脑活动之间的联系。

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Motivation: 扩展语言模型到更长上下文对于捕捉扩展语篇中的丰富依赖关系至关重要，但简单的上下文扩展会带来显著的计算和内存负担，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出CCF框架，整合分段语义聚合与键值记忆编码，形成紧凑表示；引入训练效率优化策略，结合增量分段解码和稀疏储层采样来减少内存开销。

Conclusion: 结构化压缩在可扩展和有效的长上下文语言建模方面具有巨大潜力，CCF框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

Abstract: Accurately assessing candidate seniority from resumes is a critical yet
challenging task, complicated by the prevalence of overstated experience and
ambiguous self-presentation. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of
large language models (LLMs), including fine-tuned BERT architectures, for
automating seniority classification in resumes. To rigorously evaluate model
performance, we introduce a hybrid dataset comprising both real-world resumes
and synthetically generated hard examples designed to simulate exaggerated
qualifications and understated seniority. Using the dataset, we evaluate the
performance of Large Language Models in detecting subtle linguistic cues
associated with seniority inflation and implicit expertise. Our findings
highlight promising directions for enhancing AI-driven candidate evaluation

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利对联合国可持续发展目标(SDG)的分类对于追踪创新如何应对全球挑战至关重要，但缺乏大规模标注数据集限制了监督学习的应用，现有方法缺乏可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 将专利-SDG分类构建为弱监督问题，使用专利到SDG标记科学文献的引用作为噪声初始信号。开发复合标注函数，利用大语言模型从专利和SDG论文中提取结构化概念(功能、解决方案、应用)，基于专利本体计算跨域相似度得分，采用基于排序的检索方法结合得分。

Conclusion: 弱监督和语义对齐可以大规模增强SDG分类，该方法能够有效训练多标签回归模型，为专利-SDG映射提供可靠的银标准数据集。

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

<details>

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要针对独立LLM，无法解决RAG系统中响应必须与检索证据一致的特殊挑战，企业应用中需要可靠的幻觉检测来确保AI系统的可信部署。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)分解答案为原子事实；2)使用同义词和反义词替换生成受控变异；3)根据检索上下文验证变异（同义词应被蕴含，反义词应被矛盾）；4)将不一致性惩罚聚合成响应级幻觉分数。

Conclusion: MetaRAG提供了一个实时、无监督、黑盒的幻觉检测解决方案，特别适用于身份敏感查询，能够定位不支持的声明并支持系统设计者配置阈值和安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

Motivation: 类比推理是人类认知的重要方面，但NLP研究通常不从认知科学的角度看待这些过程，需要建立两者之间的联系以改进关系理解。

Method: 总结认知科学文献中类比推理的关键理论，并将其与NLP概念相关联，分析这些理论如何适用于NLP的主要挑战。

Result: 研究表明认知科学的类比推理理论可以很好地与NLP概念连接，并为NLP研究中的多个主要挑战提供相关见解。

Conclusion: 通过认知科学的视角来理解类比推理过程，可以指导研究者更好地优化文本中的关系理解，减少对实体层面相似性的过度依赖。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

Conclusion: 层次括号编码是一种实用的依赖图解析方法，在保持结构完整性的同时显著减少了标签空间，取得了优异的解析性能。

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and
multi-formalism benchmark, showing competitive results and consistent
improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Conclusion: GrACE为LLM部署提供了可扩展、可靠且实时的置信度估计实用解决方案，具有改善最终决策准确性和减少计算需求的潜力。

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

Result: 经过KG增强的微调SBERT模型在高STR区域表现最佳，RMSE比强基线降低了25%，展示了KG与文本嵌入结合的优势。

Conclusion: 分层性能分析揭示了全局指标隐藏的模型优缺点，支持在HR系统等需要公平性、可解释性和上下文匹配的应用中进行更有针对性的模型选择。

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型快速重塑了金融NLP领域，但传统调查方法跟不上这种变革速度，需要新的方法来结构化分析研究趋势

Method: 定义了金融NLP研究本体论，基于LLM的提取管道处理了681篇论文(2022-2025)，构建可查询的知识图谱进行大规模数据分析

Result: 揭示了三个关键阶段：早期LLM采用和任务/数据集创新；对LLM局限性的批判性反思；外围技术向模块化系统的日益整合

Conclusion: MetaGraph提供了对金融NLP演变的清晰理解，突出了新兴趋势和方法论转变，同时展示了可在其他领域复用的科学进展映射方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific
progress in other domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过GPT零检测大五人格特征，并将其集成到SAMI系统中，以提升在线课程社交推荐的相关性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程环境对社交联系造成障碍，现有SAMI系统因缺乏完整的心理理论能力，无法准确推断学生人格特征，影响推荐的相关性

Method: 利用GPT的零检测能力，从论坛介绍帖子中推断大五人格特征，并将模型集成到SAMI实体基于的匹配系统中

Result: 证明GPT模型在人格检测任务中表现有效，人格特征可以补充现有匹配因素

Conclusion: 人格特征可以提升社交推荐质量，但需要进一步评估以确定对学生参与度和匹配质量的完整影响

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

TL;DR: EXPRESS基准数据集评估LLM在细粒度情感识别方面与人类情感的对齐程度，发现LLM在准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感方面仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将情感分类为预定义的有限类别，忽略了更细微的情感表达，需要评估LLM是否能在细粒度水平上与人类情感对齐。

Method: 引入EXPRESS基准数据集（包含251个细粒度情感标签），通过综合评估框架分析预测情感术语并将其分解为八种基本情感，系统测试主流LLM在不同提示设置下的表现。

Result: LLM准确预测与人类自我披露情感一致的情感仍然具有挑战性；某些LLM能生成符合情感理论和定义的情感术语，但在捕捉上下文线索方面不如人类自我披露有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在细粒度情感对齐方面的局限性，为未来增强其上下文理解能力的研究提供了见解。

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Motivation: 在医疗证明不可用的资源有限地区，口头尸检是估计死因的关键工具，需要开发更准确的方法来改善全球健康监测

Method: 结合大语言模型（GPT-5）、传统算法方法和基于嵌入的分类，构建LA-VA管道，在PHMRC数据集的三个年龄类别上进行评估

Result: GPT-5获得最高个体性能：成人48.6%、儿童50.5%、新生儿53.5%的准确率，比传统统计机器学习基线高出5-10%

Conclusion: 现成的大语言模型辅助方法可以显著提高口头尸检准确性，对低收入地区的全球健康监测具有重要意义

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%
(Neonate), outperforming traditional statistical machine learning baselines by
5-10%. Our findings suggest that simple off-the-shelf LLM-assisted approaches
could substantially improve verbal autopsy accuracy, with important
implications for global health surveillance in low-resource settings.

Motivation: 现有方法通常独立微调各智能体，导致能力差距和协调性差，需要改进多智能体系统的协作效果

Method: 交替进行两个关键阶段：规划智能体对齐（优化子目标序列生成）和接地智能体改进（使用多样化子目标-动作对进行微调）

Result: 理论分析证明MOAT确保非递减且渐进收敛的训练过程，实验显示在六个基准测试中优于最先进基线

Conclusion: MOAT通过迭代对齐有效解决了多智能体系统中的协调问题，显著提升了任务性能

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文通过CAMA和ABP技术在心算数学任务中发现了大语言模型中的"All-for-One"子图结构，证明有意义的计算仅在最后一个token的深层进行，通过特定中间层获取其他token信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在心算数学任务中的内部运作机制，探索自注意力和MLP层如何实现token间信息传递和计算。

Method: 使用Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) 和 Attention-Based Peeking (ABP)两种新方法，通过在初始层抑制输入特定计算、在中间层限制信息传递路径、在后期层强制所有计算在最后一个token进行的三步过程来分析模型行为。

Result: 发现了在多种算术表达式上都有高准确性的All-for-One子图(AF1)，该子图对模型性能无法成功且必需，能够跨模型转移并适应不同输入风格。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在心算任务中的关键计算凭借特定的All-for-One子结构完成，CAMA和ABP方法在模型解析方面有独特优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

TL;DR: SteerMoE框架通过检测和控制MoE模型中的行为相关专家，无需重新训练即可调节LLM的安全性和忠实度，同时也能用于对抗攻击绕过安全防护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型中的专家网络可能包含特定的行为模式，需要一种方法来检测和控制这些专家以调节模型行为，同时发现对齐伪装的安全隐患

Method: 通过对比不同行为输入的专家激活模式来检测行为相关专家，在推理时选择性激活/停用这些专家来控制模型行为

Result: 在11个基准测试和6个LLM上，安全性能提升高达20%，忠实度提升27%；对抗攻击模式下可单独降低安全性41%，与现有越狱方法结合可完全绕过所有安全防护

Conclusion: SteerMoE提供了一种无需重新训练的控制MoE模型行为的方法，同时揭示了专家网络中隐藏的对齐伪装风险，为模型安全提供了新的视角

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在探索不足、早熟收敛和熵崩溃的问题，需要更好的探索机制来提升大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用演员生成响应的困惑度和评论家多头架构的价值估计方差作为好奇心信号，作为探索奖励融入RLVR框架

Result: 在AIME基准测试中比标准RLVR(GRPO/PPO)方法提升约3个点，并揭示了RLVR中的校准崩溃机制

Conclusion: CDE框架通过内在好奇心信号有效解决了RLVR的探索问题，理论分析显示该方法能惩罚过度自信错误并促进回答多样性，为理解LLM失败模式提供了新视角

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，能够有效处理多模态查询和多模态文档检索任务，在性能和效率方面都优于现有方法，为多模态检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Motivation: 人类能在不同物种、视角和环境下识别相同动作，但当前深度学习模型在此类泛化上表现不佳，需要提升模型的动作识别鲁棒性

Method: 采用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过transformer进行聚合，特别使用早期时间步的条件模型来强调语义信息而非像素细节

Result: 在跨物种、跨视角和跨上下文三个泛化基准测试中都达到了新的state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading

VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要鲁棒的噪声处理方案

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似度任务，采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta混合分布建模嵌入对余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上，在10-30%噪声水平下均优于现有最优方法，表现出鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD通过统计建模相似度分布有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，为噪声环境下的目标重识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于现有方法，狭窄检测中达到最高真阳性率和阳性预测值

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net能有效提升冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测性能，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Motivation: 研究不同生成模型学习到的视觉表示在何时以及如何出现分歧，发现一个模型生成而另一个模型不生成的视觉属性

Method: 引入CompCon进化搜索算法，创建自动化数据生成管道ID2数据集，与LLM和VLM基线方法进行比较

Conclusion: CompCon能有效识别文本到图像模型间的视觉表示差异，为模型比较和理解提供了新工具

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Transformer全局注意力机制的新型视觉Transformer架构，通过在注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，有效解决了ViT在小数据集上局部特征提取不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然通过自注意力机制在计算机视觉领域取得了显著成果，但在小数据集上过度关注全局上下文而忽视了局部特征提取，缺乏位置偏置和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，将分层移位窗口注意力与局部卷积特征学习相结合，在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，使模型能够同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个图像分类基准测试中均取得性能提升，相比基线Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，证明了结合卷积局部性和Transformer全局建模的优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的几何一致性问题，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局一致性的完全可微框架，以提高配准的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 首先使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵，然后通过双向源到目标和目标到源匹配的重新定位步骤进行细化，最后通过全局几何一致性学习堆叠配对点特征来预测点级匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在多个真实世界数据集上显著提升了刚性配准性能。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过完全可微的框架有效整合了局部和全局几何一致性，在室内外不同场景的点云配准任务中都表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性，达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为更准确的3D重建铺平了道路，代码和数据集将开源

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 自动量化心肌内运动和应变从标记MRI仍然是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，需要开发更准确和高效的方法

Method: 使用基于学习潜在码的条件隐式神经表示(INRs)来预测连续左心室位移，无需推理时优化

Result: 在452个UK Biobank测试案例中，该方法实现了最佳跟踪精度(2.14 mm RMSE)和最低的全局周向应变(2.86%)和径向应变(6.42%)组合误差，比最准确的基线快约380倍

Conclusion: 基于INR的模型适用于大规模CMR数据集中心肌应变的准确和可扩展分析

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器平等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精准的边界区分机制

Method: 集成动态权重策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器预测，针对每个目标样本聚焦最相关的类别边界

Result: 在VisDA和ImageCLEF上获得最高平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA设置和19个开放集DA设置中优于MLNet基线

Conclusion: E-MLNet通过聚焦适应策略显著提升了已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了动态权重策略的有效性

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu是首个大规模乌尔都语图像字幕数据集，包含5.9万张图片和31.9万个字幕，通过分层采样和多模态质量评估框架构建，旨在解决乌尔都语在多模态研究中的资源匮乏问题。


<details>

Motivation: 乌尔都语作为2.5亿人使用的语言，在多模态和视觉语言研究中严重缺乏资源，现有数据集主要针对高资源语言，导致多语言视觉语言模型存在偏见。

Method: 从MS COCO数据集通过分层采样构建，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，并采用混合多模态质量评估框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP相似度、BERTScore加回译）进行验证和迭代优化。

Result: 数据集包含59,000张图片和319,000个乌尔都语字幕，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF等基准测试中表现优异，是目前最大的公开乌尔都语字幕数据集。

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu填补了乌尔都语多模态研究的空白，通过发布数据集和质量评估流程，有助于减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为包容性视觉语言系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We
introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that
enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer
integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression
and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations
aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes

Conclusion: PCGM在保持细微解剖学变异方面取得重要进展，为研究细微形态差异的合成MRI应用树立了重要里程碑。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

*Hengyu Fang,Yijiang Liu,Yuan Du,Li Du,Huanrui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA是一个无需训练的结构化VLA推理加速框架，通过协同设计量化和token剪枝，实现了计算效率和推理速度的显著提升，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA压缩和加速方法采用临时性的量化或token剪枝，但由于观察到的不兼容性，无法同时实现两者以获得整体效率提升。

Method: 提出新的量化感知token剪枝标准，在激进量化模型上工作，同时改进量化器设计以增强剪枝效果，实现量化和token剪枝的协同设计。

Result: 在标准VLA模型上实现了1.93倍的加速，平均成功率提升高达4.5%，同时显著提高了计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA框架成功解决了量化和token剪枝的不兼容问题，为VLA模型的实用部署提供了有效的推理加速解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc是一个基于鸟瞰图的自监督LiDAR全局定位框架，无需地面真值姿态，通过地理距离构建训练三元组，在KITTI和NCLT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LiDAR全局定位方法依赖GPS或SLAM里程计获取的地面真值姿态进行监督训练，但高精度地面真值姿态获取成本高且费力。

Method: 使用单张BEV图像构建训练三元组，利用关键点中心BEV补丁之间的已知地理距离。采用CNN提取局部特征，NetVLAD聚合全局描述符，并引入SoftCos损失增强三元组学习。

Result: 在KITTI和NCLT大型数据集上的实验表明，S-BEVLoc在位置识别、闭环检测和全局定位任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc提供了一种无需地面真值姿态的自监督LiDAR全局定位解决方案，具有高度可扩展性，而监督方法需要额外努力才能实现相同的可扩展性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg是一个零样本分割方法，用于从顶视图图像中分割莲座状植物个体，无需训练即可实现跨物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的植物个体分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础分割模型能够零样本提取顶视图作物图像中的叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然具有挑战性，通常需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 结合基础分割模型提取叶片实例和视觉语言模型推理植物结构，无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Result: 在多个植物物种、生长阶段和拍摄环境的数据集上评估显示，该方法超越了现有零样本方法，并比监督方法具有更好的跨域性能。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本植物个体分割解决方案，减少了标注需求并实现了良好的跨域适应性。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

TL;DR: 本论文提出了GA-DMS框架，通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进来提升CLIP在人物表征学习中的性能，包括构建WebPerson数据集和引入梯度注意力引导的双掩码协同机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在人物表征学习中面临两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模标注的人物中心视觉语言数据，以及全局对比学习难以保持细粒度匹配所需的判别性局部特征且易受噪声文本标记影响。

Method: 1) 开发基于MLLM上下文学习能力的噪声抵抗数据构建管道，自动过滤和标注网络图像，构建包含500万高质量人物中心图像-文本对的WebPerson数据集；2) 提出GA-DMS框架，通过梯度注意力相似性评分自适应掩码噪声文本标记，并引入掩码标记预测目标增强细粒度语义表征学习。

Result: 大量实验表明，GA-DMS在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过数据构建和模型架构的协同改进，GA-DMS框架有效解决了CLIP在人物表征学习中的关键挑战，显著提升了跨模态对齐和细粒度语义表征能力。

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标记数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1) Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2) 正负掩码约束嵌入几何一致性；3) 透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型框架，在多种临床应用中都展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持久同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)这两种不同方法在从数据推断拓扑结构时的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN在拓扑估计中的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: ANN在噪声条件下表现优于PH方法，ANN能够从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验，从而提供更好的噪声鲁棒性

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展阶段，但ANN为结构噪声下的拓扑估计提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，有望在某些场景下超越传统的PH方法

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标主要评估整体图像质量，与人类感知存在差异。受神经心理学启发，作者认为人类识别3D场景时主要关注单个对象

Method: 利用对象检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个对象的"对象性"，进行以对象为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更符合人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估标准，有助于澄清3D重建和生成领域的进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该调查不仅提供了全面的回顾，还为平衡可扩展性和任务需求的模型设计提供了实用指导，推动了通用视频理解的发展路线图。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

Motivation: 现有方法直接将检索到的知识信息增强模型，但忽略了大量知识冗余问题，这会在回答过程中引入噪声

Method: 1) 从图像-问题对中提取关键部分创建低噪声查询；2) 使用大模型识别和提取对答案有益的知识片段；3) 引入选择性知识集成策略，仅在模型缺乏信心时整合知识

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该框架优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够获取准确且关键的知识，有效缓解冗余信息的影响

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 高光谱图像虽然光谱信息丰富，但波段多、维度高、光谱混合导致特征冗余问题突出，需要更精细的地物分类方法。

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱数据，提出CWSSNet框架，集成多模态信息的多尺度卷积注意力模块，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作。

Result: 在余干县获得mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%，在水体、植被、裸地分类中IoU最高，小样本训练下性能可靠。

Conclusion: CWSSNet框架有效突破传统方法性能瓶颈，具有良好的鲁棒性和小样本训练能力，为高光谱地物分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated
images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection
methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on
human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.

### [71] [Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183)
*Jiasheng Guo,Xin Gao,Yuxiang Yan,Guanghao Li,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应性Dark-ISP插件，直接处理黑暗环境下的Bayer RAW图像，通过异步线性和非线性子模块的训练优化，实现了更好的低光环境物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低光物体检测方法或者使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂框架，而RAW图像在低光环境中具有更好的潜力。

Method: 将传统ISP流水线解构为线性传感器校准和非线性音调映射子模块，通过任务驱动损失进行微分优化，每个模块都具有内容感知适应性和物理信息先验知识，并设计了自我提升机制促进子模块合作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上进行的实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境中，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测方法。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP插件能够通过轻量级的设计实现突出的低光物体检测性能，为实际应用提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和跨解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步细化预测，生成全分辨率体积输出；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入之间的长程交互。

Result: 在涵盖未见临床中心、器官、物种和成像模态的广泛数据集上评估，Medverse显著优于现有上下文学习基线方法。

Conclusion: Medverse为医学影像上下文学习建立了新范式，代码和模型权重将公开提供。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt是用于胃组织图像组织病理学分类的鲁棒架构，在二分类和多分类任务上都表现出优异性能，具有辅助病理学家提高诊断准确性和减少工作量的潜力。

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长视频中的长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时序理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样策略(TASS)：1)将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳交错构建连续时序参考系统；2)将视频采样重构为视觉-语言检索任务，采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时序覆盖

Result: 在7B和72B模型上均取得最先进性能，特别是在小时级视频基准上表现出色。7B模型甚至在某些基准上超越了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法通过显式的时间建模和语义引导的采样策略，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解能力，为长视频分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg是成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

Result: 在多样化图表理解基准测试中表现出强大且鲁棒的性能

Conclusion: VLMs不仅可以学习推理，还可以学习如何推理，为每个任务动态选择最优推理路径

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object
detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

### [83] [Learning Object-Centric Representations in SAR Images with Multi-Level Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09298)
*Oh-Tae Jang,Min-Gon Cho,Kyung-Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一个针对SAR图像的目标中心学习框架，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制，无需掩码标注即可将目标表征与背景杂波分离，在SAR图像分类中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的目标与复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）在强度和模式上相似，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级槽注意力模块整合多级特征，增强槽间表征区分度。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中实现了最先进的性能，相比现有OCL方法能更好地保留结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征融合和注意力机制，有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，为无掩码标注的SAR目标识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHCP框架通过推理时自训练适配器实现异构协作感知，无需联合训练或标注数据，在少量无标签数据下达到与全数据集训练SOTA方法相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中不同车辆模型异构性带来的协作感知挑战，现有方法需要联合训练或预先存储所有可能协作模型，不实用

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时动态自训练适配器对齐特征

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上广泛实验表明，PHCP在多样化异构场景中表现强劲，仅用少量无标签数据就达到与全数据集训练SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP成功解决了异构协作感知的挑战，无需联合训练，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Motivation: 虽然视觉-语言模型在零样本分类中表现强劲，但其纯视觉推理能力仍未充分探索，需要对语言导向和视觉两种方式进行综合评估和利用。

Method: 使用SigLIP 2和RADIOv2.5等多种双编码器VLM模型，在ImageNet-1k数据集上进行标准化测试，分析提示设计、类别多样性、k-NN近邻数量等因素，并提出基于类别精度的无学习融合方法。

Result: 语言和视觉在图像分类中具有补充性优势，不同类别适合不同的推理方式，融合方法能够显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 语言导向和视觉推理在VLM图像识别中具有补充性，通过简单的融合策略可以有效利用这种优势，为提升零样本分类性能提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where
the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry.
Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自监督预训练策略对少样本外科手术技能评估的影响，发现领域相关的小数据集优于大规模但领域不匹配的数据集，并在1-shot、2-shot和5-shot设置中分别达到60.16%、66.03%和73.65%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外科手术技能评估(SSA)面临技能标注稀缺的挑战，因为标注耗时且需要专家共识。少样本学习(FSL)提供了可扩展的替代方案，但其成功关键取决于有效的预训练策略。

Method: 将SSA制定为少样本任务，评估不同自监督预训练策略。标注公开可用的机器人手术数据集并使用OSATS评分，在三种少样本设置下评估各种预训练源。量化领域相似性并分析领域差距和程序特定数据对可迁移性的影响。

Result: 领域相关的小数据集表现优于大规模但领域不匹配的数据集。将程序特定数据与领域相关外部数据集结合预训练可显著提升下游性能，平均准确率提升+1.22%，F1分数提升+2.28%。

Conclusion: 预训练数据与目标任务的领域相关性比数据规模更重要。领域对齐的预训练策略能有效提升少样本外科手术技能评估性能，而领域不匹配的大规模数据反而可能导致性能下降。

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench

Conclusion: 纹理引导的优化框架在固有图像分解中表现出色，特别是在处理复杂光照和纹理场景时具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Motivation: 研究PnP方法与扩散模型之间的联系，特别是在去噪机制和采样过程方面的差异，旨在为单像素成像等逆问题提供更好的重建解决方案。

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性执行和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真项，直接在去噪估计上应用混合校正。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量，改善了测量一致性而不破坏扩散采样轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过统一框架整合学习先验与物理前向模型，提出的混合数据一致性方法在保持扩散采样稳定性的同时有效提升了逆问题求解的性能。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动的两阶段框架，通过视神经射线径测量和临床数据融合，实现了净确的脱脉压分级预测，显著提升了非侵入性脱内压评估的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脱内压升高对腥功能构成严重威胁，需要及时监测。虽然腰穿刺是金标准，但其侵入性和风险驱动了对非侵入方案的需求。视神经射线径作为有前景的生物标记物，但现有手工测量方法存在不一致性、主观性和变异性问题。

Method: 提出全自动两阶段框架：第一阶段进行度底超声视频处理，包括帧级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别（按照国际共识声明）和精确的ONSD测量；第二阶段融合ONSD指标和临床特征进行脱内压分级预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在验证集上达到了$0.845 \pm 0.071$ 的准确率（五折交叉验证标准偏差），在独立测试集上达到了0.786的准确率，显著超过传统基于阈值的方法（验证准确率$0.637 \pm 0.111$，测试准确率0.429）。

Conclusion: 通过有效减少操作变异性和融合多源信息，该框架为临床ICP评估建立了可靠的非侵入方法，有望改善急性神经疾病患者的管理水平。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法需要外部正常图像库对比，但IC布局差异大且对齐困难，方法脆弱。缺陷通常是局部的，而每张图像中仍包含丰富的正常模式。

Method: 设计可学习正常信息提取器从测试图像中聚合典型正常特征，通过一致性损失确保特征与正常区域关联。在这些特征指导下，解码器重构只包含正常内容的图像，通过重构次差进行缺陷分割。使用伪异常增广稳定训练。

Result: 在三个IC制造步骤数据集上进行实验，结果表明方法在各种控制方法中均有持续改进，并对产品变化具有强壁壁性。

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC制造中的缺陷，免需外部正常数据支持，适应不同产品布局的变化，为IC制造业提供了更简单可靠的缺陷检测解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为来提高模型可靠性。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过扩散模型和语义引导机制，有效解决了低分辨率多模态图像融合的挑战，为军事侦察等实际应用提供了高质量的图像融合解决方案。

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入（如双模态或三模态），无法直接处理变化数量的输入，这限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 将扩散融合问题转化为基于扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模的最大似然估计问题，通过将期望最大化算法整合到扩散采样迭代过程中，实现任意数量输入模态的高质量融合。

Result: 在哈佛数据集上的实验表明，该方法在变化输入数量的医学图像融合中取得了最佳性能，同时在红外-可见光、多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务中也表现出优越性。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse方法有效解决了多模态医学图像融合中输入数量灵活性的问题，在多个任务和数据集上都表现出优异的性能，具有很好的临床应用前景。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人体运动分解为根关节坐标系中的局部运动和世界坐标系中的全局运动，但这两个分量并非独立。全局运动源于与环境的相互作用，而环境相互作用又由身体构型变化驱动。现有运动模型未能精确捕捉局部与全局动力学之间的物理耦合关系。

Method: 提出使用全身线性和角动量作为约束来连接局部运动与全局运动。动量反映了关节级动力学对身体空间运动的聚合效应，提供了将局部关节行为与全局位移相关联的物理基础方法。引入了新的损失项，强制生成的动量分布与真实数据中观察到的动量分布保持一致。

Result: 通过引入动量一致性损失，减少了脚部滑动和抖动，改善了平衡性，并保持了运动恢复的准确性。

Conclusion: 使用动量作为约束是连接局部运动与全局运动的有效方法，能够改善运动生成的质量和物理合理性。

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

Motivation: 传统3D超声系统成本高且复杂，传感器自由3D超声使用深度学习从2D图像序列估计探头轨迹。现有方法要么忽略全局特征，要么将其与局部特征提取紧密耦合，无法有效建模这两个互补方面。

Method: 提出DualTrack双编码器架构：局部编码器使用密集时空卷积捕获细粒度特征；全局编码器使用图像主干网络和时序注意力层嵌入高级解剖特征和长程依赖；轻量级融合模块结合这些特征估计轨迹。

Result: 在大型公共基准测试中，DualTrack实现了最先进的精度和全局一致的3D重建，优于先前方法，平均重建误差低于5毫米。

Conclusion: 解耦的局部和全局特征提取方法能够有效提升传感器自由3D超声的重建性能，DualTrack架构为3D超声的广泛应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional

improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部疾病诊断中可能出现捷径学习问题，即使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征进行预测，当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对少数群体的性能偏见。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个创新的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感肖像生成的统一，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟形象生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将指令条件仅视为由音频或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这影响了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型导演生成蓝图视频，控制高级语义如角色动作和情感；第二阶段在蓝图关键帧指导下，使用首尾帧策略并行生成多个子片段。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇形同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为基于语义的高保真音频驱动虚拟形象合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出混合机制学习框架，结合数学模型和扩散模型预测脑肿瘤时空进展，生成解剖学可行的未来MRI图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学临床决策至关重要，需要在数据有限的情况下实现生物信息化的图像生成

Method: 混合框架：数学肿瘤生长模型（ODE系统）捕捉时间动态+梯度引导DDIM扩散模型进行图像合成，使用BraTS数据集训练

Result: 在60个儿科DMG病例上评估，生成真实随访扫描，提供肿瘤生长概率图，显示临床相关生长范围和方向性

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限场景下实现生物信息化的图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

<details>

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注识别准确性，但忽略了模型识别何时所有选项都不正确的重要能力，这对可信AI至关重要

Method: 基于全景场景图数据集，利用细粒度场景图注释提取真实实体和关系，使用GPT-4-Turbo生成多选题并经过严格人工筛选，每个问题都包含"以上都不是"选项

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过明确要求拒绝错误选项，填补了当前评估套件的关键空白，为安全关键场景提供了更真实的MLLM可靠性衡量标准

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

TL;DR: 通过自动编码器视角提出统一多模态学习框架UAE，将图像理解与生成统一为编码器和解码器的双向信息流，通过重建保真度优化实现互益效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中理解与生成任务分离的问题，通过统一的重建目标实现双向信息流的协同优化

Method: 提出UAE框架：先用长上下文图像标注预训练解码器，然后通过统一强化学习Unified-GRPO进行三阶段训练：冷启动、生成促理解、理解促生成

Result: 编码器自主产生更描述性的标注，解码器能理解复杂描述并生成高保真的图像重建，实现了驱动多模态学习领域的"aha moment"

Conclusion: 通过统一的重建目标和双向优化，UAE框架成功实现了图像理解与生成的深度融合，为统一多模态模型的发展提供了新的视角和方法论

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE或扩散的方法无法充分建模人体运动的几何结构和物理约束，需要一种能够显式建模运动动力学并在底层关节几何结构上保持一致性的方法

Method: 在关节旋转、角速度和角加速度的乘积空间上构建神经距离场，提出自适应步长混合投影算法和几何积分器来生成合理运动轨迹

Result: 在AMASS数据集上训练后，NRMF在多种输入模态和任务上表现出显著优势，包括去噪、运动插值和部分2D/3D观测拟合

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的运动建模方法，在多个运动恢复任务上实现了优于现有方法的性能表现和泛化能力

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Motivation: 现有研究认为扩散模型性能差距源于卷积网络的平移等变性和局部性归纳偏置，但本文旨在证明局部性实际上是图像数据集的统计属性

Method: 通过分析最优参数化线性去噪器，理论推导和实验验证像素相关性导致局部性，并基于此构建改进的解析去噪器

Result: 证明局部性是图像数据集的统计特性，提出的解析去噪器比现有方法更能匹配深度扩散模型的预测分数

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性主要来源于自然图像数据集的像素相关性，而非卷积网络的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于构建更准确的解析模型

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video
and 3D vision research community.

Method: 开发了区间二型贝叶斯定理版本，使用保守方法避免输入不一致性；提出了将专家区间编码为二型模糊隶属函数的新算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理现实世界中不确定的概率信息提供了有效工具，扩展了贝叶斯定理在不确定环境下的应用能力。

Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses
against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of
precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is
unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information
from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates
of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two
key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.
First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and
conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs
that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel
and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy
membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities
in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this
problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for
Computing with Words applications.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI辅助游戏开发的关键空白，将LLM定位为流程化从游戏设计向实现过渡的价值工具

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for automated game template generation
by transforming Game Design Documents (GDDs) into functional Unity game
prototypes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and multi-modal Large
Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an end-to-end system that parses GDDs,
extracts structured game specifications, and synthesizes Unity-compatible C#
code that implements the core mechanics, systems, and architecture defined in
the design documentation. Our approach combines a fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model
specialized for Unity code generation with a custom Unity integration package
that streamlines the implementation process. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline models, with our fine-tuned model
achieving superior performance (4.8/5.0 average score) compared to
state-of-the-art LLMs across compilation success, GDD adherence, best practices
adoption, and code modularity metrics. The generated templates demonstrate high
adherence to GDD specifications across multiple game genres. Our system
effectively addresses critical gaps in AI-assisted game development,
positioning LLMs as valuable tools in streamlining the transition from game
design to implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述向MiniZinc约束满足模型的转换需要逻辑推理和约束编程专业知识，这一过程很具挑战性

Method: 采用多代理模型框架，每个专门的LLM代理负责检测和生成特定类型的全局约束代码，最后由一个组装代理整合成完整的MiniZinc模型

Result: 初步实验显示，该方法在多个LLM上都表现出比基线方法（如一次性提示和思维链提示）更好的性能

Conclusion: 通过任务分解和专门化的多代理方式，可以有效降低MiniZinc建模的复杂度，并为未来工作提供了丰富的改进方向

Abstract: Natural language descriptions of optimization or satisfaction problems are
challenging to translate into correct MiniZinc models, as this process demands
both logical reasoning and constraint programming expertise. We introduce a
framework that addresses this challenge with an agentic approach: multiple
specialized large language model (LLM) agents decompose the modeling task by
global constraint type. Each agent is dedicated to detecting and generating
code for a specific class of global constraint, while a final assembler agent
integrates these constraint snippets into a complete MiniZinc model. By
dividing the problem into smaller, well-defined sub-tasks, each LLM handles a
simpler reasoning challenge, potentially reducing overall complexity. We
conduct initial experiments with several LLMs and show better performance
against baselines such as one-shot prompting and chain-of-thought prompting.
Finally, we outline a comprehensive roadmap for future work, highlighting
potential enhancements and directions for improvement.

Conclusion: 损失函数设计为在合成数据时代保持生成模型质量提供了一个简单而强大的工具，通过控制模型对自生成数据的过度自信来有效缓解模型崩溃问题

Abstract: The increasing reliance on generative AI models has accelerated the
generation rate of synthetic data, with some projections suggesting that most
available new data for training could be machine-generated by 2030. This shift
to a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training
in synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model
performance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the
models ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and
detection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.
  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data
as a key driver of collapse. Building on this observation, we propose a
confidence-aware loss function that downweights high-confidence predictions
during training. We introduce a novel loss function we call Truncated Cross
Entropy (TCE). We demonstrate that TCE significantly delays model collapse in
recursive training.
  We provide a model-agnostic framework that links the loss function design to
model collapse mitigation and validate our approach both theoretically and
empirically, showing that it can extend the model's fidelity interval before
collapse by more than 2.3x. Finally, we show that our method generalizes across
modalities. These findings suggest that the design of loss functions provides a
simple yet powerful tool for preserving the quality of generative models in the
era of increasing synthetic data.

Motivation: 虽然可解释AI(XAI)已被广泛研究，但不确定性解释和全局解释这两个领域相对较少被关注。研究者希望填补这一空白，探索如何通过算法同时处理多个XAI概念来改善用户信任和理解。

Method: 选择了一个能够同时处理不确定性、鲁棒性和全局XAI概念的算法进行测试，重点评估该算法在信任校准方面的能力，并检查其复杂但直观的可视化方法对用户满意度和可解释性的影响。

Result: 研究发现该算法能够有效校准用户信任，尽管算法本身较为复杂，但其提供的直观可视化理解能够带来更高的用户满意度和人类可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使算法复杂，只要能够提供直观的可视化解释，就能显著提高用户满意度和可解释性，这为XAI系统的设计提供了重要指导，特别是在不确定性解释和全局解释方面。

Abstract: Explainable AI has become a common term in the literature, scrutinized by
computer scientists and statisticians and highlighted by psychological or
philosophical researchers. One major effort many researchers tackle is
constructing general guidelines for XAI schemes, which we derived from our
study. While some areas of XAI are well studied, we focus on uncertainty
explanations and consider global explanations, which are often left out. We
chose an algorithm that covers various concepts simultaneously, such as
uncertainty, robustness, and global XAI, and tested its ability to calibrate
trust. We then checked whether an algorithm that aims to provide more of an
intuitive visual understanding, despite being complicated to understand, can
provide higher user satisfaction and human interpretability.

Result: 在BioGPT、LLaMA-2、GPT-4等模型上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了precision@k和NDCG分数，特别是在低数据设置下

Conclusion: 基于提示的适应方法可以有效解决LLM推荐管道中的冷启动问题，及时的提示组合不仅具有句法意义，还能通过控制注意力尺度和解码器行为来提升功能效果

Abstract: The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of
recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral
information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a
few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a
context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\ Ds)\ \rightarrow\
R\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set,
and R\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic
experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2,
GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and
instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG
scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level
alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity.
Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but
also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder
conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be
considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in
LLM-based pipelines.

Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being
delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical
to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through
which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore,
different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents,
such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas
large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we
compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in
a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition
comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral
dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive
optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can
achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor
conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ
more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find
that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can
conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical
for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.

Abstract: Anti-money laundering (AML) actions and measurements are among the priorities
of financial institutions, for which machine learning (ML) has shown to have a
high potential. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and systematic
approach for developing ML pipelines to identify high-risk bank clients in a
dataset curated for Task 1 of the University of Toronto 2023-2024 Institute for
Management and Innovation (IMI) Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
Competition. The dataset included 195,789 customer IDs, and we employed a
16-step design and statistical analysis to ensure the final pipeline was
robust. We also framed the data in a SQLite database, developed SQL-based
feature engineering algorithms, connected our pre-trained model to the
database, and made it inference-ready, and provided explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) modules to derive feature importance. Our pipeline achieved
a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.961
with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.005. The proposed pipeline achieved second
place in the competition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能系统在自主任务执行和语言理性方面取得进展，但空间理解能力仍然有限，主要限于符号和序列处理。与之形成对比的是，人类空间智能基于多感官知觉、空间记忆和认知地图，能够在非结构化环境中进行灵活的上下文感知决策。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

Result: 在INTERACTION多智能体预测基准中排名第一，在Argoverse 2多世界预测基准上也达到最优性能

Conclusion: ProgD方法通过动态建模交互关系的演化，显著提升了多智能体运动预测的准确性和一致性

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding agents is crucial for the safe
planning of autonomous vehicles. Recent advancements have extended prediction
techniques from individual agents to joint predictions of multiple interacting
agents, with various strategies to address complex interactions within future
motions of agents. However, these methods overlook the evolving nature of these
interactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel progressive
multi-scale decoding strategy, termed ProgD, with the help of dynamic
heterogeneous graph-based scenario modeling. In particular, to explicitly and
comprehensively capture the evolving social interactions in future scenarios,
given their inherent uncertainty, we design a progressive modeling of scenarios
with dynamic heterogeneous graphs. With the unfolding of such dynamic
heterogeneous graphs, a factorized architecture is designed to process the
spatio-temporal dependencies within future scenarios and progressively
eliminate uncertainty in future motions of multiple agents. Furthermore, a
multi-scale decoding procedure is incorporated to improve on the future
scenario modeling and consistent prediction of agents' future motion. The
proposed ProgD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION
multi-agent prediction benchmark, ranking $1^{st}$, and the Argoverse 2
multi-world forecasting benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered autonomous agents are transforming
both digital and physical environments by enabling adaptive, multi-agent
collaboration. While these agents offer significant opportunities across
domains such as finance, healthcare, and smart manufacturing, their
unpredictable behaviors and heterogeneous capabilities pose substantial
governance and accountability challenges. In this paper, we propose a
blockchain-enabled layered architecture for regulatory agent collaboration,
comprising an agent layer, a blockchain data layer, and a regulatory
application layer. Within this framework, we design three key modules: (i) an
agent behavior tracing and arbitration module for automated accountability,
(ii) a dynamic reputation evaluation module for trust assessment in
collaborative scenarios, and (iii) a malicious behavior forecasting module for
early detection of adversarial activities. Our approach establishes a
systematic foundation for trustworthy, resilient, and scalable regulatory
mechanisms in large-scale agent ecosystems. Finally, we discuss the future
research directions for blockchain-enabled regulatory frameworks in multi-agent
systems.

Conclusion: 通过构建高质量数据集NbQA和提出Jupiter框架，有效提升了LLM在数据科学任务中的多步推理和工具使用能力，为自动化数据分析工作流程提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
science workflows, but existing models still struggle with multi-step reasoning
and tool use, which limits their effectiveness on complex data analysis tasks.
To address this, we propose a scalable pipeline that extracts high-quality,
tool-based data analysis tasks and their executable multi-step solutions from
real-world Jupyter notebooks and associated data files. Using this pipeline, we
introduce NbQA, a large-scale dataset of standardized task-solution pairs that
reflect authentic tool-use patterns in practical data science scenarios. To
further enhance multi-step reasoning, we present Jupiter, a framework that
formulates data analysis as a search problem and applies Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate diverse solution trajectories for value model
learning. During inference, Jupiter combines the value model and node visit
counts to efficiently collect executable multi-step plans with minimal search
steps. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-7B and 14B-Instruct models on
NbQA solve 77.82% and 86.38% of tasks on InfiAgent-DABench,
respectively-matching or surpassing GPT-4o and advanced agent frameworks.
Further evaluations demonstrate improved generalization and stronger tool-use
reasoning across diverse multi-step reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs, a powerful tool for structuring information through
relational triplets, have recently become the new front-runner in enhancing
question-answering systems. While traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches are proficient in fact-based and local context-based
extraction from concise texts, they encounter limitations when addressing the
thematic and holistic understanding of complex, extensive texts, requiring a
deeper analysis of both text and context. This paper presents a comprehensive
technical comparative study of three different methodologies for constructing
knowledge graph triplets and integrating them with Large Language Models (LLMs)
for question answering: spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP-OpenIE, and GraphRAG, all
leveraging open source technologies. We evaluate the effectiveness,
feasibility, and adaptability of these methods by analyzing their capabilities,
state of development, and their impact on the performance of LLM-based question
answering. Experimental results indicate that while OpenIE provides the most
comprehensive coverage of triplets, GraphRAG demonstrates superior reasoning
abilities among the three. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and
limitations of each method and provide insights into future directions for
improving knowledge graph-based question answering.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Tournaments are widely used models to represent pairwise dominance between
candidates, alternatives, or teams. We study the problem of providing certified
explanations for why a candidate appears among the winners under various
tournament rules. To this end, we identify minimal supports, minimal
sub-tournaments in which the candidate is guaranteed to win regardless of how
the rest of the tournament is completed (that is, the candidate is a necessary
winner of the sub-tournament). This notion corresponds to an abductive
explanation for the question,"Why does the winner win the tournament", a
central concept in formal explainable AI. We focus on common tournament
solutions: the top cycle, the uncovered set, the Copeland rule, the Borda rule,
the maximin rule, and the weighted uncovered set. For each rule we determine
the size of the smallest minimal supports, and we present polynomial-time
algorithms to compute them for all but the weighted uncovered set, for which
the problem is NP-complete. Finally, we show how minimal supports can serve to
produce compact, certified, and intuitive explanations.

Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments
that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit
communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered
in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,
synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily
on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,
law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in
physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit
communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial
coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and
adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative
online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and
team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and
coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by
measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements
within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136
participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.
Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while
adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,
suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal
dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over
time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in
role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive
strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support
systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the emergence of
general-purpose agents for automating end-to-end machine learning (ML)
workflows, including data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and
competition solving. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in task
coverage, domain diversity, difficulty modeling, and evaluation rigor, failing
to capture the full capabilities of such agents in realistic settings. We
present TAM Bench, a diverse, realistic, and structured benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based agents on end-to-end ML tasks. TAM Bench features three
key innovations: (1) A browser automation and LLM-based task acquisition system
that automatically collects and structures ML challenges from platforms such as
Kaggle, AIcrowd, and Biendata, spanning multiple task types and data modalities
(e.g., tabular, text, image, graph, audio); (2) A leaderboard-driven difficulty
modeling mechanism that estimates task complexity using participant counts and
score dispersion, enabling scalable and objective task calibration; (3) A
multi-dimensional evaluation framework incorporating performance, format
compliance, constraint adherence, and task generalization. Based on 150 curated
AutoML tasks, we construct three benchmark subsets of different sizes -- Lite,
Medium, and Full -- designed for varying evaluation scenarios. The Lite
version, with 18 tasks and balanced coverage across modalities and difficulty
levels, serves as a practical testbed for daily benchmarking and comparative
studies.

Abstract: Navigating and understanding complex and unknown environments autonomously
demands more than just basic perception and movement from embodied agents.
Truly effective exploration requires agents to possess higher-level cognitive
abilities, the ability to reason about their surroundings, and make more
informed decisions regarding exploration strategies. However, traditional RL
approaches struggle to balance efficient exploration and semantic understanding
due to limited cognitive capabilities embedded in the small policies for the
agents, leading often to human drivers when dealing with semantic exploration.
In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture that is specifically designed for
resource efficient semantic exploration. A key methodological contribution is
the integration of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) common-sense through a layered
reward function. The VLM query is modeled as a dedicated action, allowing the
agent to strategically query the VLM only when deemed necessary for gaining
external guidance, thereby conserving resources. This mechanism is combined
with a curriculum learning strategy designed to guide learning at different
levels of complexity to ensure robust and stable learning. Our experimental
evaluation results convincingly demonstrate that our agent achieves
significantly enhanced object discovery rates and develops a learned capability
to effectively navigate towards semantically rich regions. Furthermore, it also
shows a strategic mastery of when to prompt for external environmental
information. By demonstrating a practical and scalable method for embedding
common-sense semantic reasoning with autonomous agents, this research provides
a novel approach to pursuing a fully intelligent and self-guided exploration in
robotics.

Conclusion: TORSO方法有效解决了few-shot提示的局限性，能够更好地激发大语言模型的内在推理能力，在多种任务上实现优异性能

Abstract: The approaches that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate human
reasoning during response generation have emerged as an effective method for
enabling them to solve complex problems in a step-by-step manner, thereby
achieving superior performance. However, most existing approaches using
few-shot prompts to generate responses heavily depend on the provided examples,
limiting the utilization of the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.
Moreover, constructing task-specific few-shot prompts is often costly and may
lead to inconsistencies across different tasks. In this work, we introduce
Template-Oriented Reasoning (TORSO), which elicits the model to utilize
internal reasoning abilities to generate proper responses across various tasks
without the need for manually crafted few-shot examples. Our experimental
results demonstrate that TORSO achieves strong performance on diverse LLMs
benchmarks with reasonable rationales.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEDM是一个自演化的分布式内存框架，通过可验证写入、动态内存调度和跨域知识扩散来解决多智能体系统中的内存管理问题，提高推理准确性并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期多智能体系统产生大量轨迹和交互数据，现有内存管理方法存在噪声积累、内存膨胀和跨域泛化能力有限的问题，需要更高效可扩展的内存管理方案。

Method: SEDM框架包含三个核心组件：基于可重现回放的可验证写入准入、根据经验效用动态排序和整合条目的自调度内存控制器、以及抽象可重用见解以支持跨异构任务迁移的跨域知识扩散。

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，SEDM相比强基线方法提高了推理准确性，减少了token开销，并且能够将从事实验证中提炼的知识用于增强多跳推理能力。

Conclusion: SEDM为开放式多智能体协作提供了一个可扩展且可持续的内存机制，将内存从被动存储转变为主动自优化的组件。

Abstract: Long-term multi-agent systems inevitably generate vast amounts of
trajectories and historical interactions, which makes efficient memory
management essential for both performance and scalability. Existing methods
typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are
prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited
generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM,
Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that
transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing
component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible
replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and
consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge
diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across
heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM
improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong
memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact
verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a
scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent
collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.

TL;DR: 量子计算模型在组合泛化任务中表现优于经典组合模型，特别是在图像描述任务中，使用多热编码和CLIP图像向量编码都取得了积极结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI工具（如视觉语言模型）缺乏组合泛化能力的问题，探索量子模型在提高训练效率和性能方面的潜力。

Method: 使用变分量子电路在希尔伯特空间中学习组合张量模型的表示，采用两种图像编码技术：多热编码（MHE）和基于CLIP模型的角/幅度编码。

Result: 使用噪声MHE编码获得了良好的概念验证结果，在CLIP图像向量上的表现虽然参差不齐，但仍优于经典组合模型。

Conclusion: 量子模型在组合泛化任务中显示出潜力，特别是在图像编码方面，为未来量子AI在组合推理方面的发展提供了有希望的方向。

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a key facet of human cognition, but lacking
in current AI tools such as vision-language models. Previous work examined
whether a compositional tensor-based sentence semantics can overcome the
challenge, but led to negative results. We conjecture that the increased
training efficiency of quantum models will improve performance in these tasks.
We interpret the representations of compositional tensor-based models in
Hilbert spaces and train Variational Quantum Circuits to learn these
representations on an image captioning task requiring compositional
generalization. We used two image encoding techniques: a multi-hot encoding
(MHE) on binary image vectors and an angle/amplitude encoding on image vectors
taken from the vision-language model CLIP. We achieve good proof-of-concept
results using noisy MHE encodings. Performance on CLIP image vectors was more
mixed, but still outperformed classical compositional models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统顺序计算模式在确保准确性的同时，难以满足具身AI系统在动态环境中对高频率"思考"的需求，限制了实时应用性能。

Method: Auras框架将感知和生成模块解耦，提供受控的流水线并行化，并建立共享的公共上下文来解决数据陈旧性问题，保证准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，Auras平均提升吞吐量2.54倍，同时达到原始准确性的102.7%，实现了高吞吐量和稳定性能。

Conclusion: Auras有效克服了顺序计算的限制，为具身AI系统提供了高吞吐量的推理框架，在保持准确性的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless
integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency
input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while
effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the
necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we
present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize
the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the
perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them
to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem
that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public
context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy
of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by
2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating
its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and
providing high throughput.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，大语言模型在长任务执行中存在自我条件效应，单步准确率随步骤增加而下降，而思考模型能更好地执行长任务，模型规模扩展对长任务执行有显著益处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型规模扩展是否带来边际收益递减，以及模型在简单任务变长时失败的原因，重点关注执行能力而非推理能力。

Method: 通过明确提供知识和计划来隔离执行能力，分析不同规模模型在多步任务中的表现，观察自我条件效应，并对比思考模型的性能。

Result: 发现大模型能正确执行更多步骤，即使小模型有100%单步准确率；模型在包含先前错误的上下文中更容易犯错；思考模型没有自我条件效应且能执行更长的单步任务。

Conclusion: 通过关注执行能力可以解释LLM在复杂推理和简单长任务中的表现差异，模型规模和顺序测试时计算对长视野任务有巨大益处。

Abstract: Does continued scaling of large language models (LLMs) yield diminishing
returns? Real-world value often stems from the length of task an agent can
complete. We start this work by observing the simple but counterintuitive fact
that marginal gains in single-step accuracy can compound into exponential
improvements in the length of a task a model can successfully complete. Then,
we argue that failures of LLMs when simple tasks are made longer arise from
mistakes in execution, rather than an inability to reason. We propose isolating
execution capability, by explicitly providing the knowledge and plan needed to
solve a long-horizon task. We find that larger models can correctly execute
significantly more turns even when small models have 100\% single-turn
accuracy. We observe that the per-step accuracy of models degrades as the
number of steps increases. This is not just due to long-context limitations --
curiously, we observe a self-conditioning effect -- models become more likely
to make mistakes when the context contains their errors from prior turns.
Self-conditioning does not reduce by just scaling the model size. In contrast,
recent thinking models do not self-condition, and can also execute much longer
tasks in a single turn. We conclude by benchmarking frontier thinking models on
the length of task they can execute in a single turn. Overall, by focusing on
the ability to execute, we hope to reconcile debates on how LLMs can solve
complex reasoning problems yet fail at simple tasks when made longer, and
highlight the massive benefits of scaling model size and sequential test-time
compute for long-horizon tasks.

Result: 提出了新的不确定性分解方法，能够更好地量化模型相关和数据相关的不确定性成分

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络不确定性估计提供了更直观有效的方法，有助于高风险应用中的决策制定

Abstract: Evaluation of per-sample uncertainty quantification from neural networks is
essential for decision-making involving high-risk applications. A common
approach is to use the predictive distribution from Bayesian or approximation
models and decompose the corresponding predictive uncertainty into epistemic
(model-related) and aleatoric (data-related) components. However, additive
decomposition has recently been questioned. In this work, we propose an
intuitive framework for uncertainty estimation and decomposition based on the
signal-to-noise ratio of class probability distributions across different model
predictions. We introduce a variance-gated measure that scales predictions by a
confidence factor derived from ensembles. We use this measure to discuss the
existence of a collapse in the diversity of committee machines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个改进的矩阵乘法权重更新算法，在矩阵学习专家建议问题上实现了实例最优的遗憾界O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))，同时保持与MMWU相同的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MMWU算法在矩阵LEA问题上只能达到最小最大最优遗憾界O(√(Tlog d))，但无法实现实例最优性能。本文旨在开发一个既能保持计算效率又能获得更好遗憾界的算法。

Method: 首先建立了一个通用的基于势能的矩阵LEA框架，MMWU是其特例。然后通过拉普拉斯变换技术开发了新的单边Jensen迹不等式，使得能够应用超越指数势能的一般势能函数。最终使用虚误差函数导出的最优势能函数来构造算法。

Result: 新算法实现了实例最优遗憾界O(√(T·S(X||d⁻¹I_d)))，计算复杂度与MMWU相同。在量子态学习、去极化噪声、随机量子态和Gibbs态学习等应用中均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了矩阵LEA问题的第一个实例最优算法，改进是'免费'的（不增加计算成本），并在量子学习理论中展示了广泛的应用前景，包括预测非线性量子性质和量子虚拟冷却等。

Abstract: The Matrix Multiplicative Weight Update (MMWU) is a seminal online learning
algorithm with numerous applications. Applied to the matrix version of the
Learning from Expert Advice (LEA) problem on the $d$-dimensional spectraplex,
it is well known that MMWU achieves the minimax-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\log d})$, where $T$ is the time horizon. In this paper, we present
an improved algorithm achieving the instance-optimal regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{T\cdot S(X||d^{-1}I_d)})$, where $X$ is the comparator in the regret,
$I_d$ is the identity matrix, and $S(\cdot||\cdot)$ denotes the quantum
relative entropy. Furthermore, our algorithm has the same computational
complexity as MMWU, indicating that the improvement in the regret bound is
``free''.
  Technically, we first develop a general potential-based framework for matrix
LEA, with MMWU being its special case induced by the standard exponential
potential. Then, the crux of our analysis is a new ``one-sided'' Jensen's trace
inequality built on a Laplace transform technique, which allows the application
of general potential functions beyond exponential to matrix LEA. Our algorithm
is finally induced by an optimal potential function from the vector LEA
problem, based on the imaginary error function.
  Complementing the above, we provide a memory lower bound for matrix LEA, and
explore the applications of our algorithm in quantum learning theory. We show
that it outperforms the state of the art for learning quantum states corrupted
by depolarization noise, random quantum states, and Gibbs states. In addition,
applying our algorithm to linearized convex losses enables predicting nonlinear
quantum properties, such as purity, quantum virtual cooling, and R\'{e}nyi-$2$
correlation.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中奖励信号受到对抗性腐败（如极端噪声、传感器故障或恶意攻击）的问题，传统算法如Q-learning在此类腐败下性能严重下降

Method: 提出新的鲁棒Q-learning变体算法，在异步采样模型下工作，即使部分观测奖励被对手任意扰动也能有效运行。还提出了无需真实奖励分布统计先验知识的算法变体

Result: 建立了有限时间收敛率，与非对抗情况的结果匹配，仅增加与腐败样本比例成正比的附加项。推导了信息论下界证明该附加项不可避免

Conclusion: 为异步Q-learning提供了首个有限时间鲁棒性保证，填补了鲁棒强化学习的重要空白，提出的技术工具可能具有独立价值

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy in a discounted,
infinite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) setting where the reward signal is
subject to adversarial corruption. Such corruption, which may arise from
extreme noise, sensor faults, or malicious attacks, can severely degrade the
performance of classical algorithms such as Q-learning. To address this
challenge, we propose a new provably robust variant of the Q-learning algorithm
that operates effectively even when a fraction of the observed rewards are
arbitrarily perturbed by an adversary. Under the asynchronous sampling model
with time-correlated data, we establish that despite adversarial corruption,
the finite-time convergence rate of our algorithm matches that of existing
results for the non-adversarial case, up to an additive term proportional to
the fraction of corrupted samples. Moreover, we derive an information-theoretic
lower bound revealing that the additive corruption term in our upper bounds is
unavoidable.
  Next, we propose a variant of our algorithm that requires no prior knowledge
of the statistics of the true reward distributions. The analysis of this
setting is particularly challenging and is enabled by carefully exploiting a
refined Azuma-Hoeffding inequality for almost-martingales, a technical tool
that might be of independent interest. Collectively, our contributions provide
the first finite-time robustness guarantees for asynchronous Q-learning,
bridging a significant gap in robust RL.

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多源异构数据中的分布不确定性，提升最差组性能，适用于噪声和非平稳环境

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models critically depends on the
quality and representativeness of the training data. In applications with
multiple heterogeneous data generating sources, standard ML methods often learn
spurious correlations that perform well on average but degrade performance for
atypical or underrepresented groups. Prior work addresses this issue by
optimizing the worst-group performance. However, these approaches typically
assume that the underlying data distributions for each group can be accurately
estimated using the training data, a condition that is frequently violated in
noisy, non-stationary, and evolving environments. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that relies on Wasserstein-based distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to account for the distributional uncertainty within each
group, while simultaneously preserving the objective of improving the
worst-group performance. We develop a gradient descent-ascent algorithm to
solve the proposed DRO problem and provide convergence results. Finally, we
validate the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
underscoring the importance of accurate and scalable diagnostic systems.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities,
yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit
current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a
foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a
dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation,
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal
dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first
distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the
Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction
Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across
multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal
classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease
detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy,
as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides
risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion,
FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable
solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic
precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code
after acceptance.

Method: 将LRP归因方法表示为修正梯度矩阵的乘积，建立与链式法则中雅可比矩阵乘法的类比，推导奇异值上界和分量边界，获得控制收敛的乘性常数。

Result: 发现LRP-beta的常数与权重范数无关，这与基于梯度的方法和LRP-epsilon形成显著区别，对多数据增强和Smoothgrad型方法有重要影响。

Conclusion: LRP-beta方法在数值稳定性方面具有独特优势，其收敛常数不依赖于权重范数，这为实际应用中的归因方法选择提供了重要理论指导。

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: 碳感知的联邦学习调度策略能有效减少碳排放，同时保持模型准确性，特别是在碳预算紧张的情况下优势明显。

Abstract: Training large-scale machine learning models incurs substantial carbon
emissions. Federated Learning (FL), by distributing computation across
geographically dispersed clients, offers a natural framework to leverage
regional and temporal variations in Carbon Intensity (CI). This paper
investigates how to reduce emissions in FL through carbon-aware client
selection and training scheduling. We first quantify the emission savings of a
carbon-aware scheduling policy that leverages slack time -- permitting a modest
extension of the training duration so that clients can defer local training
rounds to lower-carbon periods. We then examine the performance trade-offs of
such scheduling which stem from statistical heterogeneity among clients,
selection bias in participation, and temporal correlation in model updates. To
leverage these trade-offs, we construct a carbon-aware scheduler that
integrates slack time, $\alpha$-fair carbon allocation, and a global
fine-tuning phase. Experiments on real-world CI data show that our scheduler
outperforms slack-agnostic baselines, achieving higher model accuracy across a
wide range of carbon budgets, with especially strong gains under tight carbon
constraints.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is
inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that
integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with
visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters.
PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and
elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer
mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of
the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional
design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration.
Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the
learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives
into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding
of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and
linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge
discovery.

sub-quadratic time complexity. We prove that ANNA-transformers (1) retain the
expressive power previously established for standard attention in terms of
matching the capabilities of MPC algorithms, and (2) can solve key reasoning
tasks such as Match2 and $k$-hop with near-optimal depth. Using the MPC
framework, we further prove that constant-depth ANNA-transformers can simulate
constant-depth low-rank transformers, thereby providing a unified way to reason
about a broad class of efficient attention approximations.

Result: 在多个表格标准数据集上进行了涉幅实验，结果显示该方法超越了现有最优方法，证明了考虑上下文对准确区分异常和正常实例的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了在表格数据异常检测中考虑上下文信息的重要性，提出的上下文条件框架能够有效地处理异质数据环境，为无监督异常检测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance,
especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised
anomaly detection -- where no labeled anomalies are available -- remains a
significant challenge. Although various deep learning methods have been
proposed to model a dataset's joint distribution, real-world tabular data often
contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users), making globally rare
events normal under certain contexts. Consequently, relying on a single global
distribution can overlook these contextual nuances, degrading detection
performance. In this paper, we present a context-conditional anomaly detection
framework tailored for tabular datasets. Our approach automatically identifies
context features and models the conditional data distribution using a simple
deep autoencoder. Extensive experiments on multiple tabular benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
underscoring the importance of context in accurately distinguishing anomalous
from normal instances.

TL;DR: 提出混合专家模型(MoWE)，通过ViT门控网络动态组合多个现有天气模型的输出，以更低计算成本获得比单个模型更好的预测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动的天气模型近年来性能提升趋于平缓，需要新的方法来突破现有局限，而不是重新开发新的预测模型

Method: 使用Vision Transformer门控网络，根据预测提前期条件动态学习为多个专家模型在每个网格点的贡献分配权重，合成确定性预测

Result: 在2天预测范围内，RMSE比最佳AI天气模型降低10%，显著优于单个专家模型和简单平均方法

Conclusion: 提供了一种计算高效且可扩展的策略，通过充分利用现有高质量预测模型来推动数据驱动天气预测的技术前沿

Abstract: Data-driven weather models have recently achieved state-of-the-art
performance, yet progress has plateaued in recent years. This paper introduces
a Mixture of Experts (MoWE) approach as a novel paradigm to overcome these
limitations, not by creating a new forecaster, but by optimally combining the
outputs of existing models. The MoWE model is trained with significantly lower
computational resources than the individual experts. Our model employs a Vision
Transformer-based gating network that dynamically learns to weight the
contributions of multiple "expert" models at each grid point, conditioned on
forecast lead time. This approach creates a synthesized deterministic forecast
that is more accurate than any individual component in terms of Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method,
achieving up to a 10% lower RMSE than the best-performing AI weather model on a
2-day forecast horizon, significantly outperforming individual experts as well
as a simple average across experts. This work presents a computationally
efficient and scalable strategy to push the state of the art in data-driven
weather prediction by making the most out of leading high-quality forecast
models.

Motivation: 可再生能源和分布式能源的集成改变了现代电力系统，对传统保护方案构成挑战，需要评估机器学习在电力系统保护中的应用现状和潜力。

Method: 采用PRISMA范围综述框架，基于100多篇文献进行综合分析，评估ML在保护任务中的研究范围、性能表现和适用方法。

Result: ML模型在模拟数据集上通常表现出高精度，但在真实条件下的性能验证不足；现有文献存在方法严谨性、数据集质量和评估指标不一致的问题。

Conclusion: 需要标准化报告实践、改进数据集文档和方法透明度，未来研究应优先考虑公共基准数据集、现实验证方法和先进ML架构，以推动ML保护从理论走向实际部署。

Abstract: The integration of renewable and distributed energy resources reshapes modern
power systems, challenging conventional protection schemes. This scoping review
synthesizes recent literature on machine learning (ML) applications in power
system protection and disturbance management, following the PRISMA for Scoping
Reviews framework. Based on over 100 publications, three key objectives are
addressed: (i) assessing the scope of ML research in protection tasks; (ii)
evaluating ML performance across diverse operational scenarios; and (iii)
identifying methods suitable for evolving grid conditions. ML models often
demonstrate high accuracy on simulated datasets; however, their performance
under real-world conditions remains insufficiently validated. The existing
literature is fragmented, with inconsistencies in methodological rigor, dataset
quality, and evaluation metrics. This lack of standardization hampers the
comparability of results and limits the generalizability of findings. To
address these challenges, this review introduces a ML-oriented taxonomy for
protection tasks, resolves key terminological inconsistencies, and advocates
for standardized reporting practices. It further provides guidelines for
comprehensive dataset documentation, methodological transparency, and
consistent evaluation protocols, aiming to improve reproducibility and enhance
the practical relevance of research outcomes. Critical gaps remain, including
the scarcity of real-world validation, insufficient robustness testing, and
limited consideration of deployment feasibility. Future research should
prioritize public benchmark datasets, realistic validation methods, and
advanced ML architectures. These steps are essential to move ML-based
protection from theoretical promise to practical deployment in increasingly
dynamic and decentralized power systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个可扩展的XAI框架，通过RKHS中的正交函数分解避免特征子集枚举，提供功能组件而非单一标量归因，在表格数据上实现快速且高保真的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有XAI框架的两个主要限制：特征子集枚举的指数级计算成本和将效应总结为单一标量值的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中采用正交函数分解，通过递归核中心化程序的分析投影方案计算功能组件f_S(x_S)，避免显式子集枚举。

Result: 在10个数据集上实现中位数约3倍的加速(0.6-9.7倍范围)，保持高保真度(R^2在0.81-0.999之间)和大部分数据集上的显著排名一致性。

Conclusion: STRIDE通过提供结构化功能视角补充标量归因方法，支持新颖的诊断功能如'组件手术'来量化特定交互作用的影响。

Abstract: Most explainable AI (XAI) frameworks face two practical limitations: the
exponential cost of reasoning over feature subsets and the reduced
expressiveness of summarizing effects as single scalar values. We present
STRIDE, a scalable framework that aims to mitigate both issues by framing
explanation as a subset-enumeration-free, orthogonal functional decomposition
in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Rather than focusing only on
scalar attributions, STRIDE computes functional components f_S(x_S) via an
analytical projection scheme based on a recursive kernel-centering procedure,
avoiding explicit subset enumeration. In the tabular setups we study, the
approach is model-agnostic, provides both local and global views, and is
supported by theoretical results on orthogonality and L^2 convergence under
stated assumptions. On public tabular benchmarks in our environment, we
observed speedups ranging from 0.6 times (slower than TreeSHAP on a small
dataset) to 9.7 times (California), with a median approximate 3.0 times across
10 datasets, while maintaining high fidelity (R^2 between 0.81 and 0.999) and
substantial rank agreement on most datasets. Overall, STRIDE complements scalar
attribution methods by offering a structured functional perspective, enabling
novel diagnostics like 'component surgery' to quantitatively measure the impact
of specific interactions within our experimental scope.

<details>

Motivation: 解决机器学习中选择泛化能力好的模型的挑战，特别是在存在Rashomon效应（多个模型表现相似）的现实场景中，如制造过程和医疗诊断

Method: Rashomon Ensemble方法，基于模型性能和解释对多个高性能模型进行战略性选择和分组，构建多样性最大化的集成模型

Result: 在开放和专有的真实世界数据集上验证，在Rashomon比例较大的场景中实现了0.20+ AUROC的提升，并在多个实际应用中展示了稳健性和有效性

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用Rashomon效应中的模型多样性，构建了更稳健的集成模型，能够更好地应对分布偏移和未见数据的变化，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Creating models from past observations and ensuring their effectiveness on
new data is the essence of machine learning. However, selecting models that
generalize well remains a challenging task. Related to this topic, the Rashomon
Effect refers to cases where multiple models perform similarly well for a given
learning problem. This often occurs in real-world scenarios, like the
manufacturing process or medical diagnosis, where diverse patterns in data lead
to multiple high-performing solutions. We propose the Rashomon Ensemble, a
method that strategically selects models from these diverse high-performing
solutions to improve generalization. By grouping models based on both their
performance and explanations, we construct ensembles that maximize diversity
while maintaining predictive accuracy. This selection ensures that each model
covers a distinct region of the solution space, making the ensemble more robust
to distribution shifts and variations in unseen data. We validate our approach
on both open and proprietary collaborative real-world datasets, demonstrating
up to 0.20+ AUROC improvements in scenarios where the Rashomon ratio is large.
Additionally, we demonstrate tangible benefits for businesses in various
real-world applications, highlighting the robustness, practicality, and
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a
foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main
tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use
of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of
observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by
group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show
that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is
obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical
step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space
of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.

Motivation: 对大语言模型进行专业化调优时，传统LoRA方法的均匀秩分配存在限制，而现有的秩分配技术计算复杂、效率低且不稳定

Method: 提出Sensitivity-LoRA方法，利用损失函数的二阶导数（Hessian矩阵）来量化权重的全局和局部敏感性，并根据敏感性动态分配秩，以最小化计算开销

Result: 实验结果表明Sensitivity-LoRA在多种任务和测试集上都显示出稳健的效果、高效率和稳定性

Conclusion: Sensitivity-LoRA通过动态秩分配机制，有效解决了传统LoRA方法的限制，为大语言模型的高效调优提供了一种计算效率高且稳定的新方法

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed both everyday life and
scientific research. However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to
specialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to
LLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.
However, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each
incremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing
this issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering
practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose
Sensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates
ranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It
leverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to
effectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with
minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated
robust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across
diverse tasks and benchmarks.

Method: 集成多元格兰杰因果性(MVGC)和PCMCI+算法进行因果特征选择，构建混合神经网络架构，使用1979-2021年43年北极海冰范围数据及海洋-大气变量

Conclusion: 该框架虽然在北极海冰预测中录得验证，但具有广泛的适用性，能够扩展到其他动态高维预测领域，为因果驱动的预测建模提供了可扩展的方法

Abstract: Conventional machine learning and deep learning models typically rely on
correlation-based learning, which often fails to distinguish genuine causal
relationships from spurious associations, limiting their robustness,
interpretability, and ability to generalize. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates
Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection
within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic
Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily
and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential
predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary
features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that
incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and
interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE
forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic,
high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the
theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed
predictive modeling.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以处理高频或非规则时间间隔的复杂动态系统，连续时间RL虽然有望解决但局限于单智能体领域，主要受维度灾难和多智能体集中价值函数逼近困难两大挑战限制

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)近似HJB基础的价值函数，引入值梯度迭代(VGI)模块沿轨迹迭代优化值梯度，确保价值学习与值梯度学习的一致性

Result: 在连续时间版本的多智能体粒子环境和多智能体MuJoCo基准测试中，该方法持续优于现有连续时间RL基线，并能扩展到复杂多智能体动态系统

Conclusion: 提出的CT-MARL框架成功解决了连续时间多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，通过VGI模块提高了梯度保真度，实现了更准确的价值估计和更强的策略学习能力

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical
systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time
intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by
replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions
defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation.
While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the
single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i)
conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of
dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and
(ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating
centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in
turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL
framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate
HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its
differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by
introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines
value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn
yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our
method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including
multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time
RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.

Motivation: ISP之间的对等互联过程复杂耗时，自动化选择对等伙伴可以提高全球互联网生态系统的效率

Method: 利用PeeringDB、CAIDA等公开数据，评估树基模型、神经网络和Transformer三类机器学习模型，最终采用XGBoost算法

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，准确率达98%，对时间、空间变化和缺失数据具有良好鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法可帮助ISP完全自动化对等伙伴选择过程，实现更高效优化的互联网生态系统

Abstract: Internet service providers (ISPs) need to connect with other ISPs to provide
global connectivity services to their users. To ensure global connectivity,
ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering
relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering
offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often
involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection
can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of
publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that
can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public
databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we
evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting
peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based.
Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and
efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly
available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in
predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great
resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that
ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection
process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet
ecosystem.

Motivation: 虽然英语和中文的合成语音检测器发展迅速，但拥有6亿多使用者的西班牙语在语音取证领域代表性不足，需要专门的数据集来提升检测能力。

Method: 构建包含真实语音（来自公共语料库，涵盖6种口音）和合成语音（使用6种零样本TTS系统生成）的大规模西班牙语数据集HISPASpoof，并评估5种代表性检测方法。

Result: 在英语上训练的检测器无法泛化到西班牙语，而使用HISPASpoof训练能显著提升检测性能。同时评估了合成语音溯源（识别生成方法）的性能。

Conclusion: HISPASpoof为推进西班牙语可靠和包容性语音取证提供了关键基准，填补了该语言在合成语音检测领域的空白。

Abstract: Zero-shot Voice Cloning (VC) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) methods have advanced
rapidly, enabling the generation of highly realistic synthetic speech and
raising serious concerns about their misuse. While numerous detectors have been
developed for English and Chinese, Spanish-spoken by over 600 million people
worldwide-remains underrepresented in speech forensics. To address this gap, we
introduce HISPASpoof, the first large-scale Spanish dataset designed for
synthetic speech detection and attribution. It includes real speech from public
corpora across six accents and synthetic speech generated with six zero-shot
TTS systems. We evaluate five representative methods, showing that detectors
trained on English fail to generalize to Spanish, while training on HISPASpoof
substantially improves detection. We also evaluate synthetic speech attribution
performance on HISPASpoof, i.e., identifying the generation method of synthetic
speech. HISPASpoof thus provides a critical benchmark for advancing reliable
and inclusive speech forensics in Spanish.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列级RL方法在移植PPO/GRPO风格的裁剪时存在固定裁剪范围系统性地对短长响应进行不同权重处理的问题，扭曲了有效目标函数。

Method: 提出FSPO方法，采用高斯启发的解决方案：用KL校正漂移项和√L缩放的带对序列对数IS比率进行裁剪。

Result: FSPO在不同长度区间上平坦化裁剪率，稳定训练过程，在多个评估数据集上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: FSPO通过理论形式化的长度公平性和实际有效的裁剪策略，解决了序列级RL中的长度偏差问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level
reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping
directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit
sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping
is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short
vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we
formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that
small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true
updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the
sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and
scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins,
stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation
datasets.

TL;DR: 深度学习天气预测模型的当前评估指标存在"统计相似性陷阱"，奖励模糊预测而漏掉稀有高影响事件。DART框架通过双解码器结构和专门为极端对流检测优化的设计，显著提升了危险对流检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有天气预测模型评估指标存在显著缺陷，导致模型过于关注统计相似性而忽略重要的极端天气事件，影响对高影响天气的准确预测和预防能力。

Method: 提出DART框架，采用双解码器结构，进行显式的背景/极端分解，结合物理动机过采样和任务特定损失函数，将粗糕大气预报转换为高分辨率卫星亮度温度场。

Result: DART在极端对流检测上显著优于各种基线模型（CSI=0.273 vs 基线的0.00），发现移除集成水气运输可以提升检测性能270%，并通过2023年8月吉大钢洪水灾害进行了实际验证。

Conclusion: DART框架系统性地解决了混合转换-分割-降维任务的挑战，为极端天气预复提供了可靠的AI解决方案，具有训练快速、与现有流程无缝集成等优势。

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束强化学习需要在最大化回报的同时满足安全约束，但在连续控制环境中，策略优化方法在约束边界附近表现不稳定，导致训练性能不佳

Method: 引入自适应激励机制，在接近约束边界前保持约束限制，并提出IP3O算法实施渐进增加的惩罚来稳定训练动态

Result: 在基准环境上的实证评估显示，IP3O相比最先进的安全RL算法表现出更好的性能

Conclusion: IP3O算法有效解决了约束强化学习的训练稳定性问题，并提供了理论最优性误差界限保证

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to maximize the return while
adhering to predefined constraint limits, which represent domain-specific
safety requirements. In continuous control settings, where learning agents
govern system actions, balancing the trade-off between reward maximization and
constraint satisfaction remains a significant challenge. Policy optimization
methods often exhibit instability near constraint boundaries, resulting in
suboptimal training performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
approach that integrates an adaptive incentive mechanism in addition to the
reward structure to stay within the constraint bound before approaching the
constraint boundary. Building on this insight, we propose Incrementally
Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (IP3O), a practical algorithm that
enforces a progressively increasing penalty to stabilize training dynamics.
Through empirical evaluation on benchmark environments, we demonstrate the
efficacy of IP3O compared to the performance of state-of-the-art Safe RL
algorithms. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by deriving a bound
on the worst-case error of the optimality achieved by our algorithm.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and
XGBoost follow with 97% accuracy.

TL;DR: Vejde框架结合数据抽象、图神经网络和强化学习，为具有丰富结构化状态的决策问题生成归纳策略函数，能够处理不同规模和结构的问题，并在未见过的测试实例上表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有丰富结构化状态（如对象类和关系）的决策问题，传统方法难以处理变化的问题规模和结构，需要能够归纳泛化的策略函数。

Method: 使用数据抽象将MDP状态表示为实体事实数据库，转换为二分图并通过神经消息传递映射到潜在状态。结合监督学习和强化学习训练策略，使用图神经网络处理结构化表示。

Result: 在8个RDDL问题域的测试中，Vejde代理在未见过的测试实例上平均得分接近针对特定实例训练的MLP代理，且没有显著性能损失，优于在线规划算法Prost。

Conclusion: Vejde框架能够有效生成可泛化的归纳策略，处理结构化决策问题，在未见实例上表现良好，为解决复杂结构化决策问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: We present and evaluate Vejde; a framework which combines data abstraction,
graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to produce inductive policy
functions for decision problems with richly structured states, such as object
classes and relations. MDP states are represented as data bases of facts about
entities, and Vejde converts each state to a bipartite graph, which is mapped
to latent states through neural message passing. The factored representation of
both states and actions allows Vejde agents to handle problems of varying size
and structure. We tested Vejde agents on eight problem domains defined in RDDL,
with ten problem instances each, where policies were trained using both
supervised and reinforcement learning. To test policy generalization, we
separate problem instances in two sets, one for training and the other solely
for testing. Test results on unseen instances for the Vejde agents were
compared to MLP agents trained on each problem instance, as well as the online
planning algorithm Prost. Our results show that Vejde policies in average
generalize to the test instances without a significant loss in score.
Additionally, the inductive agents received scores on unseen test instances
that on average were close to the instance-specific MLP agents.

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，从大型语言模型(LLM)中提取领域知识和推理能力，辅助传统序列模型进行预测，提升模拟性能

Result: 在模拟任务和知识追踪(KT)任务上都取得了强劲的结果，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: LDSim方法成功实现了在保持高效推理的同时提升问答模拟器性能的目标，为教育推荐系统提供了更好的训练数据收集方案

Abstract: The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student
learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to
questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to
collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students,
thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from
undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two
categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation:
(1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer
the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based
on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain
knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free
methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In
contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of
slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we
propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills
domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist
prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task
and the knowledge tracing (KT) task. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MMT-FD框架能有效解决旋转机械故障诊断中的少样本和无监督学习挑战，具有高效率和强泛化能力

Abstract: The intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating mechanical equipment usually
requires a large amount of labeled sample data. However, in practical
industrial applications, acquiring enough data is both challenging and
expensive in terms of time and cost. Moreover, different types of rotating
mechanical equipment with different unique mechanical properties, require
separate training of diagnostic models for each case. To address the challenges
of limited fault samples and the lack of generalizability in prediction models
for practical engineering applications, we propose a Multi-Attention Meta
Transformer method for few-shot unsupervised rotating machinery fault diagnosis
(MMT-FD). This framework extracts potential fault representations from
unlabeled data and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, making it
suitable for diagnosing faults across various types of mechanical equipment.
The MMT-FD framework integrates a time-frequency domain encoder and a
meta-learning generalization model. The time-frequency domain encoder predicts
status representations generated through random augmentations in the
time-frequency domain. These enhanced data are then fed into a meta-learning
network for classification and generalization training, followed by fine-tuning
using a limited amount of labeled data. The model is iteratively optimized
using a small number of contrastive learning iterations, resulting in high
efficiency. To validate the framework, we conducted experiments on a bearing
fault dataset and rotor test bench data. The results demonstrate that the
MMT-FD model achieves 99\% fault diagnosis accuracy with only 1\% of labeled
sample data, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和Deep Search三个具有挑战性的代理任务上进行全面实验，EMPG实现了显著的性能提升，显著优于强策略梯度基线方法。

Conclusion: EMPG通过解耦策略梯度幅度与熵的耦合关系，有效解决了长时程任务中的信用分配问题，提高了学习效率和稳定性，为基于LLM的代理学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

Conclusion: DRSALife框架为无先验知识情况下的反应-正散系统识别提供了有效方法，在噪声和稀疏数据环境中体现了良好的性能和稳健性，为渐现动力学的数据驱动发现开启了新途径。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity,
particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are
widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology,
epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics.
A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification
when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to
address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models,
such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for
reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the
applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft
Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately
represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data.
This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game
of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is
one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning
and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior
knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive
findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy
and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we
successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results
demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics
with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to
Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.

Conclusion: MoSE框架通过灵活的子图专家混合机制，显著提升了GNN的结构表达能力和任务适应性，同时提供了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in learning
from graph-structured data, their reliance on local, pairwise message passing
restricts their ability to capture complex, high-order subgraph patterns.
leading to insufficient structural expressiveness. Recent efforts have
attempted to enhance structural expressiveness by integrating random walk
kernels into GNNs. However, these methods are inherently designed for
graph-level tasks, which limits their applicability to other downstream tasks
such as node classification. Moreover, their fixed kernel configurations hinder
the model's flexibility in capturing diverse subgraph structures. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Mixture of Subgraph Experts
(MoSE) framework for flexible and expressive subgraph-based representation
learning across diverse graph tasks. Specifically, MoSE extracts informative
subgraphs via anonymous walks and dynamically routes them to specialized
experts based on structural semantics, enabling the model to capture diverse
subgraph patterns with improved flexibility and interpretability. We further
provide a theoretical analysis of MoSE's expressivity within the Subgraph
Weisfeiler-Lehman (SWL) Test, proving that it is more powerful than SWL.
Extensive experiments, together with visualizations of learned subgraph
experts, demonstrate that MoSE not only outperforms competitive baselines but
also provides interpretable insights into structural patterns learned by the
model.

Conclusion: 该方法为HGR相关系数的计算提供了更可靠的选择，特别适合现实世界应用场景，能够产生有意义的次梯度用于机器学习正则化。

Abstract: The Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi (HGR) correlation coefficient is an extension
of Pearson's correlation that is not limited to linear correlations, with
potential applications in algorithmic fairness, scientific analysis, and causal
discovery. Recently, novel algorithms to estimate HGR in a differentiable
manner have been proposed to facilitate its use as a loss regularizer in
constrained machine learning applications. However, the inherent
uncomputability of HGR requires a bias-variance trade-off, which can possibly
compromise the robustness of the proposed methods, hence raising technical
concerns if applied in real-world scenarios. We introduce a novel computational
approach for HGR that relies on user-configurable polynomial kernels, offering
greater robustness compared to previous methods and featuring a faster yet
almost equally effective restriction. Our approach provides significant
advantages in terms of robustness and determinism, making it a more reliable
option for real-world applications. Moreover, we present a brief experimental
analysis to validate the applicability of our approach within a constrained
machine learning framework, showing that its computation yields an insightful
subgradient that can serve as a loss regularizer.

Method: 利用历史实验结果的SHAP解释，结合元学习和LLM推理，采用LLM-as-judge评估控制输出格式、准确性和完整性。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集上，MetaLLMiX性能优于传统HPO方法，计算成本大幅降低，本地部署在5/8任务上达到最优结果，响应时间减少99.6-99.9%，训练速度提升2.4-15.7倍。

Conclusion: MetaLLMiX提供了一种高效、低成本的超参数优化解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Effective model and hyperparameter selection remains a major challenge in
deep learning, often requiring extensive expertise and computation. While
AutoML and large language models (LLMs) promise automation, current LLM-based
approaches rely on trial and error and expensive APIs, which provide limited
interpretability and generalizability. We propose MetaLLMiX, a zero-shot

SHAP explanations, MetaLLMiX recommends optimal hyperparameters and pretrained
models without additional trials. We further employ an LLM-as-judge evaluation
to control output format, accuracy, and completeness. Experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets using nine open-source lightweight LLMs show that
MetaLLMiX achieves competitive or superior performance to traditional HPO
methods while drastically reducing computational cost. Our local deployment
outperforms prior API-based approaches, achieving optimal results on 5 of 8

Motivation: 研究语言模型如何通过自生成反事实解释来向人类解释其决策，以提高协作效果和可解释性。

Method: 评估LLMs生成反事实解释的有效性（是否能改变预测结果）和最小性（是否作最小编辑），在多个LLMs、数据集和评估设置下进行实验。

Result: LLMs能生成有效的反事实解释，但编辑过多而不最小；当要求最小化时，又作过小编辑而无法改变预测结果，存在明显的效果性-最小化争执。

Conclusion: 自生成反事实解释在可解释性方面效果差强或甚至会产生误导，高风险场景中部署LLMs需考虑不可靠自我解释对下游决策的影响。

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 机器学习和地统计学在土壤属性预测中各具优势但方法不同，需要结合两者优势来提升数字土壤制图的准确性和鲁棒性

Method: 开发Kriging Prior Regression (KpR)方法，通过普通克里金法生成空间滞后特征来丰富机器学习模型的空间上下文，使用TabPFN模型在六个田间尺度数据集上进行评估

Result: KpR与TabPFN结合相比其他空间技术和非空间机器学习算法（如随机森林）具有更可靠的uncertainty估计和更准确的预测，平均R2提升约30%

Conclusion: KpR与TabPFN相结合为精准农业中的数字土壤制图提供了一个非常鲁棒和通用的建模框架，特别适用于小样本量和近端土壤传感数据有限的情况

Abstract: Machine learning and geostatistics are two fundamentally different frameworks
for predicting and spatially mapping soil properties. Geostatistics leverages
the spatial structure of soil properties, while machine learning captures the
relationship between available environmental features and soil properties. We
propose a hybrid framework that enriches ML with spatial context through
engineering of 'spatial lag' features from ordinary kriging. We call this
approach 'kriging prior regression' (KpR), as it follows the inverse logic of
regression kriging. To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and
probabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six
fieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa. These datasets included soil organic carbon,
clay content, and pH, along with features derived from remote sensing and
in-situ proximal soil sensing. KpR with TabPFN demonstrated reliable
uncertainty estimates and more accurate predictions in comparison to several
other spatial techniques (e.g., regression/residual kriging with TabPFN), as
well as to established non-spatial machine learning algorithms (e.g., random
forest). Most notably, it significantly improved the average R2 by around 30%
compared to machine learning algorithms without spatial context. This
improvement was due to the strong prediction performance of the TabPFN
algorithm itself and the complementary spatial information provided by KpR
features. TabPFN is particularly effective for prediction tasks with small
sample sizes, common in precision agriculture, whereas KpR can compensate for
weak relationships between sensing features and soil properties when proximal
soil sensing data are limited. Hence, we conclude that KpR with TabPFN is a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物共现网络推断算法通常只分析单一环境中的静态关联，忽略了微生物群落在不同生态条件下的动态适应过程

Method: 使用Same-All Cross-validation (SAC)框架评估算法性能，提出fuser算法在训练时保留子样本特异性信号并跨环境共享相关信息，生成环境特异性预测网络

Result: fuser在相同环境(Same)场景中与glmnet等现有算法性能相当，在跨环境(All)场景中显著降低测试误差

Conclusion: fuser算法能够有效处理微生物群落的时空动态变化，为跨环境微生物网络推断提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Co-occurrence network inference algorithms have significantly advanced our
understanding of microbiome communities. However, these algorithms typically
analyze microbial associations within samples collected from a single
environmental niche, often capturing only static snapshots rather than dynamic
microbial processes. Previous studies have commonly grouped samples from
different environmental niches together without fully considering how microbial
communities adapt their associations when faced with varying ecological
conditions. Our study addresses this limitation by explicitly investigating
both spatial and temporal dynamics of microbial communities. We analyzed
publicly available microbiome abundance data across multiple locations and time
points, to evaluate algorithm performance in predicting microbial associations
using our proposed Same-All Cross-validation (SAC) framework. SAC evaluates
algorithms in two distinct scenarios: training and testing within the same
environmental niche (Same), and training and testing on combined data from
multiple environmental niches (All). To overcome the limitations of
conventional algorithms, we propose fuser, an algorithm that, while not
entirely new in machine learning, is novel for microbiome community network
inference. It retains subsample-specific signals while simultaneously sharing
relevant information across environments during training. Unlike standard
approaches that infer a single generalized network from combined data, fuser
generates distinct, environment-specific predictive networks. Our results
demonstrate that fuser achieves comparable predictive performance to existing
algorithms such as glmnet when evaluated within homogeneous environments
(Same), and notably reduces test error compared to baseline algorithms in
cross-environment (All) scenarios.

Result: 在4个分子数据集上达到最佳性能，控制性平均提升15.3%，同时保持高有效性和分布保真度

Conclusion: 基于分数的建模方法在离散图生成中具有实践优势，能够支持灵活的多属性分子设计

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug
discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints.
While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation
quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due
to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise
fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph
Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete
graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of
conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based
techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over
arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration
(PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test
mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in
controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and
distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of
score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for
flexible, multi-property molecular design.

TL;DR: AquaCast是一个多输入多输出深度学习模型，用于城市水动力预测，结合内源变量和外源因素，在真实和合成数据集上均优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市水动力预测的挑战，传统方法难以同时捕捉变量间和时间上的依赖关系，需要有效整合内源变量（水位、流量）和外源因素（降水历史和预报）。

Method: 开发AquaCast模型，通过嵌入层融合外源输入，避免对外源变量进行预测，专注于内源变量的预测，同时捕捉所有输入的变量间和时间依赖关系。

Conclusion: AquaCast模型能够有效整合内源和外源信息，在城市水动力预测任务中 consistently 优于现有基线方法，具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of forecasting urban water dynamics by
developing a multi-input, multi-output deep learning model that incorporates
both endogenous variables (e.g., water height or discharge) and exogenous
factors (e.g., precipitation history and forecast reports). Unlike conventional
forecasting, the proposed model, AquaCast, captures both inter-variable and
temporal dependencies across all inputs, while focusing forecast solely on
endogenous variables. Exogenous inputs are fused via an embedding layer,
eliminating the need to forecast them and enabling the model to attend to their
short-term influences more effectively. We evaluate our approach on the
LausanneCity dataset, which includes measurements from four urban drainage
sensors, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance when using only
endogenous variables. Performance also improves with the inclusion of exogenous
variables and forecast reports. To assess generalization and scalability, we
additionally test the model on three large-scale synthesized datasets,
generated from MeteoSwiss records, the Lorenz Attractors model, and the Random
Fields model, each representing a different level of temporal complexity across
100 nodes. The results confirm that our model consistently outperforms existing
baselines and maintains a robust and accurate forecast across both real and
synthetic datasets.

Result: 在不同目标函数上表现出可证明的次线性收敛率，匹配最佳可用率；实验显示在保持隐私的同时显著提升准确率

Conclusion: 动态差分隐私以隐私为代价获得更好效用，随机投影实现更高效的模型学习

Abstract: Stochastic optimization is a pivotal enabler in modern machine learning,
producing effective models for various tasks. However, several existing works
have shown that model parameters and gradient information are susceptible to
privacy leakage. Although Differentially Private SGD (DPSGD) addresses privacy
concerns, its static noise mechanism impacts the error bounds for model
performance. Additionally, with the exponential increase in model parameters,
efficient learning of these models using stochastic optimizers has become more
challenging. To address these concerns, we introduce the Dynamically
Differentially Private Projected SGD (D2P2-SGD) optimizer. In D2P2-SGD, we
combine two important ideas: (i) dynamic differential privacy (DDP) with
automatic gradient clipping and (ii) random projection with SGD, allowing
dynamic adjustment of the tradeoff between utility and privacy of the model. It
exhibits provably sub-linear convergence rates across different objective
functions, matching the best available rate. The theoretical analysis further
suggests that DDP leads to better utility at the cost of privacy, while random
projection enables more efficient model learning. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets show that D2P2-SGD remarkably enhances accuracy while
maintaining privacy. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Solutions to the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) in machine learning face
the challenge of high computational costs associated with evaluating various
algorithms' performances on a given dataset. To mitigate this cost, the
meta-learning field can leverage previously executed experiments shared in
online repositories such as OpenML. OpenML provides an extensive collection of
machine learning experiments. However, an analysis of OpenML's records reveals
limitations. It lacks diversity in pipelines, specifically when exploring data
preprocessing steps/blocks, such as scaling or imputation, resulting in limited
representation. Its experiments are often focused on a few popular techniques
within each pipeline block, leading to an imbalanced sample. To overcome the
observed limitations of OpenML, we propose PIPES, a collection of experiments
involving multiple pipelines designed to represent all combinations of the
selected sets of techniques, aiming at diversity and completeness. PIPES stores
the results of experiments performed applying 9,408 pipelines to 300 datasets.
It includes detailed information on the pipeline blocks, training and testing
times, predictions, performances, and the eventual error messages. This
comprehensive collection of results allows researchers to perform analyses
across diverse and representative pipelines and datasets. PIPES also offers
potential for expansion, as additional data and experiments can be incorporated
to support the meta-learning community further. The data, code, supplementary

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of few-shot learning for
respiratory sound classification, focusing on coughbased detection of COVID-19,
Flu, and healthy conditions. We leverage Prototypical Networks with spectrogram
representations of cough sounds to address the challenge of limited labeled
data. Our study evaluates whether few-shot learning can enable models to
achieve performance comparable to traditional deep learning approaches while
using significantly fewer training samples. Additionally, we compare
multi-class and binary classification models to assess whether multi-class
models can perform comparably to their binary counterparts. Experimental
findings show that few-shot learning models can achieve competitive accuracy.
Our model attains 74.87% accuracy in multi-class classification with only 15
support examples per class, while binary classification achieves over 70%
accuracy across all class pairs. Class-wise analysis reveals Flu as the most
distinguishable class, and Healthy as the most challenging. Statistical tests
(paired t-test p = 0.149, Wilcoxon p = 0.125) indicate no significant
performance difference between binary and multiclass models, supporting the
viability of multi-class classification in this setting. These results
highlight the feasibility of applying few-shot learning in medical diagnostics,
particularly when large labeled datasets are unavailable.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然具有分布式学习优势，但在数据异构性下容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御机制在非IID数据场景下表现不佳

Method: 使用基于梯度接近性和差异性的联合双评分系统来评估客户端梯度，采用双重视角方法促进诚实客户端间的自然相似性，同时检测可疑一致性作为攻击指标

Result: 大量数值实验表明ProDiGy在各种场景下优于现有防御方法，特别是在非IID数据分布时，其他防御机制失效时ProDiGy仍能保持强大的防御能力和模型准确性

Conclusion: 双重视角方法在拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习中具有显著效果，能够有效检测攻击并保持模型性能

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a widely studied paradigm for distributed
learning. Despite its many advantages, FL remains vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, especially under data heterogeneity. We propose a new Byzantine-robust
FL algorithm called ProDiGy. The key novelty lies in evaluating the client
gradients using a joint dual scoring system based on the gradients' proximity
and dissimilarity. We demonstrate through extensive numerical experiments that
ProDiGy outperforms existing defenses in various scenarios. In particular, when
the clients' data do not follow an IID distribution, while other defense
mechanisms fail, ProDiGy maintains strong defense capabilities and model
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of a dual perspective
approach that promotes natural similarity among honest clients while detecting
suspicious uniformity as a potential indicator of an attack.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic
spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the
underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves
pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on
a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of
parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is
capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables
computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only
a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes.
We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its
ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator
provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical
integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a
probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification,
allowing for the statistical study of rare events.

Abstract: We propose a novel data-lean operator learning algorithm, the Reduced Basis

Generative Pre-Trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks, ReBaNO relies on a
mathematically rigorous greedy algorithm to build its network structure offline
adaptively from the ground up. Knowledge distillation via task-specific
activation function allows ReBaNO to have a compact architecture requiring
minimal computational cost online while embedding physics. In comparison to
state-of-the-art operator learning algorithms such as PCA-Net, DeepONet, FNO,

them in terms of eliminating/shrinking the generalization gap for both in- and
out-of-distribution tests and being the only operator learning algorithm
achieving strict discretization invariance.

Conclusion: 提出的群体反事实解释演化分析方法为概念漂移提供了可解释的代理，实现了对模型决策逻辑变化的全面诊断和根本原因区分

Abstract: Machine learning models in dynamic environments often suffer from concept
drift, where changes in the data distribution degrade performance. While
detecting this drift is a well-studied topic, explaining how and why the
model's decision-making logic changes still remains a significant challenge. In
this paper, we introduce a novel methodology to explain concept drift by
analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations
(GCEs). Our approach tracks shifts in the GCEs' cluster centroids and their
associated counterfactual action vectors before and after a drift. These
evolving GCEs act as an interpretable proxy, revealing structural changes in
the model's decision boundary and its underlying rationale. We operationalize
this analysis within a three-layer framework that synergistically combines
insights from the data layer (distributional shifts), the model layer
(prediction disagreement), and our proposed explanation layer. We show that
such holistic view allows for a more comprehensive diagnosis of drift, making
it possible to distinguish between different root causes, such as a spatial
data shift versus a re-labeling of concepts.

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant是一种新的2位量化方法，使用可学习的蝴蝶变换替代固定Hadamard变换，通过梯度优化适应不同层的异常值模式，显著提升大语言模型在低精度量化下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转方法使用固定的Hadamard变换无法适应不同Transformer层特有的异常值模式，导致极端2位量化时性能严重下降。

Method: 提出可学习的蝴蝶变换，通过连续Givens旋转角度参数化，保证正交性同时支持梯度优化；引入均匀性正则化促进量化友好的平滑分布。

Result: 在LLaMA-2-7B模型上，2位量化的困惑度从QuaRot的22.1提升到15.4，仅需128个校准样本和单GPU几分钟训练。

Conclusion: ButterflyQuant通过层自适应的可学习正交变换，有效抑制异常值，显著改善了极端量化下的模型性能，计算复杂度为O(n log n)。

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction using deep learning (DL) models has accelerated
drug and materials discovery, but the resulting DL models often lack
interpretability, hindering their adoption by chemists. This work proposes
developing molecule representations using the concept of Functional Groups (FG)
in chemistry. We introduce the Functional Group Representation (FGR) framework,
a novel approach to encoding molecules based on their fundamental chemical
substructures. Our method integrates two types of functional groups: those
curated from established chemical knowledge (FG), and those mined from a large
molecular corpus using sequential pattern mining (MFG). The resulting FGR
framework encodes molecules into a lower-dimensional latent space by leveraging
pre-training on a large dataset of unlabeled molecules. Furthermore, the
proposed framework allows the inclusion of 2D structure-based descriptors of
molecules. We demonstrate that the FGR framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a diverse range of 33 benchmark datasets spanning physical
chemistry, biophysics, quantum mechanics, biological activity, and
pharmacokinetics while enabling chemical interpretability. Crucially, the
model's representations are intrinsically aligned with established chemical
principles, allowing chemists to directly link predicted properties to specific
functional groups and facilitating novel insights into structure-property
relationships. Our work presents a significant step toward developing
high-performing, chemically interpretable DL models for molecular discovery.

Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning
(FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds
to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm)
across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from
a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against
behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global
conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap
95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL
achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics,
demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的机器学习模型解释框架，通过视图定义来高亮关键数据库部分，解释异构图神经网络在关系数据库上的预测过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图神经网络在关系数据库上的模型复杂度高，难以人类理解其预测机制，需要可解释性方法来高亮关键数据部分。

Method: 通过视图定义来高亮数据库中对预测最关键的部分，采用全局汇溜解释方法，调节确定性与简洁性的平衡，并支持不同粒度级别的视图定义。

Result: 在RelBench数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果表明该方法能够生成有用的解释，并且具有高效的生成效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为关系数据库上的深度学习模型提供了有效的可解释性方法，通过视图定义来高亮关键数据库部分，帮助人们理解模型的预测机制。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of
deep learning models over relational databases, including architectures based
on heterogeneous graph neural networks (hetero-GNNs) and heterogeneous graph
transformers. In effect, such architectures state how the database records and
links (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical
expression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it
hard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available
data to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for
explaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where
explanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database
that mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global
abductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,
Segoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between
determinacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of
granularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones
highlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of
tuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case
of hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive
search over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are
model-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of
learnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical
study on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different
record-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
explanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的广泛部署和使用对气候产生重大影响，现有能效基准往往无法代表真实生产场景，需要收集更多关于LLM能效的信息来帮助开发者做出更可持续的选择。

Method: 引入LLM能效基准测试，使用生产就绪的高吞吐量LLM服务后端vLLM来模拟真实使用条件，考察模型大小、架构和并发请求量等因素对推理能效的影响。

Result: 研究表明可以创建更能反映实际部署条件的能效基准测试，为开发者提供了关于不同模型配置下能效表现的宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为构建更可持续的AI系统提供了实用指导，帮助开发者在LLM部署中更好地平衡性能与能效，推动绿色AI发展。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is having an growing impact on
the climate due to the substantial energy required for their deployment and
use. To create awareness for developers who are implementing LLMs in their
products, there is a strong need to collect more information about the energy
efficiency of LLMs. While existing research has evaluated the energy efficiency
of various models, these benchmarks often fall short of representing realistic
production scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the LLM Efficiency Benchmark,
designed to simulate real-world usage conditions. Our benchmark utilizes vLLM,
a high-throughput, production-ready LLM serving backend that optimizes model
performance and efficiency. We examine how factors such as model size,
architecture, and concurrent request volume affect inference energy efficiency.
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to create energy efficiency
benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment conditions, providing
valuable insights for developers aiming to build more sustainable AI systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReDef数据集，通过revert commits和GPT辅助筛选构建了高信任度的软件缺陷预测数据集，并系统评估了预训练语言模型在代码修改理解方面的能力和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的JIT-SDP数据集存在噪声标签和低精度问题，需要更可靠的数据集来支持软件缺陷预测研究。

Method: 通过revert commits标记缺陷修改，历史检查验证清洁修改，以及GPT辅助的多次投票审核过程构建高信任度数据集，并对多个PLM模型进行细调和反事实探针。

Result: 构建了3,164个缺陷修改和10,268个清洁修改，给出了更可靠的标签。结果显示diff格式编码在所有PLM中都更好，但反事实测试显示模型依赖表面线索而非真正语义理解。

Conclusion: 当前的预训练语言模型在理解代码修改方面仍有限，无法真正理解修改语义，需要更深层次的模型改进。

Abstract: Just-in-Time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) plays a critical role in
prioritizing risky code changes during code review and continuous integration.
However, existing datasets often suffer from noisy labels and low precision in
identifying bug-inducing commits. To address this, we present ReDef
(Revert-based Defect dataset), a high-confidence benchmark of function-level
modifications curated from 22 large-scale C/C++ projects. Defective cases are
anchored by revert commits, while clean cases are validated through post-hoc
history checks. Ambiguous instances are conservatively filtered out via a
GPT-assisted triage process involving multiple votes and audits. This pipeline
yields 3,164 defective and 10,268 clean modifications, offering substantially
more reliable labels than prior existing resources. Beyond dataset
construction, we provide the first systematic evaluation of how pre-trained
language models (PLMs) reason about code modifications -- specifically, which
input encodings most effectively expose change information, and whether models
genuinely capture edit semantics. We fine-tune CodeBERT, CodeT5+, and UniXcoder
under five encoding strategies, and further probe their sensitivity through
counterfactual perturbations that swap added/deleted blocks, invert diff
polarity, or inject spurious markers. Our results show that compact diff-style
encodings consistently outperform whole-function formats across all PLMs, with
statistical tests confirming large, model-independent effects. However, under
counterfactual tests, performance degrades little or not at all -- revealing
that what appears to be robustness in fact reflects reliance on superficial
cues rather than true semantic understanding. These findings indicate that,
unlike in snapshot-based tasks, current PLMs remain limited in their ability to
genuinely comprehend code modifications.

TL;DR: 通过结合大语言模型与场景基于编程范式，提出了一种更可靠的软件开发方法，在Connect4游戏实现中进行了验证，能够减少错误并提高代码质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs能大大缩短开发时间和生成组织良好的代码，但它们经常会导入重大错误且以说服力强的信心呈现错误代码，容易误导开叒者接受有缺陷的解决方案

Method: 结合LLMs与"传统"软件工程技术，采用场景基于编程（SBP）范式，这是一种事件驱动的、基于场景的软件工程方法，允许开发者注入专业知识并检查验证LLMs的输出

Result: 通过在Connect4游戏设计实现中进行案例研究，创建了一个能够战胜多个强大现有组件的高效能组件，在某些情况下还能形式验证组件的正确性

Conclusion: 结合LLMs与SBP范式的方法能够更可靠地将LLMs集成到软件开发周期中，流程化开发过程、减少错误并增强用户对关键程序属性的验证信心，且实践经验显示了该方法的易用性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for
software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex
programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce
development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and
occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on
their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce
significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence,
potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions.
  In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable
manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional''
software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of
streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to
verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we
focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven,
scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers
to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify
its outputs.
  To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used
it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were
able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong
existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the
correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights
regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our
case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this
paper.

TL;DR: LoCoBench是一个专门评估长上下文LLM在复杂软件开发场景中性能的综合基准测试，包含8000个评估场景、10种编程语言、10K到1M tokens的上下文长度范围，以及8个任务类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着支持百万tokens上下文窗口的长上下文语言模型的出现，需要专门评估这些模型在理解完整代码库、跨文件推理和保持大规模软件系统架构一致性方面的能力。现有代码评估基准主要关注单函数补全或短上下文任务，无法满足长上下文能力的评估需求。

Method: 通过5阶段流水线系统生成多样化的高质量评估场景，涵盖10种编程语言，上下文长度从10K到1M tokens。引入包含17个指标的综合评估框架，其中8个是新指标，并整合为LoCoBench Score (LCBS)。

Result: 对最先进的长上下文模型评估显示存在显著的性能差距，表明在复杂软件开发中的长上下文理解仍然是一个重要的未解决挑战。

Conclusion: LoCoBench填补了长上下文能力评估的关键空白，揭示了当前模型在复杂软件开发场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要的评估工具和方向。

Abstract: The emergence of long-context language models with context windows extending
to millions of tokens has created new opportunities for sophisticated code
understanding and software development evaluation. We propose LoCoBench, a
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context LLMs in
realistic, complex software development scenarios. Unlike existing code
evaluation benchmarks that focus on single-function completion or short-context
tasks, LoCoBench addresses the critical evaluation gap for long-context
capabilities that require understanding entire codebases, reasoning across
multiple files, and maintaining architectural consistency across large-scale
software systems. Our benchmark provides 8,000 evaluation scenarios
systematically generated across 10 programming languages, with context lengths
spanning 10K to 1M tokens, a 100x variation that enables precise assessment of
long-context performance degradation in realistic software development
settings. LoCoBench introduces 8 task categories that capture essential
long-context capabilities: architectural understanding, cross-file refactoring,
multi-session development, bug investigation, feature implementation, code
comprehension, integration testing, and security analysis. Through a 5-phase
pipeline, we create diverse, high-quality scenarios that challenge LLMs to
reason about complex codebases at unprecedented scale. We introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework with 17 metrics across 4 dimensions,
including 8 new evaluation metrics, combined in a LoCoBench Score (LCBS). Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art long-context models reveals substantial
performance gaps, demonstrating that long-context understanding in complex
software development represents a significant unsolved challenge that demands
more attention. LoCoBench is released at:

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: 基于物理约束的激光波形反法框架，通过在损失函数中集成波动方程约束，提升了神经网络算子反法的准确性和稳定性，减少噪声和伪影


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完整波形反法(FWI)在高分辨率地下模型重构中至关重要，但受限于计算成本高、空间缺失导致分辨率低、反法结果噪声大等问题，尤其在实时应用中面临挑战

Method: 提出一种新的物理信息导向的FWI框架，在损失函数中集成物理约束项（波动方程），而不仅依赖L2范数目标函数。从初始模型出发模拟波场，然后评估波场遵循物理法则的程度以及与录制数据的匹配度

Result: 在OpenFWI和Overthrust模型上的数值实验证明，该方法在性能上显著优于普通方法，能够提供更清洁、更准确的地下速度模型，减少了噪声和伪影

Conclusion: 该方法在保持神经网络算子FWI效率的同时，显著提升了反法的准确性和稳定性，为FWI在实时地下监测中的实际应用提供了重要进展

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is crucial for reconstructing high-resolution
subsurface models, but it is often hindered, considering the limited data, by
its null space resulting in low-resolution models, and more importantly, by its
computational cost, especially if needed for real-time applications. Recent
attempts to accelerate FWI using learned wavefield neural operators have shown
promise in efficiency and differentiability, but typically suffer from noisy
and unstable inversion performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
a novel physics-informed FWI framework to enhance the inversion in accuracy
while maintaining the efficiency of neural operator-based FWI. Instead of
relying only on the L2 norm objective function via automatic differentiation,
resulting in noisy model reconstruction, we integrate a physics constraint term
in the loss function of FWI, improving the quality of the inverted velocity
models. Specifically, starting with an initial model to simulate wavefields and
then evaluating the loss over how much the resulting wavefield obeys the
physical laws (wave equation) and matches the recorded data, we achieve a
reduction in noise and artifacts. Numerical experiments using the OpenFWI and
Overthrust models demonstrate our method's superior performance, offering
cleaner and more accurate subsurface velocity than vanilla approaches.
Considering the efficiency of the approach compared to FWI, this advancement
represents a significant step forward in the practical application of FWI for
real-time subsurface monitoring.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的音频深度伪造检测评估框架，通过统合多样性真实语音数据集和平衡EER评估来提高检测模型的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频深度伪造检测评估存在两大问题：一是使用单一EER指标会因合成器样本数量不均而导致偏差；二是真实语音数据类型单一，无法模拟实际场景。

Method: 提出"bona fide cross-testing"评估框架，整合多样性真实语音数据集，并通过聚合多个EER值来进行更平衡的性能评估。

Result: 在9种不同真实语音类型上对超150余个合成器进行了基准测试，并发布了新的数据集以促进进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该方法相比传统评估方法更具稳健性和可解释性，能够更准确地评估音频深度伪造检测模型在实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new
dataset to facilitate further research at

Motivation: 解决零样本文本转语音中现有方法推理速度慢、存在重复伪影的问题，充分利用离散表示的优势，避免将离散token嵌入连续空间的做法

Method: 采用纯离散流匹配方法，在紧凑统一架构中显式建模分解的语音属性，利用上下文学习条件化文本内容和参考语音的韵律声学属性，使用分解流预测机制分别处理韵律和声学细节

Result: 在自然度、韵律、说话人风格保持和能量控制等多个关键指标上表现优异，模型尺寸紧凑，推理延迟低，生成速度比最新基线快25.8倍

Conclusion: DiFlow-TTS证明了纯离散流匹配在语音合成中的有效性，为高效高质量的零样本TTS提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架结合设备感知特征对齐和测试时设备标签利用，有效提升了低复杂度音频场景分类系统的设备鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: In this technical report, we describe our submission for Task 1,
Low-Complexity Device-Robust Acoustic Scene Classification, of the DCASE 2025
Challenge. Our work tackles the dual challenges of strict complexity
constraints and robust generalization to both seen and unseen devices, while
also leveraging the new rule allowing the use of device labels at test time.
Our proposed system is based on a knowledge distillation framework where an
efficient CP-MobileNet student learns from a compact, specialized two-teacher
ensemble. This ensemble combines a baseline PaSST teacher, trained with
standard cross-entropy, and a 'generalization expert' teacher. This expert is
trained using our novel Device-Aware Feature Alignment (DAFA) loss, adapted
from prior work, which explicitly structures the feature space for device
robustness. To capitalize on the availability of test-time device labels, the
distilled student model then undergoes a final device-specific fine-tuning
stage. Our proposed system achieves a final accuracy of 57.93\% on the
development set, demonstrating a significant improvement over the official
baseline, particularly on unseen devices.

TL;DR: NeuCodec是一种基于有限标量量化(FSQ)的神经音频编解码器，相比传统的残差向量量化(RVQ)方法，FSQ具有训练简化、天然支持单码本的特点，并且在噪声信道传输中表现出更好的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经音频编解码器大多依赖残差向量量化(RVQ)，而有限标量量化(FSQ)作为一种新兴的替代方案，能够简化训练过程并天然支持单码本。研究者希望探索FSQ在音频编码中的潜力，特别是在噪声信道传输环境下的鲁棒性优势。

Method: 提出了NeuCodec，一种基于FSQ的神经音频编解码器。通过编码器蒸馏实验验证不同编码器可以学习将相同音频编码为完全不同但质量相当的码序列。通过模拟噪声信道传输，比较RVQ和FSQ编解码器在比特级扰动下的鲁棒性表现。

Result: 实验表明FSQ编码具有内置冗余特性，在噪声信道传输中表现出色。两个不同的编码器能够学习产生完全不同的码序列但保持相同的重建质量。FSQ在比特级扰动鲁棒性方面显著优于RVQ。

Conclusion: FSQ为基础的NeuCodec编解码器在保持音频重建质量的同时，提供了更好的噪声信道传输鲁棒性，为实际应用中的音频传输提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Audio Codecs (NACs) have become increasingly adopted in speech
processing tasks due to their excellent rate-distortion performance and
compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) as discrete feature
representations for audio generation. While most existing codecs rely on
Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has
recently emerged as a compelling alternative that simplifies training and
natively supports single codebooks. We introduce NeuCodec, an FSQ-based NAC,
and show that FSQ encodes baked-in redundancy which produces an encoding which
is robust when transmitted through noisy channels. First, through an encoder
distillation experiment, we show that two different encoders can learn to
encode identical audio into vastly different code sequences whilst maintaining
comparable reconstruction quality with the same quantizer and decoder. Second,
we demonstrate that FSQ has vastly superior bit-level perturbation robustness
by comparing the performance of RVQ and FSQ codecs when simulating the
transmission of code sequences through a noisy channel.

accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

### [205] [WarpPINN-fibers: improved cardiac strain estimation from cine-MR with physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08872)
*Felipe Álvarez Barrientos,Tomás Banduc,Isabeau Sirven,Francisco Sahli Costabal*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: WarpPINN-fibers是一个基于物理信息神经网络的新框架，通过整合纤维信息来准确估计心脏运动和应变，改进了传统方法忽略纤维力学的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏收缩运动受纤维分布影响很大，传统应变分析方法缺乏纤维力学模型，无法准确解释心脏功能。需要开发能够整合纤维信息的更精确心脏运动分析方法。

Method: 使用物理信息神经网络框架，构建包含三个损失项的损失函数：数据相似性损失、近不可压缩性正则化项和纤维拉伸惩罚项，从cine MRI图像预测心脏变形场。

Result: 在合成幻影实验中改进了原有WarpPINN模型并有效控制纤维拉伸，在15名健康志愿者的cine-MRI基准测试中，在标志点跟踪和应变曲线预测方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过准确的变形场实现更精确的心脏应变量化，且与纤维生理学一致，无需比MRI更复杂的成像技术。

Abstract: The contractile motion of the heart is strongly determined by the
distribution of the fibers that constitute cardiac tissue. Strain analysis
informed with the orientation of fibers allows to describe several pathologies
that are typically associated with impaired mechanics of the myocardium, such
as cardiovascular disease. Several methods have been developed to estimate
strain-derived metrics from traditional imaging techniques. However, the
physical models underlying these methods do not include fiber mechanics,
restricting their capacity to accurately explain cardiac function. In this
work, we introduce WarpPINN-fibers, a physics-informed neural network framework
to accurately obtain cardiac motion and strains enhanced by fiber information.
We train our neural network to satisfy a hyper-elastic model and promote fiber
contraction with the goal to predict the deformation field of the heart from
cine magnetic resonance images. For this purpose, we build a loss function
composed of three terms: a data-similarity loss between the reference and the
warped template images, a regularizer enforcing near-incompressibility of
cardiac tissue and a fiber-stretch penalization that controls strain in the
direction of synthetically produced fibers. We show that our neural network
improves the former WarpPINN model and effectively controls fiber stretch in a
synthetic phantom experiment. Then, we demonstrate that WarpPINN-fibers
outperforms alternative methodologies in landmark-tracking and strain curve
prediction for a cine-MRI benchmark with a cohort of 15 healthy volunteers. We
expect that our method will enable a more precise quantification of cardiac
strains through accurate deformation fields that are consistent with fiber
physiology, without requiring imaging techniques more sophisticated than MRI.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 将虚拟染色技术扩展到X射线领域，通过跨模态图像转换从同步辐射微CT扫描生成人工染色切片，提高3D X射线成像的生化特异性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D X射线组织学技术缺乏生化特异性的问题，传统X射线断层扫描的灰度图像对比度限制了其与传统组织学染色相比的生化特异性

Method: 使用50多对共配准的微CT和甲苯胺蓝染色组织学图像对，训练改进的CycleGAN网络，包含像素级监督和灰度一致性项，采用基于补丁的训练和实时数据增强

Result: 在SSIM、PSNR和LPIPS指标上优于Pix2Pix和标准CycleGAN基线，能够生成组织学真实的彩色输出并保持高分辨率结构细节

Conclusion: 该研究将虚拟染色引入3D X射线成像，为生物医学研究提供了一种可扩展的、化学信息丰富的无标记组织表征方法，但需要更多训练数据和进一步改进

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出动态结构参数并整合到多模态深度学习框架中，用于预测特发性全层黄斑裂孔患者术后视力恢复情况


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏对术后恢复过程的动态监测，需要开发能够整合多时间点信息和动态参数的新型预测模型

Method: 使用公开纵向OCT数据集，开发阶段特异性分割模型提取定量、复合、定性和动态特征，构建包含和不含动态参数的逻辑回归模型，并开发结合临床变量、OCT特征和原始图像的多模态深度学习模型

Result: 分割模型准确率高（平均Dice > 0.89），动态恢复率显著提升逻辑回归AUC，多模态DL模型在所有阶段均优于逻辑回归，AUC差异最高达0.12

Conclusion: 整合动态参数到多模态DL模型中显著提高了预测准确性，这一全自动化流程有望成为黄斑裂孔手术个性化术后管理的有前景的临床决策支持工具

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

TL;DR: 提出基于查找表(LUT)的环路滤波框架LUT-ILF++，通过预计算DNN输出并缓存到LUT中，替代复杂的神经网络推理，在保持编码性能的同时大幅降低计算复杂度和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络环路滤波虽然编码性能优异，但计算复杂度和硬件需求高，难以广泛应用。需要一种既保持性能优势又降低复杂度的实用解决方案。

Method: 1) 训练受限参考范围的DNN并预计算所有可能输入输出缓存到LUT；2) 提出多种滤波LUT协作和定制索引机制；3) 跨分量索引机制；4) LUT压缩方案降低存储成本。

Result: 在VVC参考软件中实现，AI配置下平均节省0.82%/2.97%/1.63%码率，RA配置下节省0.85%/4.11%/2.06%码率，相比DNN方案显著降低时间复杂度和存储成本。

Conclusion: LUT-ILF++框架成功解决了神经网络环路滤波的高复杂度问题，在保持编码性能的同时实现了实用化的低复杂度解决方案，适合下一代视频编码标准应用。

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.

TL;DR: 本文研究了梯度下降等一阶方法的优化曲线凸性条件，发现在凸L-光滑函数上，当步长η≤1.75/L时优化曲线保持凸性，且该阈值是紧的。

Motivation: 探索一阶优化方法中优化曲线的凸性条件，连接离散和连续动力学分析，完善凸优化理论工具箱。

Method: 通过理论分析梯度下降在凸L-光滑函数上的行为，研究优化曲线凸性与步长的关系，并与连续时间梯度流进行对比。

Result: 发现梯度下降在η≤1.75/L时优化曲线保持凸性，梯度范数在η≤2/L时单调递减，而连续时间梯度流总是保持凸性。

Conclusion: 该研究为凸优化提供了新的理论洞察，建立了离散和连续动力学之间的联系，并给出了精确的步长阈值。

Abstract: We study when the \emph{optimization curve} of first-order methods -- the
sequence \${f(x\_n)}*{n\ge0}\$ produced by constant-stepsize iterations -- is
convex, equivalently when the forward differences \$f(x\_n)-f(x*{n+1})\$ are
nonincreasing. For gradient descent (GD) on convex \$L\$-smooth functions, the
curve is convex for all stepsizes \$\eta \le 1.75/L\$, and this threshold is
tight. Moreover, gradient norms are nonincreasing for all \$\eta \le 2/L\$, and
in continuous time (gradient flow) the curve is always convex. These results
complement and refine the classical smooth convex optimization toolbox,
connecting discrete and continuous dynamics as well as worst-case analyses.

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成引擎优化(GEO)新范式，通过大规模对比实验发现AI搜索系统相比传统搜索引擎更偏向权威第三方内容，并提供了具体的GEO实施策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI搜索引擎的兴起正在重塑信息检索方式，从传统排名列表转向合成式答案，这挑战了现有的SEO实践，需要新的优化范式

Method: 通过跨多个垂直领域、语言和查询改写的大规模受控实验，对AI搜索和传统网络搜索进行定量比较分析

Result: AI搜索系统对第三方权威内容(Earned media)存在系统性偏好，与谷歌更平衡的内容来源形成鲜明对比；不同AI搜索服务在域名多样性、新鲜度、跨语言稳定性和措辞敏感性方面差异显著

Conclusion: 提出了生成引擎优化(GEO)战略议程，为从业者提供可操作指导，包括内容工程化、主导权威媒体、采用引擎特定策略等，为生成式搜索环境中的可见性提供基础框架

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过概述嫉妒自由性在经济学和推荐系统中的应用，分析其在个性化环境中的局限性

Result: 作者论证了嫉妒自由性概念在个性化推荐系统中衡量公平性的不适当性

Conclusion: 在个性化发挥重要作用的场景中，嫉妒自由性不应作为公平性的衡量标准

Abstract: Envy-freeness and the relaxation to Envy-freeness up to one item (EF-1) have
been used as fairness concepts in the economics, game theory, and social choice
literatures since the 1960s, and have recently gained popularity within the
recommendation systems communities. In this short position paper we will give
an overview of envy-freeness and its use in economics and recommendation
systems; and illustrate why envy is not appropriate to measure fairness for use
in settings where personalization plays a role.

Motivation: 无线电规范领域具有法律敏感性和高风险特征，需要准确可靠的问题回答方案。当前缺乏专门的评估标准和有效的技术方案，需要为这个领域开发专门的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种电信专用的检索增强生成(RAG)管道，通过自动过滤和人工验证从权威来源构建了多选题评估集，并定义了领域专用的检索评量指标。

Result: 检索器在领域专用指标下达到约97%的准确率。在生成质量方面，该方法在所有测试模型上都持续提升了准确率，特别是对GPT-4o模型带来了12%的相对收益，而简单插入文档只有不到1%的收益。

Conclusion: 细心设计的基础基础提供了一种简单但强大的基准方案，是规范问题回答领域的有效专门解决方案，为该领域的研究和应用提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视Xavier Amatriain 2011年对推荐系统研究的批评，指出该领域在概念、认识论和基础设施方面的失败仍然存在，需要从根本上重新思考研究的目的、服务对象和知识生产方式。

Method: 通过分析可重复性研究、评估方法学、环境影响和参与式设计等领域的最新工作，展示推荐系统研究的复杂性已经超过了其自省能力，并强调社区主导的范式转变倡议。

Result: 研究发现推荐系统研究领域虽然在技术上越来越复杂，但根本性的方法论问题仍未解决，需要从技术改革转向更深层次的范式重构。

Conclusion: 有意义的变革不仅需要新的指标或更好的工具，还需要从根本上重新定义推荐系统研究的目的、服务对象和知识生产验证方式，建立基于认知谦逊、人类影响和可持续实践的研究议程。

Abstract: In 2011, Xavier Amatriain sounded the alarm: recommender systems research was
"doing it all wrong" [1]. His critique, rooted in statistical misinterpretation
and methodological shortcuts, remains as relevant today as it was then. But
rather than correcting course, we added new layers of sophistication on top of
the same broken foundations. This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and
argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural
failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms. Drawing
on recent work in reproducibility, evaluation methodology, environmental
impact, and participatory design, we showcase how the field's accelerating
complexity has outpaced its introspection. We highlight ongoing community-led
initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation
frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the
same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics
or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems
research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated.
Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems
research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable
practice.

Abstract: A sleep forecast allows individuals and healthcare providers to anticipate
and proactively address factors influencing restful rest, ultimately improving
mental and physical well-being. This work presents an adaptive spatial and
temporal model (AdaST-Sleep) for predicting sleep scores. Our proposed model
combines convolutional layers to capture spatial feature interactions between
multiple features and recurrent neural network layers to handle longer-term
temporal health-related data. A domain classifier is further integrated to
generalize across different subjects. We conducted several experiments using
five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 days) and five predicting window sizes
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9 days). Our approach consistently outperformed four baseline
models, achieving its lowest RMSE (0.282) with a seven-day input window and a
one-day predicting window. Moreover, the method maintained strong performance
even when forecasting multiple days into the future, demonstrating its
versatility for real-world applications. Visual comparisons reveal that the
model accurately tracks both the overall sleep score level and daily
fluctuations. These findings prove that the proposed framework provides a
robust and adaptable solution for personalized sleep forecasting using sparse
data from commercial wearable devices and domain adaptation techniques.

Motivation: 临床需要综合分析多种生理信号来监测血流动力学，但现有研究多集中于单信号分析，缺乏适用于实际临床复杂场景的多信号分析方法。

Method: 基于自监督学习的掩码表示学习方法，通过恢复三种被掩码的生理信号（ECG、PPG、ABP）来提取反映心动周期电学、压力和流体特性的生理特征。

Result: 在低血压、每搏输出量、收缩压、舒张压和年龄预测等临床下游任务中，SNUPHY-M显著优于监督学习或单信号SSL模型，特别是在使用无创信号的预测任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SNUPHY-M是首个将多模态自监督学习应用于心血管分析（涉及ECG、PPG和ABP信号）的模型，有效支持临床决策和精准诊断，为无创血流动力学的早期诊断和管理做出重要贡献。

Abstract: In clinical settings, monitoring hemodynamics is crucial for managing patient
prognosis, necessitating the integrated analysis of multiple physiological
signals. While recent research has analyzed single signals such as
electrocardiography (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG), there has yet to be a
proposal for an approach that encompasses the complex signal analysis required
in actual clinical scenarios. In this study, we introduce the SNUPHY-M (Seoul
National University hospital PHYsiological signal Masked representation
learning) model extracts physiological features reflecting the electrical,
pressure, and fluid characteristics of the cardiac cycle in the process of
restoring three masked physiological signals based on self-supervised learning
(SSL): ECG, PPG, and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. By employing
multiple physical characteristics, the model can extract more enriched features
only using non-invasive signals. We evaluated the model's performance in
clinical downstream tasks such as hypotension, stroke volume, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and age prediction. Our results showed that
the SNUPHY-M significantly outperformed supervised or SSL models, especially in
prediction tasks using non-invasive signals. To the best of our knowledge,
SNUPHY-M is the first model to apply multi-modal SSL to cardiovascular analysis
involving ECG, PPG, and ABP signals. This approach effectively supports
clinical decision-making and enables precise diagnostics, contributing
significantly to the early diagnosis and management of hemodynamics without
invasiveness.

Method: 首先在六个分辨率下检查CBCT散射信号的下采样-上采样重建误差，比较四种插值方法；然后在五个图像分辨率上训练最先进的方法，评估FLOPs、推理时间和GPU内存需求的减少。

Result: 输入大小和网络参数的减少实现了78倍的FLOPs降低，MAPE从4.42%降至3.85%，MSE从2.01×10⁻²降至1.34×10⁻²，推理时间和GPU内存使用分别减少16倍和12倍，在模拟数据集和真实CBCT扫描上验证了方法的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了降采样在深度学习散射估计中被低估的作用，方法显著降低了计算资源需求，使散射校正能够在资源受限环境（如移动CBCT和边缘设备）中实现。

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显示器测量方法无法捕捉空间变化的显示异常，而相机测量又引入光学和光度歧变，需要结合人眼视觉系统进行感知评估

Method: 开发CameraVDP框架，结合HDR图像堆叠、MTF逆变换、暗角校正、几何变形校正、色彩校正等相机重建技术，并集成视觉差异预测器(VDP)模拟人眼可见性

Result: 通过缺陷像素检测、色彩效应识别和显示均匀性评估三个应用验证框架有效性，不确定性分析框架能估算理论性能上限和质量信心区间

Conclusion: CameraVDP框架能够将相机测量转换为精确的显示器评估工具，通过结合人眼视觉模型实现对显示异常可见性的感知评估

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

Motivation: 解决复杂域上偏微分方程的科学机器学习关键挑战，其中弯曲几何使得微分算子所需的函数及其导数逼近变得复杂。

Method: 使用有界权重的常数深度ReLU^{k-1}网络，证明其可以逼近Sobolev空间函数，并引入VC维和伪维的新估计来证明下界。

Result: 网络可以用O(ε^{-d/(k-s)})个非零参数达到ε逼近误差，该速率仅依赖于内在维度d，克服了维度灾难，且构造近乎最优。

Conclusion: 该分析为学习涉及导数的流形上PDE提供了理论基础，揭示了网络架构利用稀疏结构有效利用流形的低维几何特性。

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry
complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by
differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous
approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a
constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property
that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate
any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an
error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for
$k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero
parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only
on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in
H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound,
proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of
parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound
introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and
pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These
complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on
manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network
architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's
low-dimensional geometry.

Motivation: 神经网络方法在求解偏微分方程方面表现良好，如物理信息神经网络和深度Ritz方法。本文旨在探索使用神经网络解决无限维全变差最小化问题，但发现原始问题存在理论缺陷。

Method: 提出辅助神经网络问题来规避原始问题无解的理论问题，证明其Γ-收敛到原问题；进一步提出离散版本的辅助神经网络问题，并证明其Γ-收敛性；建立离散问题与有限差分离散化之间的联系。

Conclusion: 通过引入辅助问题和离散化策略，成功解决了神经网络在全变差最小化问题中的理论缺陷，为神经网络在优化问题中的应用提供了理论保证和实用方法。

Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve
partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like
physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular.
In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional
total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that
the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To
circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network
problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense
of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical
solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network
problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original
infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof
suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we
connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference
discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization
problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical
findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统通过OCEAN人格模型实现零样本个性化，但面临心理对齐与人口统计公平性之间的冲突，需要量化评估这种权衡

Method: 提出PerFairX评估框架，使用中性和人格敏感提示，在MovieLens和Last.fm数据集上测试ChatGPT和DeepSeek两种LLM

Result: 人格感知提示显著改善个体特质对齐但加剧群体公平性差距；DeepSeek心理拟合更强但对提示变化更敏感；ChatGPT输出更稳定但个性化程度较低

Conclusion: PerFairX为开发既公平又心理感知的LLM推荐系统提供原则性基准，有助于构建包容性用户中心AI应用

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has
enabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based
interactions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.
However, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a
critical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring
demographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified
evaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between
personalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using
neutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we
benchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens
10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that
personality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual
traits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.
Specifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher
sensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less
personalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the
development of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and
psychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,
user-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.

<details>

Motivation: 分析大数据分析和AI如何通过黑盒问题威胁隐私保护，特别是在判断和行动的正当性方面

Method: 提出三种不透明性分类：浅层不透明（用户不知系统作用）、标准黑盒不透明（分析师不知系统作用）、深层不透明（分析师无法预知系统可能行为）

Result: 在存在不透明性的情况下，数据主体和分析师都无法提供保护隐私所需的正当性判断，如知情同意或匿名性保证

Conclusion: 大数据分析加剧了隐私问题并削弱了补救措施的有效性，但文章最后简要展望了处理这种情况的技术方法

Abstract: It is known that big data analytics and AI pose a threat to privacy, and that
some of this is due to some kind of "black box problem" in AI. I explain how
this becomes a problem in the context of justification for judgments and
actions. Furthermore, I suggest distinguishing three kinds of opacity: 1) the
subjects do not know what the system does ("shallow opacity"), 2) the analysts
do not know what the system does ("standard black box opacity"), or 3) the
analysts cannot possibly know what the system might do ("deep opacity"). If the
agents, data subjects as well as analytics experts, operate under opacity, then
these agents cannot provide justifications for judgments that are necessary to
protect privacy, e.g., they cannot give "informed consent", or guarantee
"anonymity". It follows from these points that agents in big data analytics and
AI often cannot make the judgments needed to protect privacy. So I conclude
that big data analytics makes the privacy problems worse and the remedies less
effective. As a positive note, I provide a brief outlook on technical ways to
handle this situation.

Abstract: There is an increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in safety-critical
applications, yet practical schemes for certifying that AI systems are safe,
lawful and socially acceptable remain scarce. This white paper presents the
T\"UV AUSTRIA Trusted AI framework an end-to-end audit catalog and methodology
for assessing and certifying machine learning systems. The audit catalog has
been in continuous development since 2019 in an ongoing collaboration with
scientific partners. Building on three pillars - Secure Software Development,
Functional Requirements, and Ethics & Data Privacy - the catalog translates the
high-level obligations of the EU AI Act into specific, testable criteria. Its
core concept of functional trustworthiness couples a statistically defined
application domain with risk-based minimum performance requirements and
statistical testing on independently sampled data, providing transparent and
reproducible evidence of model quality in real-world settings. We provide an
overview of the functional requirements that we assess, which are oriented on
the lifecycle of an AI system. In addition, we share some lessons learned from
the practical application of the audit catalog, highlighting common pitfalls we
encountered, such as data leakage scenarios, inadequate domain definitions,
neglect of biases, or a lack of distribution drift controls. We further discuss
key aspects of certifying AI systems, such as robustness, algorithmic fairness,
or post-certification requirements, outlining both our current conclusions and
a roadmap for future research. In general, by aligning technical best practices
with emerging European standards, the approach offers regulators, providers,
and users a practical roadmap for legally compliant, functionally trustworthy,
and certifiable AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文报告了在EFL教育中尝试使用vibe coding（通过自然语言与AI协作创建软件应用）的初步实践，提出了人工智能元语言框架，并通过两个学生案例对比显示了不同的vibe coding效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在英语作为外语教育中的应用潜力，通过vibe coding技术让学生能够使用自然语言与AI协作开发解决真实写作问题的应用程序。

Method: 采用逆向设计原则开发四小时工作坊，使用案例研究方法，收集工作表、视频录音、声思协议、屏幕录制和AI生成图像等数据。

Result: 两个对比案例显示了不同的vibe coding效果：一名学生成功开发了符合设计意图的功能性应用，而另一名遇到技术困难且实际功能与预期存在巨大差距。分析显示学生在提示工程、AI心智模型和作者权归属方面的差异。

Conclusion: AI可作为有益的语言机器，而vibe coding效果的差异受学生如何与AI交互的方式影响。有效的vibe coding教学需要明确的元语言脚手架支持，教授结构化提示工程技巧，促进关于作者权的批判性讨论，以及发展表达AI心智模型的词汇。

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大学教育中学术支持时间不灵活、多数学生在课外时间无法获得帮助的问题，通过LLM技术来帮助学生在任何时间获得学习支持

Method: 在三所机构的6门计算机科学课程中部署LLM课程助手系统，收集分2000名学生的使用数据，对每门课程抽样200个对话进行手动标注分析

Result: 系统在晚上和夜间使用率高，初级课程使用更活跃；大部分回复被评为正确有用，但少数有错误；只有11%对话包含LLM生成的追问问题，而且高级课程学生常忽略这些问题；LLM在生成高阶认知问题方面有限制

Conclusion: LLM教育助手在补充时间空缺和支持初学者方面有效，但需要教育者更多参与系统配置、提示词设计和政策制定，以提升在高阶思维培养和探究式学习方面的效果

Abstract: Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge
at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside
scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this
gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by
educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed
across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and
understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been
deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three
institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong
in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating
that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs.
We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled
responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or
erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an
inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations
contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by
students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current
LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions.
These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based
educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts,
content, and policies.

Motivation: 当前LLM对齐技术主要反映窄群体的规范偏好，将其价值观强加给广大用户，导致知识生产和管理权力向已有影响力机构集中

Method: 提出以下三个特征的去中心化对齐框架：1）语境（Context）-明确使用场景；2）多元性（Pluralism）-包容不同价值观；3）参与性（Participation）-广泛参与

Result: 通过具体用例展示了这三种特征在实践中的应用，并证明了不同使用语境下对齐要求的细微差异

Conclusion: LLM对齐可作为对抗认知不公和民主流衰的潜在场域，但仅靠这些策略无法替代更广泛的社会变革

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods have been credited with the
commercial success of products like ChatGPT, given their role in steering LLMs
towards user-friendly outputs. However, current alignment techniques
predominantly mirror the normative preferences of a narrow reference group,
effectively imposing their values on a wide user base. Drawing on theories of
the power/knowledge nexus, this work argues that current alignment practices
centralise control over knowledge production and governance within already
influential institutions. To counter this, we propose decentralising alignment
through three characteristics: context, pluralism, and participation.
Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the critical importance of delineating the
context-of-use when shaping alignment practices by grounding each of these
features in concrete use cases. This work makes the following contributions:
(1) highlighting the role of context, pluralism, and participation in
decentralising alignment; (2) providing concrete examples to illustrate these
strategies; and (3) demonstrating the nuanced requirements associated with
applying alignment across different contexts of use. Ultimately, this paper
positions LLM alignment as a potential site of resistance against epistemic
injustice and the erosion of democratic processes, while acknowledging that
these strategies alone cannot substitute for broader societal changes.

Motivation: 人工智能在通信基础设施中的集成引入了算法偏见和系统行为不可预测等新风险，这些风险超出了传统网络安全和数据保护框架的范围，需要作为独立的监管关注点。

Method: 使用印度作为案例研究，分析其关键数字规定，包括《通信法案》2023年、CERT-In规则和《数字个人数据保护法》2023年，并检查现有AI事故归档库的限制。

Result: 分析显示印度现有法律工具主要关注网络安全和数据泄漏，在AI特定运营事故（如性能降级和算法偏见）方面存在重大监管空白。同时识别了报告障碍和现有归档库的不足。

Conclusion: 论文提出了针对性政策建议，包括强制报告高风险AI故障、指定现有政府机构作为主管机构管理事故数据，以及开发标准化报告框架。这些建议为其他国家经营现有行业框架内管理AI风险提供了可复制的蓝图。

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications
infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and
unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional
cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise
definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents,
establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond
conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their
recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for
jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's
key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal
instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and
the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data
breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational
incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also
examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI
incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted
policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into
India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting
for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal
agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting
frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and
strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint
for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral
frameworks.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, large graphs represent relationships among entities
in complex systems. Mining these large graphs often containing millions of
nodes and edges helps uncover structural patterns and meaningful insights.
Dividing a large graph into smaller subgraphs facilitates complex system
analysis by revealing local information. Community detection extracts clusters
or communities of graphs based on statistical methods and machine learning
models using various optimization techniques. Structure based community
detection methods are more suitable for applying to graphs because they do not
rely heavily on rich node or edge attribute information. The features derived
from these communities can improve downstream graph mining tasks, such as link
prediction and node classification. In real-world applications, we often lack
ground truth community information. Additionally, there is neither a
universally accepted gold standard for community detection nor a single method
that is consistently optimal across diverse applications. In many cases, it is
unclear how practitioners select community detection methods, and choices are
often made without explicitly considering their potential impact on downstream
tasks. In this study, we investigate whether the choice of community detection
algorithm significantly influences the performance of downstream applications.
We propose a framework capable of integrating various community detection
methods to systematically evaluate their effects on downstream task outcomes.
Our comparative analysis reveals that specific community detection algorithms
yield superior results in certain applications, highlighting that method
selection substantially affects performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RIME算法在优化过程中存在种群多样性快速损失、易陷入局部最优以及开发与探索能力不平衡的问题，需要改进以提升优化性能。

Method: 采用三种策略：1）软霜搜索阶段引入协方差学习策略；2）硬霜穿刺机制中加入平均引导策略；3）提出新的停滞指标并使用随机协方差学习策略更新停滞个体。

Conclusion: MRIME-CD算法通过多种改进策略有效增强了RIME算法的全局搜索能力和跳出局部最优的能力，显著提升了优化性能。

Abstract: Metaheuristics are widely applied for their ability to provide more efficient
solutions. The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based
metaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid
loss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into
local optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address
the shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance
learning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three
strategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning
strategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population
diversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the
bootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the
tendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early
search stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the
hard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the
weighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search
ability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is
proposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the
stagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus
enhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed
MRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test
set, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the
Friedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的教育竞争优化算法IECO-MCO，通过引入多协方差学习算子来解决原ECO算法在开发和探索之间不平衡、易陷入局部最优的问题，在标准测试函数和实际约束优化问题上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育竞争优化算法(ECO)存在开发和探索不平衡的问题，容易陷入局部最优，在处理复杂优化问题时效果有限，需要改进算法性能。

Method: 提出了增强的教育竞争优化算法IECO-MCO，引入了三种不同的协方差学习算子来改进ECO算法，每个算子都能有效平衡开发和探索，防止种群过早收敛。

Result: 在CEC 2017和CEC 2022测试套件上的实验表明，IECO-MCO在收敛速度、稳定性和避免局部最优能力方面都优于基础ECO算法和其他竞争算法，平均排名分别为2.213和2.488。统计分析和实际约束优化问题验证了算法的优越性。

Conclusion: IECO-MCO算法在处理复杂优化问题时表现出优异的性能，证明了其在现实世界场景中的鲁棒性和实际有效性。

Abstract: The educational competition optimizer is a recently introduced metaheuristic
algorithm inspired by human behavior, originating from the dynamics of
educational competition within society. Nonetheless, ECO faces constraints due
to an imbalance between exploitation and exploration, rendering it susceptible
to local optima and demonstrating restricted effectiveness in addressing
complex optimization problems. To address these limitations, this study
presents an enhanced educational competition optimizer (IECO-MCO) utilizing
multi-covariance learning operators. In IECO, three distinct covariance
learning operators are introduced to improve the performance of ECO. Each
operator effectively balances exploitation and exploration while preventing
premature convergence of the population. The effectiveness of IECO is assessed
through benchmark functions derived from the CEC 2017 and CEC 2022 test suites,
and its performance is compared with various basic and improved algorithms
across different categories. The results demonstrate that IECO-MCO surpasses
the basic ECO and other competing algorithms in convergence speed, stability,
and the capability to avoid local optima. Furthermore, statistical analyses,
including the Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test,
are conducted to validate the superiority of IECO-MCO over the compared
algorithms. Compared with the basic algorithm (improved algorithm), IECO-MCO
achieved an average ranking of 2.213 (2.488) on the CE2017 and CEC2022 test
suites. Additionally, the practical applicability of the proposed IECO-MCO
algorithm is verified by solving constrained optimization problems. The
experimental outcomes demonstrate the superior performance of IECO-MCO in
tackling intricate optimization problems, underscoring its robustness and
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

*Teresa Portone,Bert Debusschere,Samantha Yang,Emiliano Islas-Quinones,T. Patrick Xiao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持流式处理和任意分区的给定数据Sobol' 指数估计方法，解决大规模型（如神经网络）敏感性分析中的内存和统计偏差问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的给定数据Sobol' 指数方法在处理输入参数极多（>10^4）的大型模型时存在内存占用过大和对非标准分布敏感性不足的问题

Method: 提出三个扩展：1）支持任意分区的普通Sobol' 指数估计器；2）批量流式处理算法；3）过滤小值指数的启发式策略

Result: 流式算法在保持精度和运行时间的同时降低内存需求，并解决了现有方法中均等概率分区导致的统计偏差问题

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了给定数据Sobol' 指数方法的应用范围，使得在神经网络等大型模型上进行方差基敏感性分析变得可行

Abstract: Given-data methods for variance-based sensitivity analysis have significantly
advanced the feasibility of Sobol' index computation for computationally
expensive models and models with many inputs. However, the limitations of
existing methods still preclude their application to models with an extremely
large number of inputs. In this work, we present practical extensions to the
existing given-data Sobol' index method, which allow variance-based sensitivity
analysis to be efficiently performed on large models such as neural networks,
which have $>10^4$ parameterizable inputs. For models of this size, holding all
input-output evaluations simultaneously in memory -- as required by existing
methods -- can quickly become impractical. These extensions also support
nonstandard input distributions with many repeated values, which are not
amenable to equiprobable partitions employed by existing given-data methods.
  Our extensions include a general definition of the given-data Sobol' index
estimator with arbitrary partition, a streaming algorithm to process
input-output samples in batches, and a heuristic to filter out small indices
that are indistinguishable from zero indices due to statistical noise. We show
that the equiprobable partition employed in existing given-data methods can
introduce significant bias into Sobol' index estimates even at large sample
sizes and provide numerical analyses that demonstrate why this can occur. We
also show that our streaming algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy and
runtimes with lower memory requirements, relative to current methods which
process all samples at once. We demonstrate our novel developments on two
application problems in neural network modeling.

Abstract: Many optimization problems in robotics involve the optimization of
time-expensive black-box functions, such as those involving complex simulations
or evaluation of real-world experiments. Furthermore, these functions are often
stochastic as repeated experiments are subject to unmeasurable disturbances.
Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize such methods in an efficient
manner by deploying a probabilistic function estimator to estimate with a given
confidence so that regions of the search space can be pruned away.
Consequently, the success of the Bayesian optimization depends on the function
estimator's ability to provide informative confidence bounds. Existing function
estimators require many function evaluations to infer the underlying confidence
or depend on modeling of the disturbances. In this paper, it is shown that the
confidence bounds provided by the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator
(WS-KDE) are applicable as excellent bounds to any stochastic function with an
output confined to the closed interval [0;1] regardless of the distribution of
the output. This finding opens up the use of WS-KDE for stable global
optimization on a wider range of cost functions. The properties of WS-KDE in
the context of Bayesian optimization are demonstrated in simulation and applied
to the problem of automated trap design for vibrational part feeders.

Conclusion: 这种新的证据方法不仅提供了更直接的证明途径，还为设计最优的多项式时间算法提供了见解。

Abstract: Low-degree polynomials have emerged as a powerful paradigm for providing
evidence of statistical-computational gaps across a variety of high-dimensional
statistical models [Wein25]. For detection problems -- where the goal is to
test a planted distribution $\mathbb{P}'$ against a null distribution
$\mathbb{P}$ with independent components -- the standard approach is to bound
the advantage using an $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthonormal family of
polynomials. However, this method breaks down for estimation tasks or more
complex testing problems where $\mathbb{P}$ has some planted structures, so
that no simple $\mathbb{L}^2(\mathbb{P})$-orthogonal polynomial family is
available. To address this challenge, several technical workarounds have been
proposed [SW22,SW25], though their implementation can be delicate. In this
work, we propose a more direct proof strategy. Focusing on random graph models,
we construct a basis of polynomials that is almost orthonormal under
$\mathbb{P}$, in precisely those regimes where statistical-computational gaps
arise. This almost orthonormal basis not only yields a direct route to
establishing low-degree lower bounds, but also allows us to explicitly identify
the polynomials that optimize the low-degree criterion. This, in turn, provides
insights into the design of optimal polynomial-time algorithms. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by recovering known low-degree lower bounds,
and establishing new ones for problems such as hidden subcliques, stochastic
block models, and seriation models.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative machine learning, powered by massive
computational resources, have demonstrated unprecedented human-like
capabilities. While beyond-classical quantum experiments can generate samples
from classically intractable distributions, their complexity has thwarted all
efforts toward efficient learning. This challenge has hindered demonstrations
of generative quantum advantage: the ability of quantum computers to learn and
generate desired outputs substantially better than classical computers. We
resolve this challenge by introducing families of generative quantum models
that are hard to simulate classically, are efficiently trainable, exhibit no
barren plateaus or proliferating local minima, and can learn to generate
distributions beyond the reach of classical computers. Using a $68$-qubit
superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate these capabilities in two
scenarios: learning classically intractable probability distributions and
learning quantum circuits for accelerated physical simulation. Our results
establish that both learning and sampling can be performed efficiently in the
beyond-classical regime, opening new possibilities for quantum-enhanced
generative models with provable advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TEE方案推理延迟高，分区方法在LLM非线性层产生大量通信开销；DP方法添加随机噪声会损害LLM性能和语义理解。需要克服这些缺陷。

Method: 在客户端TEE中机密部署嵌入层，后续层部署在GPU服务器上；优化Report-Noisy-Max机制保护敏感输入。

Result: 在Llama系列模型上的实验表明，CMIF减少了TEE中的额外推理开销，同时保护了用户数据隐私。

Conclusion: CMIF框架有效解决了TEE高延迟和DP性能下降的问题，实现了隐私保护与推理效率的平衡。

Abstract: CPU-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) and differential privacy (DP)
have gained wide applications for private inference. Due to high inference
latency in TEEs, researchers use partition-based approaches that offload linear
model components to GPUs. However, dense nonlinear layers of large language
models (LLMs) result in significant communication overhead between TEEs and
GPUs. DP-based approaches apply random noise to protect data privacy, but this
compromises LLM performance and semantic understanding. To overcome the above
drawbacks, this paper proposes CMIF, a Confidential and efficient Model
Inference Framework. CMIF confidentially deploys the embedding layer in the
client-side TEE and subsequent layers on GPU servers. Meanwhile, it optimizes
the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism to protect sensitive inputs with a slight
decrease in model performance. Extensive experiments on Llama-series models
demonstrate that CMIF reduces additional inference overhead in TEEs while
preserving user data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着设备端大语言模型系统的普及，联邦微调需要在处理敏感用户数据时解决隐私问题，现有的联邦学习框架存在隐私泄露风险。

Method: 每个客户端使用高斯噪声对LoRA矩阵进行本地裁剪和扰动，满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私要求，并提供理论分析证明更新的无偏性和噪声引入的方差界限。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，DP-FedLoRA在提供强隐私保证的同时保持了竞争性的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为设备端环境中可扩展且隐私保护的LLM部署铺平了道路，实现了隐私与性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: As on-device large language model (LLM) systems become increasingly
prevalent, federated fine-tuning enables advanced language understanding and
generation directly on edge devices; however, it also involves processing
sensitive, user-specific data, raising significant privacy concerns within the
federated learning framework. To address these challenges, we propose
DP-FedLoRA, a privacy-enhanced federated fine-tuning framework that integrates
LoRA-based adaptation with differential privacy in a communication-efficient
setting. Each client locally clips and perturbs its LoRA matrices using
Gaussian noise to satisfy ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy. We
further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the unbiased nature of the
updates and deriving bounds on the variance introduced by noise, offering
practical guidance for privacy-budget calibration. Experimental results across
mainstream benchmarks show that DP-FedLoRA delivers competitive performance
while offering strong privacy guarantees, paving the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving LLM deployment in on-device environments.

Conclusion: 现有LLM水印方案存在显著漏洞，任何固定防御都可被合适的扰动策略绕过，迫切需要开发新的鲁棒水印机制

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking embeds detectable signals into
generated text for copyright protection, misuse prevention, and content
detection. While prior studies evaluate robustness using watermark removal
attacks, these methods are often suboptimal, creating the misconception that
effective removal requires large perturbations or powerful adversaries.
  To bridge the gap, we first formalize the system model for LLM watermark, and
characterize two realistic threat models constrained on limited access to the
watermark detector. We then analyze how different types of perturbation vary in
their attack range, i.e., the number of tokens they can affect with a single
edit. We observe that character-level perturbations (e.g., typos, swaps,
deletions, homoglyphs) can influence multiple tokens simultaneously by
disrupting the tokenization process. We demonstrate that character-level
perturbations are significantly more effective for watermark removal under the
most restrictive threat model. We further propose guided removal attacks based
on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that uses a reference detector for optimization.
Under a practical threat model with limited black-box queries to the watermark
detector, our method demonstrates strong removal performance. Experiments
confirm the superiority of character-level perturbations and the effectiveness
of the GA in removing watermarks under realistic constraints. Additionally, we
argue there is an adversarial dilemma when considering potential defenses: any
fixed defense can be bypassed by a suitable perturbation strategy. Motivated by
this principle, we propose an adaptive compound character-level attack.
Experimental results show that this approach can effectively defeat the
defenses. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in existing LLM
watermark schemes and underline the urgency for the development of new robust
mechanisms.

Abstract: We present CryptGNN, a secure and effective inference solution for

client's input data and graph structure from the cloud provider and the
third-party model owner, and it protects the model parameters from the cloud
provider and the clients. CryptGNN works with any number of SMPC parties, does
not require a trusted server, and is provably secure even if P-1 out of P
parties in the cloud collude. Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments
demonstrate the security and efficiency of CryptGNN.

Conclusion: ENSI框架通过架构与密码协议的协同设计，有效解决了LLM安全推理的实用性瓶颈，为隐私保护机器学习提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Secure inference enables privacy-preserving machine learning by leveraging
cryptographic protocols that support computations on sensitive user data
without exposing it. However, integrating cryptographic protocols with large
language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges, as the inherent
complexity of these protocols, together with LLMs' massive parameter scale and
sophisticated architectures, severely limits practical usability. In this work,
we propose ENSI, a novel non-interactive secure inference framework for LLMs,
based on the principle of co-designing the cryptographic protocols and LLM
architecture. ENSI employs an optimized encoding strategy that seamlessly
integrates CKKS scheme with a lightweight LLM variant, BitNet, significantly
reducing the computational complexity of encrypted matrix multiplications. In
response to the prohibitive computational demands of softmax under homomorphic
encryption (HE), we pioneer the integration of the sigmoid attention mechanism
with HE as a seamless, retraining-free alternative. Furthermore, by embedding
the Bootstrapping operation within the RMSNorm process, we efficiently refresh
ciphertexts while markedly decreasing the frequency of costly bootstrapping
invocations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ENSI achieves
approximately an 8x acceleration in matrix multiplications and a 2.6x speedup
in softmax inference on CPU compared to state-of-the-art method, with the
proportion of bootstrapping is reduced to just 1%.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced text-to-image generation,
enabling the creation of highly realistic images conditioned on textual prompts
and seeds. Given the considerable intellectual and economic value embedded in
such prompts, prompt theft poses a critical security and privacy concern. In
this paper, we investigate prompt-stealing attacks targeting diffusion models.
We reveal that numerical optimization-based prompt recovery methods are
fundamentally limited as they do not account for the initial random noise used
during image generation. We identify and exploit a noise-generation
vulnerability (CWE-339), prevalent in major image-generation frameworks,
originating from PyTorch's restriction of seed values to a range of $2^{32}$
when generating the initial random noise on CPUs. Through a large-scale
empirical analysis conducted on images shared via the popular platform CivitAI,
we demonstrate that approximately 95% of these images' seed values can be
effectively brute-forced in 140 minutes per seed using our seed-recovery tool,
SeedSnitch. Leveraging the recovered seed, we propose PromptPirate, a genetic
algorithm-based optimization method explicitly designed for prompt stealing.
PromptPirate surpasses state-of-the-art methods, i.e., PromptStealer, P2HP, and
CLIP-Interrogator, achieving an 8-11% improvement in LPIPS similarity.
Furthermore, we introduce straightforward and effective countermeasures that
render seed stealing, and thus optimization-based prompt stealing, ineffective.
We have disclosed our findings responsibly and initiated coordinated mitigation
efforts with the developers to address this critical vulnerability.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning techniques rely on labeled data to achieve high
task performance, but this requires the labels to capture some meaningful
differences in the underlying data structure. For training network intrusion
detection algorithms, most datasets contain a series of attack classes and a
single large benign class which captures all non-attack network traffic. A
review of intrusion detection papers and guides that explicitly state their
data preprocessing steps identified that the majority took the labeled
categories of the dataset at face value when training their algorithms. The
present paper evaluates the structure of benign traffic in several common
intrusion detection datasets (NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS 2017) and
determines whether there are meaningful sub-categories within this traffic
which may improve overall multi-classification performance using common machine
learning techniques. We present an overview of some unsupervised clustering
techniques (e.g., HDBSCAN, Mean Shift Clustering) and show how they
differentially cluster the benign traffic space.

Conclusion: READ提供了一个基于学习表示的强大鲁棒估计框架，能够选择同等鲁棒的估计器同时最优构建表示结构

Abstract: We propose REpresentation-Aware Distributionally Robust Estimation (READ), a
novel framework for Wasserstein distributionally robust learning that accounts
for predictive representations when guarding against distributional shifts.
Unlike classical approaches that treat all feature perturbations equally, READ
embeds a multidimensional alignment parameter into the transport cost, allowing
the model to differentially discourage perturbations along directions
associated with informative representations. This yields robustness to feature
variation while preserving invariant structure. Our first contribution is a
theoretical foundation: we show that seminorm regularizations for linear
regression and binary classification arise as Wasserstein distributionally
robust objectives, thereby providing tractable reformulations of READ and
unifying a broad class of regularized estimators under the DRO lens. Second, we
adopt a principled procedure for selecting the Wasserstein radius using the
techniques of robust Wasserstein profile inference. This further enables the
construction of valid, representation-aware confidence regions for model
parameters with distinct geometric features. Finally, we analyze the geometry
of READ estimators as the alignment parameters vary and propose an optimization
algorithm to estimate the projection of the global optimum onto this solution
surface. This procedure selects among equally robust estimators while optimally
constructing a representation structure. We conclude by demonstrating the
effectiveness of our framework through extensive simulations and a real-world
study, providing a powerful robust estimation grounded in learning
representation.

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于流场的运动规划方法，使用Koopman算子理论来学习期望轨迹的动态系统表示，能够从任意初始状态驱动机器人收敛到参考轨迹的终点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在动态系统建模中表现有效，但它本身不能保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，这在从演示学习(LfD)中是必需的要求。

Method: 将运动流场表示为动态系统，用Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，并利用学习到的流场的发散特性获得平滑的运动场，使机器人在偏离期望轨迹时能够收敛到参考轨迹并跟踪到终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上进行了评估，包括频谱分析。在物理机器人上的实验验证了在非静态流体环境中的有效性。方法具有高度样本效率，仅需3%的LASA数据集就能生成密集运动规划，在空间和时间动态建模指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KoopMotion提供了一种有效的运动规划方法，能够从任意初始状态收敛到期望轨迹，具有高样本效率和优异的动态建模性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型面临的两个核心挑战：大规模人类操作轨迹数据的稀缺性和高成本，以及在分布偏移任务中的有限泛化能力。受大型推理模型通过强化学习提升推理能力的启发，探索RL是否能类似地改进VLA模型的长期动作规划。

Conclusion: SimpleVLA-RL框架成功证明了强化学习可以有效提升VLA模型的长期动作规划能力，发现了训练过程中的"pushcut"现象，表明策略能够发现之前未见过的模式，为VLA模型的进一步发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象的相对控制方法"ObjectReact"，通过构建相对3D场景图来实现更好的视觉导航性能，充分利用对象表征的体验和路径不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图像相对性的视觉导航方法存在限制，图像与代理的位始和体验绑定，而对象作为地图属性提供了更好的世界表征方式。

Method: 提出一种基于"相对"3D场景图的顶度地图表征，用于获取更有信息的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个本地控制器ObjectReact，直接条件化高级"WayObject Costmap"表征，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Conclusion: 这个工作提供了一种新的导航范式，通过学习对象相对控制来充分利用对象表征的优势，实现了更高的交叉体验部署不变性和更好的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

Conclusion: Dexplore提供了一个原则性桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨物体泛化和真实世界部署

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.
