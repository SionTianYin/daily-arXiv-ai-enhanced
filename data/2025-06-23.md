### [2] [Rethinking LLM Training through Information Geometry and Quantum Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15830)
*Riccardo Di Sipio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大语言模型（LLM）优化中，信息几何如何通过Fisher信息度量提供更原则性的学习方法，并讨论了曲率感知方法对理解LLM训练的意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在高维参数空间中的优化问题，利用信息几何框架（如Fisher信息度量）提供更原则性的学习方法。

Method: 采用信息几何框架，特别是Fisher信息度量和自然梯度下降，分析LLM优化问题。

Result: 曲率感知方法有助于深入理解LLM训练中的现象（如尖锐极小值、泛化和缩放规律）。

Conclusion: 信息几何为LLM优化提供了新的视角，并可能通过量子类比（如Fubini-Study度量和量子Fisher信息）在量子增强系统中实现高效优化。

Abstract: Optimization in large language models (LLMs) unfolds over high-dimensional
parameter spaces with non-Euclidean structure. Information geometry frames this
landscape using the Fisher information metric, enabling more principled
learning via natural gradient descent. Though often impractical, this geometric
lens clarifies phenomena such as sharp minima, generalization, and observed
scaling laws. We argue that curvature-aware approaches deepen our understanding
of LLM training. Finally, we speculate on quantum analogies based on the
Fubini-Study metric and Quantum Fisher Information, hinting at efficient
optimization in quantum-enhanced systems.

### [3] [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15841)
*Zijian Zhou,Ao Qu,Zhaoxuan Wu,Sunghwan Kim,Alok Prakash,Daniela Rus,Jinhua Zhao,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEM1是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过动态更新共享内部状态，实现长多轮任务中的恒定内存使用，显著提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统依赖全上下文提示，导致内存增长、计算成本增加和性能下降，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: MEM1采用强化学习框架，动态更新紧凑共享内部状态，整合新观察并丢弃冗余信息，同时提出多轮环境构建方法。

Result: MEM1-7B在多项任务中性能提升3.5倍，内存使用减少3.7倍，并能泛化到训练范围之外。

Conclusion: MEM1展示了推理驱动内存整合的潜力，为长周期交互代理提供高效且性能优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn
interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations,
and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context
prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads
to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded
reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,
an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate
with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a
compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and
reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the
environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.
To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a
simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn
environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task
sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,
open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves
performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes
beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of
reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing
solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency
and performance are optimized.

### [4] [Finance Language Model Evaluation (FLaME)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15846)
*Glenn Matlin,Mika Okamoto,Huzaifa Pardawala,Yang Yang,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了FLaME框架，首次全面评估语言模型在金融NLP任务中的表现，填补了现有评估方法的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在缺陷，导致对语言模型在金融NLP任务中性能的低估。

Method: 开发了FLaME框架，对23种基础语言模型在20项金融NLP任务中进行了实证研究。

Result: 展示了语言模型在金融NLP任务中的潜力，并开源了框架和数据。

Conclusion: FLaME框架为金融NLP任务提供了更准确的评估工具，证明了语言模型的实际能力。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly
specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess
due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which
have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on
common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for
these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for
Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to
comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical
study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source
our framework software along with all data and results.

### [5] [Entropy-Driven Pre-Tokenization for Byte-Pair Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15889)
*Yifan Hu,Frank Liang,Dachuan Zhao,Jonathan Geuter,Varshini Reddy,Craig W. Schmidt,Chris Tanner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于熵的预分词策略，改进BPE在中文等未分词语言中的应用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPE在未分词语言（如中文）中因忽略语言边界而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出两种熵引导的预分词策略：1）利用点互信息和左右熵识别连贯字符；2）利用GPT-2预测熵检测边界不确定性。

Result: 在PKU数据集上，两种方法显著提升了分词精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 熵引导的预分词策略能更好对齐语言学单元，为低资源或多语言场景提供改进方向。

Abstract: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) has become a widely adopted subword tokenization
method in modern language models due to its simplicity and strong empirical
performance across downstream tasks. However, applying BPE to unsegmented
languages such as Chinese presents significant challenges, as its
frequency-driven merge operation is agnostic to linguistic boundaries. To
address this, we propose two entropy-informed pre-tokenization strategies that
guide BPE segmentation using unsupervised information-theoretic cues. The first
approach uses pointwise mutual information and left/right entropy to identify
coherent character spans, while the second leverages predictive entropy derived
from a pretrained GPT-2 model to detect boundary uncertainty. We evaluate both
methods on a subset of the PKU dataset and demonstrate substantial improvements
in segmentation precision, recall, and F1 score compared to standard BPE. Our
results suggest that entropy-guided pre-tokenization not only enhances
alignment with gold-standard linguistic units but also offers a promising
direction for improving tokenization quality in low-resource and multilingual
settings.

### [6] [Language Models can perform Single-Utterance Self-Correction of Perturbed Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15894)
*Sam Silver,Jimin Sun,Ivan Zhang,Sara Hooker,Eddie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）具有内在的自我纠正能力，即使未针对长链思维（CoT）进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学推理上表现优异，但其性能对问题描述和提示策略的微小变化敏感，且易受采样误差影响。

Method: 通过实验测量模型对合成扰动引入其CoT推理的自我纠正能力。

Result: 观察到模型在单次表达中展现出从隐式到显式的自我纠正行为。

Conclusion: LLMs的内在自我纠正能力可能比文献中展示的更强，表明近期“推理”模型研究放大了模型已有的特质。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive mathematical
reasoning capabilities, yet their performance remains brittle to minor
variations in problem description and prompting strategy. Furthermore,
reasoning is vulnerable to sampling-induced errors which autoregressive models
must primarily address using self-correction via additionally-generated tokens.
To better understand self-correction capabilities of recent models, we conduct
experiments measuring models' ability to self-correct synthetic perturbations
introduced into their Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. We observe robust
single-utterance intrinsic self-correction behavior across a range of
open-weight models and datasets, ranging from subtle, implicit corrections to
explicit acknowledgments and corrections of errors. Our findings suggest that
LLMs, including those not finetuned for long CoT, may possess stronger
intrinsic self-correction capabilities than commonly shown in the literature.
The presence of this ability suggests that recent "reasoning" model work
involves amplification of traits already meaningfully present in models.

### [7] [From RAG to Agentic: Validating Islamic-Medicine Responses with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15911)
*Mohammad Amaan Sayeed,Mohammed Talha Alam,Raza Imam,Shahab Saquib Sohail,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Tibbe-AG评估框架，结合伊斯兰医学文本与检索增强生成技术，提升AI在文化敏感医疗问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊斯兰医学文本如《医学经典》和《先知医学》蕴含丰富预防与营养知识，但现代AI系统未充分利用。现有语言模型评测缺乏文化背景验证。

Method: 提出Tibbe-AG评估流程，结合30个精选先知医学问题、人类验证疗法，测试三种LLM（直接生成、检索增强生成、科学自评过滤）。

Result: 检索提升事实准确性13%，自评提示进一步优化10%，结合传统文本与AI技术实现可靠文化敏感医疗问答。

Conclusion: 融合古典伊斯兰医学、检索与自评技术，可提升AI在文化敏感医疗领域的表现。

Abstract: Centuries-old Islamic medical texts like Avicenna's Canon of Medicine and the
Prophetic Tibb-e-Nabawi encode a wealth of preventive care, nutrition, and
holistic therapies, yet remain inaccessible to many and underutilized in modern
AI systems. Existing language-model benchmarks focus narrowly on factual recall
or user preference, leaving a gap in validating culturally grounded medical
guidance at scale. We propose a unified evaluation pipeline, Tibbe-AG, that
aligns 30 carefully curated Prophetic-medicine questions with human-verified
remedies and compares three LLMs (LLaMA-3, Mistral-7B, Qwen2-7B) under three
configurations: direct generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and a
scientific self-critique filter. Each answer is then assessed by a secondary
LLM serving as an agentic judge, yielding a single 3C3H quality score.
Retrieval improves factual accuracy by 13%, while the agentic prompt adds
another 10% improvement through deeper mechanistic insight and safety
considerations. Our results demonstrate that blending classical Islamic texts
with retrieval and self-evaluation enables reliable, culturally sensitive
medical question-answering.

### [8] [Reranking-based Generation for Unbiased Perspective Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15925)
*Narutatsu Ri,Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进政治观点摘要的方法，通过识别可靠指标和探索LLM方法的有效性，发现基于语言模型的指标优于传统指标，且重排序和偏好调优能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架依赖传统指标，未验证其适用性，且改进摘要生成方法的研究尚不成熟。

Method: 构建测试集验证指标可靠性，比较传统指标与语言模型指标，并研究重排序和偏好调优方法。

Result: 语言模型指标优于传统指标，重排序和偏好调优显著提升摘要性能。

Conclusion: 研究为政治观点摘要的可靠评估和方法开发提供了贡献。

Abstract: Generating unbiased summaries in real-world settings such as political
perspective summarization remains a crucial application of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Yet, existing evaluation frameworks rely on traditional metrics
for measuring key attributes such as coverage and faithfulness without
verifying their applicability, and efforts to develop improved summarizers are
still nascent. We address these gaps by (1) identifying reliable metrics for
measuring perspective summary quality, and (2) investigating the efficacy of
LLM-based methods beyond zero-shot inference. Namely, we build a test set for
benchmarking metric reliability using human annotations and show that
traditional metrics underperform compared to language model-based metrics,
which prove to be strong evaluators. Using these metrics, we show that
reranking-based methods yield strong results, and preference tuning with
synthetically generated and reranking-labeled data further boosts performance.
Our findings aim to contribute to the reliable evaluation and development of
perspective summarization methods.

### [9] [A Vietnamese Dataset for Text Segmentation and Multiple Choices Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15978)
*Toan Nguyen Hai,Ha Nguyen Viet,Truong Quan Xuan,Duc Do Minh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VSMRC是一个越南语文本分割和阅读理解数据集，填补了越南语NLP资源的空白，实验表明多语言模型（如mBERT）在任务中表现优于单语模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南语作为全球第20大语言，缺乏高质量的NLP资源，特别是在文本分割和阅读理解任务上。

Method: 数据集来自越南语维基百科，包含15,942份文本分割文档和16,347个人工质量保证的合成多选题对。

Result: mBERT在阅读理解测试集上准确率达88.01%，文本分割测试集F1得分为63.15%。

Conclusion: 多语言模型在越南语NLP任务中表现优异，可能适用于其他资源匮乏的语言。

Abstract: Vietnamese, the 20th most spoken language with over 102 million native
speakers, lacks robust resources for key natural language processing tasks such
as text segmentation and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address this
gap, we present VSMRC, the Vietnamese Text Segmentation and Multiple-Choice
Reading Comprehension Dataset. Sourced from Vietnamese Wikipedia, our dataset
includes 15,942 documents for text segmentation and 16,347 synthetic
multiple-choice question-answer pairs generated with human quality assurance,
ensuring a reliable and diverse resource. Experiments show that mBERT
consistently outperforms monolingual models on both tasks, achieving an
accuracy of 88.01% on MRC test set and an F1 score of 63.15\% on text
segmentation test set. Our analysis reveals that multilingual models excel in
NLP tasks for Vietnamese, suggesting potential applications to other
under-resourced languages. VSMRC is available at HuggingFace

### [10] [Double Entendre: Robust Audio-Based AI-Generated Lyrics Detection via Multi-View Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15981)
*Markus Frohmann,Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal,Markus Schedl,Elena V. Epure*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态、模块化的晚期融合方法DE-detect，结合音频中的歌词转录和语音特征，以更鲁棒地检测AI生成的音乐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI音乐生成工具的快速发展对艺术家、版权持有者和平台提出了挑战，现有检测方法（基于音频或歌词）存在局限性。

Method: 采用多模态、模块化的晚期融合管道，结合自动转录的歌词和音频中的语音特征。

Result: DE-detect在实验中优于现有基于歌词的检测器，并对音频扰动更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际场景中检测AI生成音乐提供了有效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing
the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders,
and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such
AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or
lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to
generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio
perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate
lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion
pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech
features capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on
lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates
susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.
Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based
detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations. Thus, it offers
an effective, robust solution for detecting AI-generated music in real-world
scenarios. Our code is available at
https://github.com/deezer/robust-AI-lyrics-detection.

### [11] [From General to Targeted Rewards: Surpassing GPT-4 in Open-Ended Long-Context Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16024)
*Zhihan Guo,Jiele Wu,Wenqian Cui,Yifei Zhang,Minda Hu,Yufei Wang,Irwin King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出ProxyReward框架，通过强化学习解决开放长文本生成任务中缺乏高质量参考数据的问题，性能超越GPT-4-Turbo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放长文本生成任务缺乏高质量参考数据，现有方法仅依赖通用评估信号，限制了准确性。

Method: ProxyReward框架包括自动生成数据集和针对性奖励信号计算，无需大量标注数据。

Result: 实验显示ProxyReward性能提升20%，超越GPT-4-Turbo和LLM-as-a-Judge方法。

Conclusion: ProxyReward有效提升LLM处理复杂开放问题的能力。

Abstract: Current research on long-form context in Large Language Models (LLMs)
primarily focuses on the understanding of long-contexts, the Open-ended Long
Text Generation (Open-LTG) remains insufficiently explored. Training a
long-context generation model requires curation of gold standard reference
data, which is typically nonexistent for informative Open-LTG tasks. However,
previous methods only utilize general assessments as reward signals, which
limits accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProxyReward, an innovative
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework, which includes a dataset and a
reward signal computation method. Firstly, ProxyReward Dataset generation is
accomplished through simple prompts that enables the model to create
automatically, obviating extensive labeled data or significant manual effort.
Secondly, ProxyReward Signal offers a targeted evaluation of information
comprehensiveness and accuracy for specific questions. The experimental results
indicate that our method ProxyReward surpasses even GPT-4-Turbo. It can
significantly enhance performance by 20% on the Open-LTG task when training
widely used open-source models, while also surpassing the LLM-as-a-Judge
approach. Our work presents effective methods to enhance the ability of LLMs to
address complex open-ended questions posed by human.

### [12] [EvoLM: In Search of Lost Language Model Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16029)
*Zhenting Qi,Fan Nie,Alexandre Alahi,James Zou,Himabindu Lakkaraju,Yilun Du,Eric Xing,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoLM是一个模型套件，用于系统分析语言模型在不同训练阶段的动态，包括预训练、持续预训练、监督微调和强化学习。通过训练100多个模型，揭示了过度训练的收益递减、持续预训练的重要性以及微调和强化学习的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型训练分为多个阶段，下游开发者难以评估每个阶段设计选择的影响，因此需要透明和系统的分析方法。

Method: 训练超过100个1B和4B参数的模型，评估语言建模和问题解决能力，包括域内和域外泛化。

Result: 发现过度预训练和后期训练的收益递减，持续预训练对缓解遗忘和连接训练阶段至关重要，微调和强化学习存在复杂权衡。

Conclusion: EvoLM为语言模型训练提供了透明分析工具，并开源了所有模型、数据集和评估流程，促进开放研究和可重复性。

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages,
making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design
choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables
systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across
pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement
learning. By training over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, we
rigorously evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream
(problem-solving) reasoning capabilities, including considerations of both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the
diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the
importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific
continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging
pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when
configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate
open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained
models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and
evaluation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂问答任务中多跳推理和长文档上下文理解的难题。

Method: 结合密集检索模块、高级上下文融合和多跳推理机制，采用联合优化策略（检索似然和生成交叉熵）。

Result: 实验表明，该系统优于现有检索增强和生成基线，能提供更精确、上下文相关的答案。

Conclusion: 该框架在复杂问答任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性和适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework
tailored for complex question answering tasks, addressing challenges in
multi-hop reasoning and contextual understanding across lengthy documents.
Built upon LLaMA 3, the framework integrates a dense retrieval module with
advanced context fusion and multi-hop reasoning mechanisms, enabling more
accurate and coherent response generation. A joint optimization strategy
combining retrieval likelihood and generation cross-entropy improves the
model's robustness and adaptability. Experimental results show that the
proposed system outperforms existing retrieval-augmented and generative
baselines, confirming its effectiveness in delivering precise, contextually
grounded answers.

*Fei Wang,Xingchen Wan,Ruoxi Sun,Jiefeng Chen,Sercan Ö. Arık*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynScaling通过并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架，提升大语言模型性能，无需外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理时扩展虽能提升大语言模型性能，但依赖外部验证器或未优化实际计算限制。

Method: 提出DynScaling，结合并行-顺序采样策略和动态预算分配框架。

Result: 实验显示DynScaling在任务性能和计算成本上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DynScaling有效解决了实际资源限制下的性能提升问题。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has proven effective in boosting large language model
(LLM) performance through increased test-time computation. Yet, its practical
application is often hindered by reliance on external verifiers or a lack of
optimization for realistic computational constraints. We propose DynScaling,
which addresses these limitations through two primary innovations: an
integrated parallel-sequential sampling strategy and a bandit-based dynamic
budget allocation framework. The integrated sampling strategy unifies parallel
and sequential sampling by constructing synthetic sequential reasoning chains
from initially independent parallel responses, promoting diverse and coherent
reasoning trajectories. The dynamic budget allocation framework formulates the
allocation of computational resources as a multi-armed bandit problem,
adaptively distributing the inference budget across queries based on the
uncertainty of previously sampled responses, thereby maximizing computational
efficiency. By combining these components, DynScaling effectively improves LLM
performance under practical resource constraints without the need for external
verifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that DynScaling consistently
surpasses existing verifier-free inference scaling baselines in both task
performance and computational cost.

Abstract: The proliferation of online communication platforms has created unprecedented
opportunities for global connectivity while simultaneously enabling harmful
behaviors such as cyberbullying, which affects approximately 54.4\% of
teenagers according to recent research. This paper presents a hybrid
architecture that combines the contextual understanding capabilities of
transformer-based models with the pattern recognition strengths of broad
learning systems for effective cyberbullying detection. This approach
integrates a modified DeBERTa model augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation
blocks and sentiment analysis capabilities with a Gated Broad Learning System
(GBLS) classifier, creating a synergistic framework that outperforms existing
approaches across multiple benchmark datasets. The proposed ModifiedDeBERTa +
GBLS model achieved good performance on four English datasets: 79.3\% accuracy
on HateXplain, 95.41\% accuracy on SOSNet, 91.37\% accuracy on Mendeley-I, and
94.67\% accuracy on Mendeley-II. Beyond performance gains, the framework
incorporates comprehensive explainability mechanisms including token-level
attribution analysis, LIME-based local interpretations, and confidence
calibration, addressing critical transparency requirements in automated content
moderation. Ablation studies confirm the meaningful contribution of each
architectural component, while failure case analysis reveals specific
challenges in detecting implicit bias and sarcastic content, providing valuable
insights for future improvements in cyberbullying detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是明确更深层的Transformer模型在表达能力上的具体提升，并通过理论证明和实验验证这一假设。

Method: 方法包括理论证明（将Transformer与C-RASP编程语言等价性关联）和实证研究（验证无位置编码的Transformer在序列依赖任务中的表现）。

Result: 结果表明，更深的Transformer模型在表达能力上更强，且理论预测与实际任务表现一致。

Conclusion: 结论是更深层的Transformer模型确实具有更强的表达能力，且理论框架能够有效预测其在实际任务中的表现。

Abstract: It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more
layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which
capabilities are gained with greater depth? We answer this question with a
theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider
transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show
that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the
programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we
prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP
programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower
transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). These results are
established by studying a form of temporal logic with counting operators, which
was shown equivalent to C-RASP in previous work. Finally, we provide empirical
evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without
positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency
tasks.

*Duc Hieu Ho,Chenglin Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自我批判引导的好奇心精炼提示策略，通过轻量级的上下文步骤改进大语言模型的输出质量，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但其输出的诚实性和帮助性仍是一个挑战。

Method: 通过基准评估十种大语言模型，并提出自我批判引导的好奇心精炼提示策略，包括自我批判和精炼步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在所有模型中均提升了输出质量，H²分数相对提升1.4%至4.3%。

Conclusion: 结构化自我精炼是一种可扩展且无需训练的策略，能有效提升大语言模型输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated robust capabilities across
various natural language tasks. However, producing outputs that are
consistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this
challenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.
It conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large
language models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,
Meta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,
self-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this
strategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without
additional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting
strategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including
self-critique step and refinement step.
  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework
$\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a
judge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all
models. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases
high-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\mathrm{H}^2$ scores
ranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across
evaluated models. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured
self-refinement as a scalable and training-free strategy to improve the
trustworthiness of LLMs outputs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于MURIL架构的Hinglish文本网络欺凌检测框架，显著优于现有多语言模型，并提供了可解释性特征和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字通信平台的增长导致全球网络欺凌事件增加，现有系统难以处理Hinglish（印地语-英语混合）文本，亟需改进。

Method: 使用MURIL架构，结合选择性层冻结、分类头设计和针对混合内容的预处理，提升检测性能。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，MURIL模型表现优于RoBERTa和IndicBERT，准确率提升1.36至13.07个百分点。

Conclusion: 框架通过可解释性分析和失败案例研究，为多语言网络欺凌检测的未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: The growth of digital communication platforms has led to increased
cyberbullying incidents worldwide, creating a need for automated detection
systems to protect users. The rise of code-mixed Hindi-English (Hinglish)
communication on digital platforms poses challenges for existing cyberbullying
detection systems, which were designed primarily for monolingual text. This
paper presents a framework for cyberbullying detection in Hinglish text using
the Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MURIL) architecture to
address limitations in current approaches. Evaluation across six benchmark
datasets -- Bohra \textit{et al.}, BullyExplain, BullySentemo, Kumar \textit{et
al.}, HASOC 2021, and Mendeley Indo-HateSpeech -- shows that the MURIL-based
approach outperforms existing multilingual models including RoBERTa and
IndicBERT, with improvements of 1.36 to 13.07 percentage points and accuracies
of 86.97\% on Bohra, 84.62\% on BullyExplain, 86.03\% on BullySentemo, 75.41\%
on Kumar datasets, 83.92\% on HASOC 2021, and 94.63\% on Mendeley dataset. The
framework includes explainability features through attribution analysis and
cross-linguistic pattern recognition. Ablation studies show that selective
layer freezing, appropriate classification head design, and specialized
preprocessing for code-mixed content improve detection performance, while
failure analysis identifies challenges including context-dependent
interpretation, cultural understanding, and cross-linguistic sarcasm detection,
providing directions for future research in multilingual cyberbullying
detection.

TL;DR: FinCoT是一种结合领域专家知识的结构化思维链提示方法，显著提升金融NLP任务性能并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融NLP中结构化思维链提示的研究不足，且现有方法多依赖非领域专家的启发式设计。

Method: 提出FinCoT方法，对比标准提示、非结构化思维链提示和结构化思维链提示，并在CFA金融问题上评估。

Result: FinCoT将性能从63.2%提升至80.5%，并减少生成标记量八倍。

Conclusion: 领域对齐的结构化提示能提升性能、降低成本，并生成更可解释的专家对齐推理轨迹。

Abstract: This paper presents FinCoT, a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
approach that incorporates insights from domain-specific expert financial
reasoning to guide the reasoning traces of large language models. We
investigate that there are three main prompting styles in FinNLP: (1) standard
prompting--zero-shot prompting; (2) unstructured CoT--CoT prompting without an
explicit reasoning structure, such as the use of tags; and (3) structured CoT
prompting--CoT prompting with explicit instructions or examples that define
structured reasoning steps. Previously, FinNLP has primarily focused on prompt
engineering with either standard or unstructured CoT prompting. However,
structured CoT prompting has received limited attention in prior work.
Furthermore, the design of reasoning structures in structured CoT prompting is
often based on heuristics from non-domain experts. In this study, we
investigate each prompting approach in FinNLP. We evaluate the three main
prompting styles and FinCoT on CFA-style questions spanning ten financial
domains. We observe that FinCoT improves performance from 63.2% to 80.5% and
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct from 69.7% to 74.2%, while reducing generated tokens
eight-fold compared to structured CoT prompting. Our findings show that
domain-aligned structured prompts not only improve performance and reduce
inference costs but also yield more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning
traces.

Motivation: 探讨语言结构是否影响LLM的认知和推理模式，验证语言相对性假说在LLM中的表现。

Method: 引入BICAUSE双语数据集，分析LLM在中文和英文因果推理任务中的注意力模式和表现。

Result: LLM表现出与语言类型对齐的注意力模式，内化了语言特有的因果词序偏好，并在成功推理时实现跨语言的语义对齐。

Conclusion: LLM不仅模仿语言表面形式，还内化了语言塑造的推理偏见，首次通过模型内部结构分析验证了这一现象。

Abstract: Language is not only a tool for communication but also a medium for human
cognition and reasoning. If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure
of language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)
trained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures
embedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce
BICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes
semantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed
causal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit
typologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and
sentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced
distribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences
for causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading
to degraded performance, especially in Chinese. (3) When causal reasoning
succeeds, model representations converge toward semantically aligned
abstractions across languages, indicating a shared understanding beyond surface
form. Overall, these results suggest that LLMs not only mimic surface
linguistic forms but also internalize the reasoning biases shaped by language.
Rooted in cognitive linguistic theory, this phenomenon is for the first time
empirically verified through structural analysis of model internals.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法常忽视LLM的校准能力，而LLM的上下文推理能力未被充分利用。本文旨在通过特定提示提升LLM的校准效果。

Method: 提出SGIC框架，利用不确定性评分评估文档相关性和LLM响应置信度，并通过迭代重新评分和结合历史响应优化校准。同时，构建自校准训练集以优化LLM。

Result: SGIC框架显著提升了闭源和开源LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 通过自引导迭代校准和不确定性评分，LLM的校准能力和响应准确性得到显著提升。

Abstract: Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has concentrated on
retrieving useful information from candidate documents. However, numerous
methodologies frequently neglect the calibration capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), which capitalize on their robust in-context reasoning prowess.
This work illustrates that providing LLMs with specific cues substantially
improves their calibration efficacy, especially in multi-round calibrations. We
present a new SGIC: Self-Guided Iterative Calibration Framework that employs
uncertainty scores as a tool. Initially, this framework calculates uncertainty
scores to determine both the relevance of each document to the query and the
confidence level in the responses produced by the LLMs. Subsequently, it
reevaluates these scores iteratively, amalgamating them with prior responses to
refine calibration. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for
constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs
to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information
and enhancing response accuracy. Our proposed framework significantly improves
performance on both closed-source and open-weight LLMs.

experiments on non-proprietary large language models (LLMs) and on GPT-4o
reveal that even GPT-4o achieves only an average score of about 0.7, while the
best-performing Japanese LLM attains around 0.5, indicating a relatively large

Abstract: The findings section of a radiology report is often detailed and lengthy,
whereas the impression section is comparatively more compact and captures key
diagnostic conclusions. This research explores the use of advanced abstractive
summarization models to generate the concise impression from the findings
section of a radiology report. We have used the publicly available MIMIC-CXR

open-source large language models, including T5-base, BART-base,
PEGASUS-x-base, ChatGPT-4, LLaMA-3-8B, and a custom Pointer Generator Network
with a coverage mechanism. To ensure a thorough assessment, multiple evaluation
metrics are employed, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and

Conclusion: 弱标注数据是低资源语言语音到文本翻译的有效替代方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality annotated data presents a significant challenge
in developing effective end-to-end speech-to-text translation (ST) systems,
particularly for low-resource languages. This paper explores the hypothesis
that weakly labeled data can be used to build ST models for low-resource
language pairs. We constructed speech-to-text translation datasets with the
help of bitext mining using state-of-the-art sentence encoders. We mined the
multilingual Shrutilipi corpus to build Shrutilipi-anuvaad, a dataset
comprising ST data for language pairs Bengali-Hindi, Malayalam-Hindi,
Odia-Hindi, and Telugu-Hindi. We created multiple versions of training data
with varying degrees of quality and quantity to investigate the effect of
quality versus quantity of weakly labeled data on ST model performance. Results
demonstrate that ST systems can be built using weakly labeled data, with
performance comparable to massive multi-modal multilingual baselines such as
SONAR and SeamlessM4T.

Result: 实验表明，这些改进显著提升了内容相关性、语言使用和整体评估性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用更丰富、更细致的特征集可以全面改善口语评估效果。

Abstract: Current automated speaking assessment (ASA) systems for use in multi-aspect
evaluations often fail to make full use of content relevance, overlooking image
or exemplar cues, and employ superficial grammar analysis that lacks detailed
error types. This paper ameliorates these deficiencies by introducing two novel
enhancements to construct a hybrid scoring model. First, a multifaceted
relevance module integrates question and the associated image content,
exemplar, and spoken response of an L2 speaker for a comprehensive assessment
of content relevance. Second, fine-grained grammar error features are derived
using advanced grammar error correction (GEC) and detailed annotation to
identify specific error categories. Experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that these components significantly improve the evaluation of
content relevance, language use, and overall ASA performance, highlighting the
benefits of using richer, more nuanced feature sets for holistic speaking
assessment.

Motivation: 现有安全评估和审核工具偏向英语等高资源语言，多数全球语言未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 创建手动标注的波兰语基准数据集和对抗性扰动样本，评估不同架构和大小的LLM及分类器模型，包括Llama-Guard-3-8B、HerBERT和PLLuM。

Result: 基于HerBERT的分类器在对抗条件下表现最优。

Conclusion: 研究为波兰语模型安全评估提供了新工具，并验证了HerBERT在对抗环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite increasing efforts to ensure the safety of large language models
(LLMs), most existing safety assessments and moderation tools remain heavily
biased toward English and other high-resource languages, leaving majority of
global languages underexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a manually
annotated benchmark dataset for language model safety classification in Polish.
We also create adversarially perturbed variants of these samples designed to
challenge model robustness. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate
LLM-based and classifier-based models of varying sizes and architectures.
Specifically, we fine-tune three models: Llama-Guard-3-8B, a HerBERT-based
classifier (a Polish BERT derivative), and PLLuM, a Polish-adapted Llama-8B
model. We train these models using different combinations of annotated data and
evaluate their performance, comparing it against publicly available guard
models. Results demonstrate that the HerBERT-based classifier achieves the
highest overall performance, particularly under adversarial conditions.

Motivation: 评估MFC框架在不同文化背景（巴西）中的适用性，以理解政治语言如何塑造观点。

Method: 引入FrameNews-PT数据集，基于MFC框架对巴西政治经济新闻进行多轮标注，并评估模型在跨域数据上的表现。

Result: MFC框架基本适用，但需少量修订；某些框架使用较少，新议题需依赖通用框架。

Conclusion: 跨文化框架应用需谨慎考虑。

Abstract: Frames capture aspects of an issue that are emphasized in a debate by
interlocutors and can help us understand how political language conveys
different perspectives and ultimately shapes people's opinions. The Media Frame
Corpus (MFC) is the most commonly used framework with categories and detailed
guidelines for operationalizing frames. It is, however, focused on a few
salient U.S. news issues, making it unclear how well these frames can capture
news issues in other cultural contexts. To explore this, we introduce
FrameNews-PT, a dataset of Brazilian Portuguese news articles covering
political and economic news and annotate it within the MFC framework. Through
several annotation rounds, we evaluate the extent to which MFC frames
generalize to the Brazilian debate issues. We further evaluate how fine-tuned
and zero-shot models perform on out-of-domain data. Results show that the 15
MFC frames remain broadly applicable with minor revisions of the guidelines.
However, some MFC frames are rarely used, and novel news issues are analyzed
using general 'fall-back' frames. We conclude that cross-cultural frame use
requires careful consideration.

Conclusion: 知识图谱信息对关系抽取任务具有重要价值，尤其在数据不平衡场景下。

Abstract: We examine the impact of incorporating knowledge graph information on the
performance of relation extraction models across a range of datasets. Our
hypothesis is that the positions of entities within a knowledge graph provide
important insights for relation extraction tasks. We conduct experiments on
multiple datasets, each varying in the number of relations, training examples,
and underlying knowledge graphs. Our results demonstrate that integrating
knowledge graph information significantly enhances performance, especially when
dealing with an imbalance in the number of training examples for each relation.
We evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph-based features by combining
established relation extraction methods with graph-aware Neural Bellman-Ford
networks. These features are tested in both supervised and zero-shot settings,

Result: 性能优于现有生成模型，尤其在长尾关系上表现突出，且效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为信息抽取提供了更准确高效的解决方案，尤其适用于大规模场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for closed information extraction. The
method employs a discriminative approach that incorporates type and
entity-specific information to improve relation extraction accuracy,
particularly benefiting long-tail relations. Notably, this method demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end generative models.
This is especially evident for the problem of large-scale closed information
extraction where we are confronted with millions of entities and hundreds of
relations. Furthermore, we emphasize the efficiency aspect by leveraging
smaller models. In particular, the integration of type-information proves
instrumental in achieving performance levels on par with or surpassing those of
a larger generative model. This advancement holds promise for more accurate and
efficient information extraction techniques.

Conclusion: LLMs的表示能力需结合结构对应和任务表现，但其文本局限性仍是挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 produce compelling responses to a
wide range of prompts. But their representational capacities are uncertain.
Many LLMs have no direct contact with extra-linguistic reality: their inputs,
outputs and training data consist solely of text, raising the questions (1) can
LLMs represent anything and (2) if so, what? In this paper, I explore what it
would take to answer these questions according to a structural-correspondence
based account of representation, and make an initial survey of this evidence. I
argue that the mere existence of structural correspondences between LLMs and
worldly entities is insufficient to ground representation of those entities.
However, if these structural correspondences play an appropriate role - they
are exploited in a way that explains successful task performance - then they
could ground real world contents. This requires overcoming a challenge: the
text-boundedness of LLMs appears, on the face of it, to prevent them engaging
in the right sorts of tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS系统在控制副语言信息（如音色、情感、韵律）时灵活性不足，而现有指令驱动的TTS模型缺乏高质量评估基准和自动化指标。

Method: 引入InstructTTSEval基准，包含三个任务（声学参数指定、描述性风格指令、角色扮演），共6k测试用例，并使用Gemini作为自动评估工具。

Result: 评估显示当前指令驱动的TTS系统在复杂指令执行上仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: InstructTTSEval有望推动更强大、灵活和准确的指令驱动TTS系统的发展。

Abstract: In modern speech synthesis, paralinguistic information--such as a speaker's
vocal timbre, emotional state, and dynamic prosody--plays a critical role in
conveying nuance beyond mere semantics. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems rely on fixed style labels or inserting a speech prompt to control
these cues, which severely limits flexibility. Recent attempts seek to employ
natural-language instructions to modulate paralinguistic features,
substantially improving the generalization of instruction-driven TTS models.
Although many TTS systems now support customized synthesis via textual
description, their actual ability to interpret and execute complex instructions
remains largely unexplored. In addition, there is still a shortage of
high-quality benchmarks and automated evaluation metrics specifically designed
for instruction-based TTS, which hinders accurate assessment and iterative
optimization of these models. To address these limitations, we introduce
InstructTTSEval, a benchmark for measuring the capability of complex
natural-language style control. We introduce three tasks, namely
Acoustic-Parameter Specification, Descriptive-Style Directive, and Role-Play,
including English and Chinese subsets, each with 1k test cases (6k in total)
paired with reference audio. We leverage Gemini as an automatic judge to assess
their instruction-following abilities. Our evaluation of accessible
instruction-following TTS systems highlights substantial room for further
improvement. We anticipate that InstructTTSEval will drive progress toward more
powerful, flexible, and accurate instruction-following TTS.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM), a critical subfield of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), focuses on extracting argumentative structures from text. The advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced
in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain
adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in
LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and
annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A
key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how
contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning,
and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further
detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess
evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context
reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we
highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for
LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide
researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.

TL;DR: RiOT是一种新型自动提示优化框架，通过文本梯度和树结构解决现有方法缺乏多样性和语义漂移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法存在多样性不足和语义漂移问题，限制了探索创新方向和多任务性能。

Method: RiOT通过迭代文本梯度生成多样化候选提示，利用困惑度选择最佳提示，并引入文本残差连接缓解语义漂移。树结构管理优化过程。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，RiOT优于现有自动优化方法和手动提示。

Conclusion: RiOT通过多样性和语义保留机制，显著提升了提示优化的效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their
potential across a variety of tasks, but their performance still heavily relies
on the design of effective prompts. Existing methods for automatic prompt
optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration
of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations
for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we
propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic
prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients,
generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects
the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text
residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining
beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently
manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
Extensive experiments across five benchmarks, covering commonsense,
mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning, demonstrate that RiOT
outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模型协作标注的新范式AutoAnnotator，通过结合LLMs和SLMs的优势，显著降低了标注成本并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在大规模标注中的高成本和细粒度语义理解任务中准确性不足的问题。

Method: 设计了双层框架：上层元控制器层利用LLMs选择SLMs并验证困难样本；下层任务专家层通过多模型投票进行标注，并通过持续学习策略优化SLMs。

Result: AutoAnnotator在多种设置下优于现有方法，标注成本降低74.15%，准确性提高6.21%。

Conclusion: AutoAnnotator为高效、低成本的大规模标注提供了可行方案，同时提升了准确性。

Abstract: Although the annotation paradigm based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
made significant breakthroughs in recent years, its actual deployment still has
two core bottlenecks: first, the cost of calling commercial APIs in large-scale
annotation is very expensive; second, in scenarios that require fine-grained
semantic understanding, such as sentiment classification and toxicity
classification, the annotation accuracy of LLMs is even lower than that of
Small Language Models (SLMs) dedicated to this field. To address these
problems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and
design a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.
Specifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level
meta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to
select SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify
difficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple
SLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use
the difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller
layer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages
through a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of
SLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing
open-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.
Notably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to
directly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by
6.21%. Project page: https://github.com/Zhaiyuan-Ji/AutoAnnotator.

Motivation: 现有代码基准无法全面评估大型语言模型在竞争级别的代码推理能力，因此需要更严格的测试标准。

Method: 引入OJBench，包含232个来自NOI和ICPC的编程竞赛问题，对37种模型进行全面评估。

Result: 即使是先进的推理导向模型（如o4-mini和Gemini-2.5-pro-exp）在竞争级别问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 竞争级别的代码推理对模型仍具挑战性，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in math and code reasoning capabilities. However, existing
code benchmark are limited in their ability to evaluate the full spectrum of
these capabilities, particularly at the competitive level. To bridge this gap,
we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the
competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232
programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous
test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models,
reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that
even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and
Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level
problems. This highlights the significant challenges that models face in
competitive-level code reasoning.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长文本任务中的性能问题，分析失败模式并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出理论框架，将失败模式分为三类（任务噪声、模型噪声、聚合噪声），并通过多代理分块处理实验验证。

Result: 实验表明多代理分块处理在特定条件下优于单次处理，尤其是对超长输入。

Conclusion: 通过分块和聚合策略，可以有效处理长上下文任务，为LLMs的长文本应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to long
texts. We propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes the failure modes
of long context tasks into three categories: cross-chunk dependence (task
noise), confusion that grows with context size (model noise), and the imperfect
integration of partial results (aggregator noise). Under this view, we analyze
when it is effective to use multi-agent chunking, i.e., dividing a length
sequence into smaller chunks and aggregating the processed results of each
chunk. Our experiments on tasks such as retrieval, question answering, and
summarization confirm both the theoretical analysis and the conditions that
favor multi-agent chunking. By exploring superlinear model noise growth with
input length, we also explain why, for large inputs, a weaker model configured
with chunk-based processing can surpass a more advanced model like GPT4o
applied in a single shot. Overall, we present a principled understanding
framework and our results highlight a direct pathway to handling long contexts
in LLMs with carefully managed chunking and aggregator strategies.

TL;DR: REIS是一种针对RAG的存储内处理系统，通过优化数据库布局、数据放置和ANNS引擎，显著提升了检索性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的知识受限于训练数据，RAG通过外部知识库补充静态知识，但检索阶段成为瓶颈。现有ISP技术未针对RAG优化，且硬件修改复杂。

Method: REIS采用三种机制：优化数据库布局、ISP定制的数据放置技术和轻量级ANNS引擎，利用存储系统现有计算资源。

Result: 与服务器级系统相比，REIS平均提升检索性能13倍，能效55倍。

Conclusion: REIS为RAG提供了一种高效的ISP解决方案，显著降低了检索开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face an inherent challenge: their knowledge is
confined to the data that they have been trained on. To overcome this issue,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived
knowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three
stages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes
a significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is
mapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)
algorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant
items. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement
overheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these
overheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that
accelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing
works that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to
ISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected
by ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting
performance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system
tailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.
First, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to
their associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables
efficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that
distributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a
lightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that
uses the existing computational resources inside the storage system. Compared
to a server-grade system, REIS improves the performance (energy efficiency) of
retrieval by an average of 13x (55x).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长故事生成因连贯性和复杂性对现有大语言模型构成挑战，需解决情节一致性和叙事交织问题。

Method: 采用三模块多智能体框架：提纲、规划和写作智能体，分别负责生成事件大纲、详细规划和动态写作。

Result: StoryWriter在质量和长度上显著优于基线，并生成了6000篇高质量长故事数据集。

Conclusion: StoryWriter框架及其衍生模型在长故事生成中表现优异，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Long story generation remains a challenge for existing large language models
(LLMs), primarily due to two main factors: (1) discourse coherence, which
requires plot consistency, logical coherence, and completeness in the long-form
generation, and (2) narrative complexity, which requires an interwoven and
engaging narrative. To address these challenges, we propose StoryWriter, a
multi-agent story generation framework, which consists of three main modules:
(1) outline agent, which generates event-based outlines containing rich event
plots, character, and event-event relationships. (2) planning agent, which
further details events and plans which events should be written in each chapter
to maintain an interwoven and engaging story. (3) writing agent, which
dynamically compresses the story history based on the current event to generate
and reflect new plots, ensuring the coherence of the generated story. We
conduct both human and automated evaluation, and StoryWriter significantly
outperforms existing story generation baselines in both story quality and
length. Furthermore, we use StoryWriter to generate a dataset, which contains
about $6,000$ high-quality long stories, with an average length of $8,000$
words. We train the model Llama3.1-8B and GLM4-9B using supervised fine-tuning
on LongStory and develop StoryWriter_GLM and StoryWriter_GLM, which
demonstrates advanced performance in long story generation.

Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论对社会媒体平台构成严峻挑战，现有研究多关注显式有害言论，而缺乏对隐式仇恨言论的通用检测方法。

Method: 方法包括三个关键步骤：影响力样本识别、重新标注以及使用Llama-3 70B和GPT-4o进行数据增强。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在隐式仇恨言论检测上比基线提升了12.9个F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，为未来的研究和应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech has recently emerged as a critical challenge for social
media platforms. While much of the research has traditionally focused on
harmful speech in general, the need for generalizable techniques to detect
veiled and subtle forms of hate has become increasingly pressing. Based on
lexicon analysis, we hypothesize that implicit hate speech is already present
in publicly available harmful speech datasets but may not have been explicitly
recognized or labeled by annotators. Additionally, crowdsourced datasets are
prone to mislabeling due to the complexity of the task and often influenced by
annotators' subjective interpretations. In this paper, we propose an approach
to address the detection of implicit hate speech and enhance generalizability
across diverse datasets by leveraging existing harmful speech datasets. Our
method comprises three key components: influential sample identification,
reannotation, and augmentation using Llama-3 70B and GPT-4o. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving implicit
hate detection, achieving a +12.9-point F1 score improvement compared to the
baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多语言奖励模型主要基于高资源语言的偏好数据，导致对低资源印度语言的奖励信号不可靠，而收集这些语言的大规模高质量偏好数据成本过高。

Method: RELIC训练一个检索器，通过成对排序目标从辅助高资源语言中选择最能区分偏好和非偏好响应的上下文示例。

Result: 在三个偏好数据集上的实验表明，RELIC显著提高了低资源印度语言的奖励模型准确性，优于现有示例选择方法。例如，在Bodo语言上，RELIC比零样本提示和最先进的示例选择方法分别提高了12.81%和10.13%的准确性。

Conclusion: RELIC为解决低资源语言奖励建模问题提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human preferences. However, most open-source multilingual reward models are
primarily trained on preference datasets in high-resource languages, resulting
in unreliable reward signals for low-resource Indic languages. Collecting
large-scale, high-quality preference data for these languages is prohibitively
expensive, making preference-based training approaches impractical. To address
this challenge, we propose RELIC, a novel in-context learning framework for
reward modeling in low-resource Indic languages. RELIC trains a retriever with
a pairwise ranking objective to select in-context examples from auxiliary
high-resource languages that most effectively highlight the distinction between
preferred and less-preferred responses. Extensive experiments on three
preference datasets- PKU-SafeRLHF, WebGPT, and HH-RLHF-using state-of-the-art
open-source reward models demonstrate that RELIC significantly improves reward
model accuracy for low-resource Indic languages, consistently outperforming
existing example selection methods. For example, on Bodo-a low-resource Indic
language-using a LLaMA-3.2-3B reward model, RELIC achieves a 12.81% and 10.13%
improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting and state-of-the-art example
selection method, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统因训练数据偏向主流语言变体而难以处理区域方言，区域偏见研究不足。

Method: 采用两阶段分析：手动错误分析识别关键错误类型；案例研究聚焦方言代词识别。

Result: ASR错误与方言特征直接相关，社会因素影响较小。

Conclusion: 建议增加ASR训练数据的方言多样性，并利用社会语言学分析解决区域偏见。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle with regional dialects
due to biased training which favours mainstream varieties. While previous
research has identified racial, age, and gender biases in ASR, regional bias
remains underexamined. This study investigates ASR performance on Newcastle
English, a well-documented regional dialect known to be challenging for ASR. A
two-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample
identified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR
misrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR
recognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''. Results show that
ASR errors directly correlate with regional dialectal features, while social
factors play a lesser role in ASR mismatches. We advocate for greater dialectal
diversity in ASR training data and highlight the value of sociolinguistic
analysis in diagnosing and addressing regional biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络语音识别模型需持续吸收新数据而不重新训练整个系统，但无排练、多语言和语言无关条件下易导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 受人类大脑醒睡循环启发，提出两阶段方法：因子化阶段学习知识，中心化阶段合并知识，通过低秩适配器积累知识。

Result: 在多种代码切换数据集上的实验表明，中心化阶段能有效防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法通过两阶段学习机制，成功解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Modern neural network based speech recognition models are required to
continually absorb new data without re-training the whole system, especially in
downstream applications using foundation models, having no access to the
original training data. Continually training the models in a rehearsal-free,
multilingual, and language agnostic condition, likely leads to catastrophic
forgetting, when a seemingly insignificant disruption to the weights can
destructively harm the quality of the models. Inspired by the ability of human
brains to learn and consolidate knowledge through the waking-sleeping cycle, we
propose a continual learning approach with two distinct phases: factorization
and centralization, learning and merging knowledge accordingly. Our experiments
on a sequence of varied code-switching datasets showed that the centralization
stage can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting by accumulating the
knowledge in multiple scattering low-rank adapters.

Abstract: We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms
non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity,
prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by
modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized

model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming
AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining
stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.

high-stakes applications. We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether
an LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing
consistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing
between prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation
approach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three
components: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model
instability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the
variability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than
superficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how
much of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model
instability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs
across diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater
share of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more
robust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do
not consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their
advantage in robustness is often modest. These findings highlight the
importance of moving beyond accuracy-based benchmarks toward semantic
diagnostics that more directly assess the structure and stability of a model's
internal understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种计算框架，用于建模公众对科学新闻的感知，并通过大规模数据集和NLP模型预测公众反应。研究发现，科学新闻的消费频率是感知的主要驱动因素，而感知分数与公众参与度直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学传播中公众感知的复杂性需要更深入的理解和预测工具，以提升科学信息的传播效果。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，建模12个维度的公众感知，并创建了一个包含10,489个注释的大规模数据集。使用NLP模型预测感知分数，并通过Reddit实验验证感知与公众参与的关系。

Result: 科学新闻消费频率是感知的主要驱动因素，感知分数与公众参与度（如评论和点赞）显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究强调了感知建模在科学传播中的重要性，为预测公众兴趣和参与提供了新途径。

Abstract: Effectively engaging the public with science is vital for fostering trust and
understanding in our scientific community. Yet, with an ever-growing volume of
information, science communicators struggle to anticipate how audiences will
perceive and interact with scientific news. In this paper, we introduce a
computational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,
such as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,
we create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations
from 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable
insights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We
further develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong
performance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of
science from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors
affect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a
predictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement
with science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption
is the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal
influence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully
designed natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public
perception of scientific information has direct connections with the final
engagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive
significantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different
scientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.
Overall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception
modeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public
interest and engagement with scientific content.

### [50] [Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16628)
*Jianlin Shi,Brian T. Bucher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）辅助开发基于规则的临床NLP系统的新方法，显著提高了开发效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习和大语言模型发展迅速，但基于规则的NLP系统因其可解释性和操作效率在临床环境中仍占重要地位。然而，其手动开发和维护成本高，尤其是在语言变异性大的任务中。

Method: 研究提出了一种新方法，仅在基于规则的系统开发阶段使用LLM，重点关注从临床笔记中提取相关片段和关键词，用于命名实体识别（NER）。

Result: 实验结果显示，在识别临床相关文本片段（Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99）和提取NER关键词（1.0）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为NLP开发提供了新方向，能够半自动或自动化开发基于规则的系统，比基于深度学习模型的解决方案更快、更经济且更透明。

Abstract: Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs),
rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical
settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However,
their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in
tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems
development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first
two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from
the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the
rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments
demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text
snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER.
This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development,
enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with
significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared
with deep learning model-based solutions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多模态推理任务GeoGuess，通过结合局部细节和全局上下文进行层次化视觉推理，并引入数据集GeoExplain和方法SightSense。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务在多模态推理中缺乏对层次化视觉线索的讨论，而GeoGuess任务旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了SightSense方法，结合层次化视觉信息和外部知识进行多模态推理。

Result: 实验表明SightSense在GeoGuess任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GeoGuess任务和方法SightSense为多模态推理提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning is a process of understanding, integrating and inferring
information across different data modalities. It has recently attracted surging
academic attention as a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although
there are various tasks for evaluating multimodal reasoning ability, they still
have limitations. Lack of reasoning on hierarchical visual clues at different
levels of granularity, e.g., local details and global context, is of little
discussion, despite its frequent involvement in real scenarios. To bridge the
gap, we introduce a novel and challenging task for multimodal reasoning, namely
GeoGuess. Given a street view image, the task is to identify its location and
provide a detailed explanation. A system that succeeds in GeoGuess should be
able to detect tiny visual clues, perceive the broader landscape, and associate
with vast geographic knowledge. Therefore, GeoGuess would require the ability
to reason between hierarchical visual information and geographic knowledge. In
this work, we establish a benchmark for GeoGuess by introducing a specially
curated dataset GeoExplain which consists of
panoramas-geocoordinates-explanation tuples. Additionally, we present a
multimodal and multilevel reasoning method, namely SightSense which can make
prediction and generate comprehensive explanation based on hierarchy of visual
information and external knowledge. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate
their outstanding performance in GeoGuess.

*Pavlo Vasylenko,Marcos Treviso,André F. T. Martins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稀疏注意力机制ASEntmax，通过可学习的温度参数改进传统softmax的注意力分散问题，并结合位置编码提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax注意力机制在长序列任务中会导致注意力分散和表示崩溃，影响固定模式任务的精确性。

Method: 引入ASEntmax稀疏注意力机制，结合可学习温度参数和优化的位置编码设计。

Result: ASEntmax在长上下文泛化任务中显著优于softmax及其变体。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力机制和优化的位置编码能有效提升模型在长序列任务中的表现。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures traditionally employ softmax to compute
attention weights, which produces dense distributions over all tokens in a
sequence. While effective in many settings, this density has been shown to be
detrimental for tasks that demand precise focus on fixed-size patterns: as
sequence length increases, non-informative tokens accumulate attention
probability mass, leading to dispersion and representational collapse. We show
in this paper that sparse attention mechanisms using $\alpha$-entmax can avoid
these issues, due to their ability to assign exact zeros to irrelevant tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive-Scalable Entmax (ASEntmax), which endows
$\alpha$-entmax with a learnable temperature parameter, allowing the attention
distribution to interpolate between sparse (pattern-focused) and dense
(softmax-like) regimes. Finally, we show that the ability to locate and
generalize fixed-size patterns can be further improved through a careful design
of position encodings, which impacts both dense and sparse attention methods.
By integrating ASEntmax into standard transformer layers alongside proper
positional encodings, we show that our models greatly outperform softmax,
scalable softmax, and fixed-temperature $\alpha$-entmax baselines on
long-context generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种偏好对齐的路由框架Arch-Router，用于根据用户定义的领域或动作类型选择LLM，解决了现有路由方法在主观评价和模型选择上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法在评估性能和模型选择上存在不足，无法充分捕捉人类主观偏好。

Method: 提出Arch-Router，一个1.5B的紧凑模型，通过学习查询与领域-动作偏好的映射来指导路由决策。

Result: 在对话数据集上实现了SOTA性能，优于顶级专有模型。

Conclusion: Arch-Router能够更好地捕捉主观评价标准，提升路由决策的透明度和灵活性。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each
optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing
has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different
models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways:
they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human
preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select
from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned
routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to
user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) --
offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions.
Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that
learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions.
Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without
requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on
conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top
proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and
makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）的探测提取的句法特征无法预测其在英语语言现象中的下游句法表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何内部表示句法结构，并验证探测提取的句法特征是否能预测模型的实际句法表现。

Method: 采用“机制与结果”框架，评估32个开源Transformer模型，比较探测提取的句法特征与下游句法任务的表现。

Result: 探测提取的句法特征与下游句法任务表现无显著关联，表明潜在句法表示与可观察行为存在脱节。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了探测方法在预测LLMs实际句法行为上的局限性，需进一步探索更有效的解释性方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a robust mastery of syntax when
processing and generating text. While this suggests internalized understanding
of hierarchical syntax and dependency relations, the precise mechanism by which
they represent syntactic structure is an open area within interpretability
research. Probing provides one way to identify the mechanism of syntax being
linearly encoded in activations, however, no comprehensive study has yet
established whether a model's probing accuracy reliably predicts its downstream
syntactic performance. Adopting a "mechanisms vs. outcomes" framework, we
evaluate 32 open-weight transformer models and find that syntactic features
extracted via probing fail to predict outcomes of targeted syntax evaluations
across English linguistic phenomena. Our results highlight a substantial
disconnect between latent syntactic representations found via probing and
observable syntactic behaviors in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究立法者政治意识形态对政策制定的影响，尤其是交通相关立法。

Method: 使用LegiGPT框架，结合GPT-4和XAI技术，通过多阶段过滤和分类分析立法提案。

Result: 保守派和进步派赞助者数量、选区规模和选民人口是立法结果的关键因素。

Conclusion: LegiGPT为理解立法动态和政策制定提供了新工具，对基础设施规划和治理有广泛意义。

Abstract: Given the significant influence of lawmakers' political ideologies on
legislative decision-making, understanding their impact on policymaking is
critically important. We introduce a novel framework, LegiGPT, which integrates
a large language model (LLM) with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to
analyze transportation-related legislative proposals. LegiGPT employs a
multi-stage filtering and classification pipeline using zero-shot prompting
with GPT-4. Using legislative data from South Korea's 21st National Assembly,
we identify key factors - including sponsor characteristics, political
affiliations, and geographic variables - that significantly influence
transportation policymaking. The LLM was used to classify
transportation-related bill proposals through a stepwise filtering process
based on keywords, phrases, and contextual relevance. XAI techniques were then
applied to examine relationships between party affiliation and associated
attributes. The results reveal that the number and proportion of conservative
and progressive sponsors, along with district size and electoral population,
are critical determinants shaping legislative outcomes. These findings suggest
that both parties contributed to bipartisan legislation through different forms
of engagement, such as initiating or supporting proposals. This integrated
approach provides a valuable tool for understanding legislative dynamics and
guiding future policy development, with broader implications for infrastructure
planning and governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasonGRM是一个三阶段生成奖励模型框架，通过改进推理路径和引入新评估指标，显著提升了生成奖励模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成奖励模型（GRMs）在捕捉人类偏好方面比标量奖励模型更灵活，但其推理能力不足，导致推理路径不完整或过于推测性。

Method: ReasonGRM采用三阶段框架：1）Zero-RL生成简洁的推理路径；2）引入$R^\star$评分指标；3）通过强化学习进一步优化模型。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，ReasonGRM平均优于先前最佳GRMs 1.8%，并超越GPT-4o等专有模型高达5.6%。

Conclusion: ReasonGRM展示了推理感知训练的有效性，并强调了高质量推理选择对可靠偏好建模的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) provide greater flexibility than scalar
reward models in capturing human preferences, but their effectiveness is
limited by poor reasoning capabilities. This often results in incomplete or
overly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key
information in complex tasks. We address this challenge with ReasonGRM, a
three-stage generative reward modeling framework. In the first stage, Zero-RL
is used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the
likelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
evaluation metric, $R^\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their
generation likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with
minimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during
training. In the final stage, the model is further refined through
reinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference
discrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that
ReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
previous best GRMs by 1.8\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such
as GPT-4o by up to 5.6\%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
reasoning-aware training and highlight the importance of high-quality rationale
selection for reliable preference modeling.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在大型语言模型（LLMs）中如何准确评估认知不确定性，并探讨了提示偏差对不确定性的影响。实验表明，降低提示偏差可以改善GPT-4o的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在开放任务中的广泛应用，准确评估认知不确定性（反映模型知识不足）对确保可靠结果至关重要。然而，由于存在多答案导致的随机不确定性，量化认知不确定性具有挑战性。

Method: 通过视觉问答（VQA）任务实验，分析了提示偏差对GPT-4o和Qwen2-VL模型中认知和随机不确定性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，所有考虑的偏差在模型置信度较低时对两种不确定性的影响更大。低置信度会导致认知不确定性的低估（过度自信），但对随机不确定性的方向无显著影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对偏差缓解在不确定性量化中作用的理解，并为开发更先进的技术提供了潜在指导。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for open-ended
tasks, accurately assessing epistemic uncertainty, which reflects a model's
lack of knowledge, has become crucial to ensuring reliable outcomes. However,
quantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the
presence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.
While bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may
also reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we
conduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that
mitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in
GPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information
when model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect
measured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free
confidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases
induce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is
lower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater
underestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,
whereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric
uncertainty estimation. These distinct effects deepen our understanding of bias
mitigation for uncertainty quantification and potentially inform the
development of more advanced techniques.

Conclusion: LM-SPT通过语义蒸馏和架构改进，显著提升了语音标记化的语义对齐和任务性能。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech
tokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling
unified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim
to isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with
language models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as
HuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a
semantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture
content-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token
sequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating
challenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a
natural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across
frames, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM
alignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method
that introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching
teacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from
semantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded
representations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a
frozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet
data-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are
more semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates
architectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,
and supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.
Experimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity
compared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve
competitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform
baselines on text-to-speech tasks.

Method: LIRAS框架结合多模态语言模型解析输入，生成统一符号表示，并运行贝叶斯逆规划引擎。

Result: 在多个社交推理任务中，LIRAS表现优于现有模型，更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LIRAS为多模态社交推理提供了有效框架，尤其在语言和视觉结合的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Drawing real world social inferences usually requires taking into account
information from multiple modalities. Language is a particularly powerful
source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where
language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics
and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed.
In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a
framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate
linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a
process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment
representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and
visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian
inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments.
On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive
science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively
lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing
human judgments across all domains.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了ESC中的社交动态，导致模拟效果不佳。SocialSim旨在通过社交披露和社交意识提升ESC的模拟效果。

Method: SocialSim框架通过构建全面的角色库（社交披露）和激发认知推理（社交意识）来模拟ESC，并生成合成数据集SSConv。

Result: SSConv数据集质量超越众包数据，基于其训练的聊天机器人在自动和人工评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: SocialSim为ESC提供了一种可扩展的合成方法，使情感关怀更易实现。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) helps reduce people's psychological
stress and provide emotional value through interactive dialogues. Due to the
high cost of crowdsourcing a large ESC corpus, recent attempts use large
language models for dialogue augmentation. However, existing approaches largely
overlook the social dynamics inherent in ESC, leading to less effective
simulations. In this paper, we introduce SocialSim, a novel framework that
simulates ESC by integrating key aspects of social interactions: social
disclosure and social awareness. On the seeker side, we facilitate social
disclosure by constructing a comprehensive persona bank that captures diverse
and authentic help-seeking scenarios. On the supporter side, we enhance social
awareness by eliciting cognitive reasoning to generate logical and supportive
responses. Building upon SocialSim, we construct SSConv, a large-scale
synthetic ESC corpus of which quality can even surpass crowdsourced ESC data.
We further train a chatbot on SSConv and demonstrate its state-of-the-art
performance in both automatic and human evaluations. We believe SocialSim
offers a scalable way to synthesize ESC, making emotional care more accessible
and practical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒越狱方法易被检测且效率低，CAMO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将恶意提示分解为语义无害的视觉和文本片段，利用跨模态推理重构有害指令。

Result: CAMO在主流LVLMs上表现优异，具有高效性和跨模型迁移能力。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制存在显著漏洞，亟需更先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance
across multimodal tasks, yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety mechanisms to elicit restricted content generation. Existing
black-box jailbreak methods primarily rely on adversarial textual prompts or
image perturbations, yet these approaches are highly detectable by standard
content filtering systems and exhibit low query and computational efficiency.
In this work, we present Cross-modal Adversarial Multimodal Obfuscation (CAMO),
a novel black-box jailbreak attack framework that decomposes malicious prompts
into semantically benign visual and textual fragments. By leveraging LVLMs'
cross-modal reasoning abilities, CAMO covertly reconstructs harmful
instructions through multi-step reasoning, evading conventional detection
mechanisms. Our approach supports adjustable reasoning complexity and requires
significantly fewer queries than prior attacks, enabling both stealth and
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on leading LVLMs validate
CAMO's effectiveness, showcasing robust performance and strong cross-model
transferability. These results underscore significant vulnerabilities in
current built-in safety mechanisms, emphasizing an urgent need for advanced,
alignment-aware security and safety solutions in vision-language systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate
concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical
documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a
framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000
admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct
summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured
summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled
summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how
useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a
model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text
compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on
the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an
LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with
clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by
clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled
summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio)
and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet
to encourage future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIST的方法，通过迭代语义调优破解黑盒大语言模型，平衡语义相似性与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）已尝试与社会和道德价值观对齐，但仍易受破解攻击，现有方法因离散输入、受限访问和有限查询预算而难以实现。

Method: MIST通过迭代优化提示，保留原始语义意图的同时诱导有害内容，采用顺序同义词搜索和顺序确定优化两种策略。

Result: 实验表明，MIST在攻击成功率和转移性上优于其他方法，并验证了其计算效率的实用性。

Conclusion: MIST为破解黑盒LLMs提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite efforts to align large language models (LLMs) with societal and moral
values, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks--methods designed
to elicit harmful responses. Jailbreaking black-box LLMs is considered
challenging due to the discrete nature of token inputs, restricted access to
the target LLM, and limited query budget. To address the issues above, we
propose an effective method for jailbreaking black-box large language Models
via Iterative Semantic Tuning, named MIST. MIST enables attackers to
iteratively refine prompts that preserve the original semantic intent while
inducing harmful content. Specifically, to balance semantic similarity with
computational efficiency, MIST incorporates two key strategies: sequential
synonym search, and its advanced version--order-determining optimization.
Extensive experiments across two open-source models and four closed-source
models demonstrate that MIST achieves competitive attack success rates and
attack transferability compared with other state-of-the-art white-box and
black-box jailbreak methods. Additionally, we conduct experiments on
computational efficiency to validate the practical viability of MIST.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语言模型的样本效率，分析了不同架构和大小的模型在高低频事实上的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际文本中信息呈长尾分布，模型需高效学习并记忆高频和低频事实，样本效率是关键。

Method: 通过标注训练语料中关系事实的频率，比较不同模型在高低频事实上的表现。

Result: 多数模型在高频事实上表现相似，但在低频事实上差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型架构、大小与事实学习效率之间的关系。

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a crucial property of language models with practical
implications for training efficiency. In real-world text, information follows a
long-tailed distribution. Yet, we expect models to learn and recall frequent
and infrequent facts. Sample-efficient models are better equipped to handle
this challenge of learning and retaining rare information without requiring
excessive exposure. This study analyzes multiple models of varying
architectures and sizes, all trained on the same pre-training data. By
annotating relational facts with their frequencies in the training corpus, we
examine how model performance varies with fact frequency. Our findings show
that most models perform similarly on high-frequency facts but differ notably
on low-frequency facts. This analysis provides new insights into the
relationship between model architecture, size, and factual learning efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语言瓶颈模型（LBM）的知识追踪方法，通过生成可解释的自然语言摘要，提高预测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识追踪方法依赖不透明的潜在嵌入，可解释性差；LLM方法可能产生不准确的预测或摘要。

Method: 将知识追踪重构为逆问题，使用编码器LLM生成可解释的知识摘要，解码器LLM基于摘要预测学生回答。

Result: 在算术基准和Eedi数据集上，LBM的准确性媲美最先进方法，且所需学生轨迹数据更少。

Conclusion: LBM通过自然语言瓶颈确保摘要准确且可解释，优化编码器训练可进一步提升摘要质量。

Abstract: Accurately assessing student knowledge is critical for effective education,
yet traditional Knowledge Tracing (KT) methods rely on opaque latent
embeddings, limiting interpretability. Even LLM-based approaches generate
direct predictions or summaries that may hallucinate without any accuracy
guarantees. We recast KT as an inverse problem: learning the minimum
natural-language summary that makes past answers explainable and future answers
predictable. Our Language Bottleneck Model (LBM) consists of an encoder LLM
that writes an interpretable knowledge summary and a frozen decoder LLM that
must reconstruct and predict student responses using only that summary text. By
constraining all predictive information to pass through a short
natural-language bottleneck, LBMs ensure that the summary contains accurate
information while remaining human-interpretable. Experiments on synthetic
arithmetic benchmarks and the large-scale Eedi dataset show that LBMs rival the
accuracy of state-of-the-art KT and direct LLM methods while requiring
orders-of-magnitude fewer student trajectories. We demonstrate that training
the encoder with group-relative policy optimization, using downstream decoding
accuracy as a reward signal, effectively improves summary quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试缺乏对LLMs生成LaTeX代码能力的评估，而LaTeX是科学文档排版的标准工具。

Method: 通过TeXpert数据集（包含多难度级别的自然语言提示），对开源和闭源LLMs在LaTeX生成任务中的表现进行深入分析。

Result: LLMs在复杂任务中表现显著下降；开源模型（如DeepSeek v3和DeepSeek Coder）与闭源模型表现接近；格式和包错误普遍。

Conclusion: LLMs在LaTeX生成任务中表现有限，训练数据中缺乏多样化LaTeX示例可能是主要原因。

Abstract: LaTeX's precision and flexibility in typesetting have made it the gold
standard for the preparation of scientific documentation. Large Language Models
(LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce
publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet
current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing
TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating
LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple
difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this
regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and
closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard
benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy
drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek
v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks;
and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack
of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset,

Abstract: The challenge of personalizing language models, specifically the ability to
account for a user's history during interactions, is of significant interest.
Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation that have enhanced the factual base of LLMs, the task of
retaining extensive personal information and using it to generate personalized
responses remains pertinent. To address this, we propose utilizing external
memory in the form of knowledge graphs, which are constructed and updated by
the LLM itself. We have expanded upon ideas of AriGraph architecture and for
the first time introduced a combined graph featuring both standard edges and
two types of hyperedges. Experiments conducted on the TriviaQA, HotpotQA and
DiaASQ benchmarks indicates that this approach aids in making the process of
graph construction and knowledge extraction unified and robust. Furthermore, we
augmented the DiaASQ benchmark by incorporating parameters such as time into
dialogues and introducing contradictory statements made by the same speaker at
different times. Despite these modifications, the performance of the
question-answering system remained robust, demonstrating the proposed
architecture's ability to maintain and utilize temporal dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成反馈对学习的影响，并与现有反馈方法进行比较。

Method: 通过分析885名学员的2,600多次课程完成情况，比较了接受GPT-3.5反馈、拒绝反馈和无反馈三组的学习效果，并使用倾向评分调整选择偏差。

Result: 两门课程中LLM反馈显著提升学习效果（效应量0.28和0.33），且学习者普遍认为反馈有帮助，未显著增加完成时间。

Conclusion: LLM反馈是一种低成本、可扩展的学习辅助工具，尤其在已有反馈系统中效果显著。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate feedback, yet
their impact on learning remains underexplored, especially compared to existing
feedback methods. This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated
explanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training
lessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we
compare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who
received feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those
without access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address
potential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined
to use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher
predicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher
at posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,
two out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits
from LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These
moderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the
learners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not
significantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as
helpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and
scalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing
systems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open
datasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.

Result: 评估19种先进多模态模型，发现其性能与人类水平存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 未来需研究更复杂的跨模态歧义理解方法，推动多模态推理的边界。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances across numerous vision-language tasks. Due to their strong image-text
alignment capability, MLLMs can effectively understand image-text pairs with
clear meanings. However, effectively resolving the inherent ambiguities in
natural language and visual contexts remains challenging. Existing multimodal
benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly
on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual
clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating
multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios.
MUCAR includes: (1) a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions
are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and (2) a
dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with
ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to
yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive
evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both
open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to
human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more
sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the
boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有微调方法在特定任务（如翻译）上表现优秀，但牺牲了通用能力（如对话推理和指令遵循），限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用多阶段训练方法（持续预训练、监督微调、偏好优化和强化学习），生成和筛选数据以提升翻译和通用任务性能。

Conclusion: Tower+证明在优化特定领域（如翻译）的同时，仍能匹敌前沿模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for
reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine
translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing
general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and
instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world
applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce
Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both
translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a
Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual
general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds
on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised
fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate
data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks
involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general
instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.
Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and
proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers
best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top
results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we
introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our
findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general
capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as
translation and localization.

Motivation: 探索CoT提示对LLM幻觉检测的影响，填补研究空白。

Result: CoT提示减少幻觉频率，但削弱检测信号，降低检测效果。

Conclusion: CoT提示在减少幻觉与检测效果之间存在权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit \textit{hallucinations},
generating factually incorrect or semantically irrelevant content in response
to prompts. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting can mitigate hallucinations by
encouraging step-by-step reasoning, but its impact on hallucination detection
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic empirical
evaluation. We begin with a pilot experiment, revealing that CoT reasoning
significantly affects the LLM's internal states and token probability
distributions. Building on this, we evaluate the impact of various CoT
prompting methods on mainstream hallucination detection methods across both
instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs. Specifically, we examine three
key dimensions: changes in hallucination score distributions, variations in
detection accuracy, and shifts in detection confidence. Our findings show that
while CoT prompting helps reduce hallucination frequency, it also tends to
obscure critical signals used for detection, impairing the effectiveness of
various detection methods. Our study highlights an overlooked trade-off in the
use of reasoning. Code is publicly available at:

Result: PILS方法在隐藏提示恢复上比现有方法提升2-3.5倍，恢复率从17%提高到60%，并在跨步数和跨模型任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言模型的下一词概率分布是反转攻击的脆弱点，PILS方法在安全性和泛化性上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Language model inversion seeks to recover hidden prompts using only language
model outputs. This capability has implications for security and accountability
in language model deployments, such as leaking private information from an
API-protected language model's system message. We propose a new method --
prompt inversion from logprob sequences (PILS) -- that recovers hidden prompts
by gleaning clues from the model's next-token probabilities over the course of
multiple generation steps. Our method is enabled by a key insight: The
vector-valued outputs of a language model occupy a low-dimensional subspace.
This enables us to losslessly compress the full next-token probability
distribution over multiple generation steps using a linear map, allowing more
output information to be used for inversion. Our approach yields massive gains
over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts, achieving
2--3.5 times higher exact recovery rates across test sets, in one case
increasing the recovery rate from 17% to 60%. Our method also exhibits
surprisingly good generalization behavior; for instance, an inverter trained on
16 generations steps gets 5--27 points higher prompt recovery when we increase
the number of steps to 32 at test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
performance of our method on the more challenging task of recovering hidden
system messages. We also analyze the role of verbatim repetition in prompt
recovery and propose a new method for cross-family model transfer for
logit-based inverters. Our findings show that next-token probabilities are a
considerably more vulnerable attack surface for inversion attacks than
previously known.

Motivation: 解决长上下文任务中KV缓存内存成本高的问题，统一评估现有方法的性能与内存占用。

Method: 提出*KV footprint*作为统一度量，改进*post-fill eviction*方法以支持预填充阶段驱逐，并提出PruLong优化*recency eviction*方法。

Result: 改进后的方法显著降低KV footprint，PruLong比现有方法减少12%内存占用且保持性能。

Conclusion: 论文为长上下文推理方法提供了清晰的评估框架，并为未来优化KV footprint指明了方向。

Abstract: Language models handle increasingly long contexts for tasks such as book
summarization, but this leads to growing memory costs for the key-value (KV)
cache. Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but
their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like
high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between
methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified
metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their
lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they
attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and
generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the
high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --
*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with
eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs
during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn
to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end
optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full
KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context
performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while
retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the
complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future
development to minimize the KV footprint.

TL;DR: CLEAR-3K是一个包含3000个断言-推理问题的数据集，用于评估语言模型是否能判断一个陈述是否因果解释另一个陈述。研究发现，模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，且随着参数增加，模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受因果关系，但性能提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估语言模型在区分语义相关性和真实因果解释关系方面的能力，为开发具备真实因果推理能力的模型提供基准。

Method: 通过CLEAR-3K数据集测试21种先进语言模型（参数规模从0.5B到72B），分析其对因果关系的判断能力。

Result: 模型常混淆语义相似性与因果关系，参数增加导致模型从过度怀疑转向过度接受，但性能仅达到马修斯相关系数0.55。

Conclusion: CLEAR-3K为开发具备真实因果推理能力的语言模型提供了重要基准，对需要准确评估因果关系的应用至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce CLEAR-3K, a dataset of 3,000 assertion-reasoning questions
designed to evaluate whether language models can determine if one statement
causally explains another. Each question present an assertion-reason pair and
challenge language models to distinguish between semantic relatedness and
genuine causal explanatory relationships. Through comprehensive evaluation of
21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we
identify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse
semantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap
instead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as
parameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical
about causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.
Despite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation
Coefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,
CLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine
causal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for
applications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the AI Search Paradigm, a comprehensive blueprint
for next-generation search systems capable of emulating human information
processing and decision-making. The paradigm employs a modular architecture of
four LLM-powered agents (Master, Planner, Executor and Writer) that dynamically
adapt to the full spectrum of information needs, from simple factual queries to
complex multi-stage reasoning tasks. These agents collaborate dynamically
through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems
into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content
synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this
paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies,
aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference,
spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations. By
providing an in-depth guide to these foundational components, this work aims to
inform the development of trustworthy, adaptive, and scalable AI search
systems.

*Kathleen C. Fraser,Hillary Dawkins,Isar Nejadgholi,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现微调通用大语言模型（LLM）会削弱其安全对齐功能，即使微调数据无害。安全评估结果对实验设置的微小变化表现出显著差异，需改进报告方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调LLM已成为常规操作，但会意外移除模型的安全对齐功能，导致潜在风险。需可靠的安全评估方法。

Method: 研究安全评估对实验设置微小变化的鲁棒性，分析LLM的随机性对结果的影响。

Result: 实验显示安全评估结果对微调设置的微小变化高度敏感，结果差异显著。

Conclusion: 需改进安全评估的报告方式，确保结果可比较，以应对微调带来的安全风险。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific
domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However,
fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even
when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider
this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of
fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most
well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM
with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily
exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make
any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and
reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a
safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and
the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising
variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly
inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations
have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report
results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.

TL;DR: LaMP-Cap是一个多模态数据集，用于个性化图标题生成，通过结合图像和文本信息提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成的图标题缺乏个性化和多模态支持，作者需手动调整以匹配风格和领域需求。

Method: 提出LaMP-Cap数据集，包含目标图像及其上下文的多模态信息（如图像、标题和相关段落），并测试了四种LLM。

Result: 实验表明，使用多模态上下文信息生成的标题更接近作者原创，且图像比文本段落更有帮助。

Conclusion: 多模态信息（尤其是图像）显著提升个性化图标题生成质量，优于纯文本方法。

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a
figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these
captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet,
authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match
their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for
personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances,
these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address
scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces
LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal
figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed
inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same
document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a
profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using
profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original
author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are
more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of
using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Motivation: 探索图像引导在点云补全任务中的必要性，并提出一种无需图像引导的强基线方法。

Method: 采用基于注意力的多分支编码器-解码器网络，结合层次化自融合机制（交叉注意力和自注意力层）整合多流信息。

Result: 在ShapeNet-ViPC数据集上，该方法性能优于现有单视角图像引导方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为多模态学习在点云补全任务中的发展提供了新见解。

Abstract: The single-view image guided point cloud completion (SVIPC) task aims to
reconstruct a complete point cloud from a partial input with the help of a
single-view image. While previous works have demonstrated the effectiveness of
this multimodal approach, the fundamental necessity of image guidance remains
largely unexamined. To explore this, we propose a strong baseline approach for
SVIPC based on an attention-based multi-branch encoder-decoder network that
only takes partial point clouds as input, view-free. Our hierarchical
self-fusion mechanism, driven by cross-attention and self-attention layers,
effectively integrates information across multiple streams, enriching feature
representations and strengthening the networks ability to capture geometric
structures. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ShapeNet-ViPC
dataset demonstrate that our view-free framework performs superiorly to
state-of-the-art SVIPC methods. We hope our findings provide new insights into
the development of multimodal learning in SVIPC. Our demo code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注VLM的准确性，而效率鲁棒性未充分探索，尤其是在实时应用和高推理开销的背景下。

Method: VLMInferSlow结合细粒度效率建模和零阶优化，生成对抗性图像以增加计算成本。

Result: 实验显示，VLMInferSlow生成的对抗图像可增加计算成本高达128.47%。

Conclusion: 该研究旨在提高社区对VLM效率鲁棒性的关注。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in real-world
applications. While existing research primarily focuses on improving their
accuracy, the efficiency remains underexplored. Given the real-time demands of
many applications and the high inference overhead of VLMs, efficiency
robustness is a critical issue. However, previous studies evaluate efficiency
robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model
architecture and parameters -- an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service
settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we
propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness
in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained
efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order
optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that
VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations,
increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%. We hope this research
raises the community's awareness about the efficiency robustness of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练模型，但动态视角识别能力不足，且微调预训练模型计算成本高。

Method: WPCL通过弱监督部分对比学习，将预训练VLM知识整合到感知过程中，避免微调。

Result: 实验表明，WPCL在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，验证了其有效性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: WPCL在提升VLN任务性能的同时，确保了计算效率。

Abstract: Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of
Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments
based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing
methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely
on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when
using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN
domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results,
their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning
(WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from
dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM
knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our
method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental
cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown
that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which
validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集的城市交通环境中，现有技术难以精确导航，而3D场景重建的高精度边界问题尚未完全解决。符号距离函数（SDF）因其高效存储特性成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 结合LiDAR数据和深度神经网络，开发了一种学习型的3D场景重建方法，生成静态SDF地图，替代传统的多边形表示。

Result: 初步结果表明，该方法能显著提升碰撞检测性能，尤其是在拥堵和动态环境中。

Conclusion: 该方法为密集交通环境中的高精度3D场景重建提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In crowded urban environments where traffic is dense, current technologies
struggle to oversee tight navigation, but surface-level understanding allows
autonomous vehicles to safely assess proximity to surrounding obstacles. 3D or
2D scene mapping of the surrounding objects is an essential task in addressing
the above problem. Despite its importance in dense vehicle traffic conditions,
3D scene reconstruction of object shapes with higher boundary level accuracy is
not yet entirely considered in current literature. The sign distance function
represents any shape through parameters that calculate the distance from any
point in space to the closest obstacle surface, making it more efficient in
terms of storage. In recent studies, researchers have started to formulate
problems with Implicit 3D reconstruction methods in the autonomous driving
domain, highlighting the possibility of using sign distance function to map
obstacles effectively. This research addresses this gap by developing a
learning-based 3D scene reconstruction methodology that leverages LiDAR data
and a deep neural network to build a the static Signed Distance Function (SDF)
maps. Unlike traditional polygonal representations, this approach has the
potential to map 3D obstacle shapes with more boundary-level details. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that this method would significantly enhance
collision detection performance, particularly in congested and dynamic
environments.

Motivation: 雾天严重影响自动驾驶和监控系统的视觉信息，需要一种能够适应不同雾密度的去雾方法。

Method: 使用轻量级雾密度估计网络（HDEN）分类雾密度，动态路由到三个CORUN分支，结合自适应损失优化物理模型和感知保真度。

Result: 在Cityscapes和RTTS基准测试中，PSNR提升2.1 dB，FADE降低30%，目标检测mAP提升13点，推理时间减少20%。

Conclusion: ADAM-Dehaze通过密度感知和动态处理，显著提升了雾天条件下的视觉任务性能，并优化了下游任务的表现。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, pose a significant challenge to
autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and other safety-critical
applications by severely degrading visual information. We introduce
ADAM-Dehaze, an adaptive, density-aware dehazing framework that jointly
optimizes image restoration and object detection under varying fog intensities.
A lightweight Haze Density Estimation Network (HDEN) classifies each input as
light, medium, or heavy fog. Based on this score, the system dynamically routes
the image through one of three CORUN branches: Light, Medium, or Complex, each
tailored to its haze regime. A novel adaptive loss balances physical-model
coherence and perceptual fidelity, ensuring both accurate defogging and
preservation of fine details. On Cityscapes and the real-world RTTS benchmark,
ADAM-Dehaze improves PSNR by up to 2.1 dB, reduces FADE by 30 percent, and
increases object detection mAP by up to 13 points, while cutting inference time
by 20 percent. These results highlight the importance of intensity-specific
processing and seamless integration with downstream vision tasks. Code

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型局限于单镜头创作，而实际应用需要多镜头且身份一致的视频生成。

Method: 提出EchoShot框架，采用镜头感知位置嵌入机制，并在视频扩散变换器架构中建模多镜头变化。构建PortraitGala数据集支持训练。

Result: EchoShot在多镜头肖像视频生成中表现出色，身份一致性和属性级可控性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EchoShot为多镜头视频建模提供了基础范式，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Video diffusion models substantially boost the productivity of artistic
workflows with high-quality portrait video generative capacity. However,
prevailing pipelines are primarily constrained to single-shot creation, while
real-world applications urge for multiple shots with identity consistency and
flexible content controllability. In this work, we propose EchoShot, a native
and scalable multi-shot framework for portrait customization built upon a
foundation video diffusion model. To start with, we propose shot-aware position
embedding mechanisms within video diffusion transformer architecture to model
inter-shot variations and establish intricate correspondence between multi-shot
visual content and their textual descriptions. This simple yet effective design
enables direct training on multi-shot video data without introducing additional
computational overhead. To facilitate model training within multi-shot
scenario, we construct PortraitGala, a large-scale and high-fidelity
human-centric video dataset featuring cross-shot identity consistency and
fine-grained captions such as facial attributes, outfits, and dynamic motions.
To further enhance applicability, we extend EchoShot to perform reference
image-based personalized multi-shot generation and long video synthesis with
infinite shot counts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EchoShot achieves
superior identity consistency as well as attribute-level controllability in
multi-shot portrait video generation. Notably, the proposed framework
demonstrates potential as a foundational paradigm for general multi-shot video
modeling.

Motivation: 希腊纸草文献的背景通常不均匀、碎片化且有色差，传统二值化方法难以处理，因此需要探索更有效的方法。

Method: 比较传统二值化方法与深度学习模型，结合自定义数据增强技术和不同模型选择标准，并在DIBCO 2019数据集上评估效果。

Result: 深度学习模型结合数据增强表现更优，二值化质量与作者识别性能密切相关。

Conclusion: 数据增强对深度学习方法至关重要，二值化效果直接影响下游作者识别任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper tackles the task of writer identification for Greek papyri. A
common preprocessing step in writer identification pipelines is image
binarization, which prevents the model from learning background features. This
is challenging in historical documents, in our case Greek papyri, as background
is often non-uniform, fragmented, and discolored with visible fiber structures.
We compare traditional binarization methods to state-of-the-art Deep Learning
(DL) models, evaluating the impact of binarization quality on subsequent writer
identification performance. DL models are trained with and without a custom
data augmentation technique, as well as different model selection criteria are
applied. The performance of these binarization methods, is then systematically
evaluated on the DIBCO 2019 dataset. The impact of binarization on writer
identification is subsequently evaluated using a state-of-the-art approach for
writer identification. The results of this analysis highlight the influence of
data augmentation for DL methods. Furthermore, findings indicate a strong
correlation between binarization effectiveness on papyri documents of DIBCO
2019 and downstream writer identification performance.

Motivation: 传统隐私保护技术（如模糊处理）无法完全防止个体追踪，隐私风险依然存在。

Result: 相比现有方法，隐私保护和文本质量显著提升，独特词数增加约77%，细节密度提高约50%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了AI摄像头隐私保护问题，同时保留了场景相关信息。

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) rely on a range of devices that
often process privacy-sensitive data. Among these, roadside units play a
critical role particularly through the use of AI-equipped (AIE) cameras for
applications such as violation detection. However, the privacy risks associated
with captured imagery remain a major concern, as such data can be misused for
identity theft, profiling, or unauthorized commercial purposes. While
traditional techniques such as face blurring and obfuscation have been applied
to mitigate privacy risks, individual privacy remains at risk, as individuals
can still be tracked using other features such as their clothing. This paper
introduces a novel privacy-preserving framework that leverages feedback-based
reinforcement learning (RL) and vision-language models (VLMs) to protect
sensitive visual information captured by AIE cameras. The main idea is to
convert images into semantically equivalent textual descriptions, ensuring that
scene-relevant information is retained while visual privacy is preserved. A
hierarchical RL strategy is employed to iteratively refine the generated text,
enhancing both semantic accuracy and privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate
significant improvements in both privacy protection and textual quality, with
the Unique Word Count increasing by approximately 77\% and Detail Density by
around 50\% compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 研究VLMs是否采用类似语言模型的符号化机制解决特征绑定问题，以解释其在绑定任务中的持续失败。

Method: 识别并分析VLMs中支持绑定的内容无关空间索引机制。

Result: 发现VLMs通过空间索引机制实现绑定，绑定错误源于这些机制的失效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs中符号化处理的机制，为解决其绑定失败问题提供了方向。

Abstract: To accurately process a visual scene, observers must bind features together
to represent individual objects. This capacity is necessary, for instance, to
distinguish an image containing a red square and a blue circle from an image
containing a blue square and a red circle. Recent work has found that language
models solve this 'binding problem' via a set of symbol-like,
content-independent indices, but it is unclear whether similar mechanisms are
employed by vision language models (VLMs). This question is especially
relevant, given the persistent failures of VLMs on tasks that require binding.
Here, we identify a set of emergent symbolic mechanisms that support binding in
VLMs via a content-independent, spatial indexing scheme. Moreover, we find that
binding errors can be traced directly to failures in these mechanisms. Taken
together, these results shed light on the mechanisms that support symbol-like
processing in VLMs, and suggest possible avenues for addressing the persistent
binding failures exhibited by these models.

Abstract: Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate and validate PanSegNet, a deep
learning (DL) algorithm for pediatric pancreas segmentation on MRI in children
with acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP), and healthy controls.
Methods: With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected 84 MRI scans (1.5T/3T
Siemens Aera/Verio) from children aged 2-19 years at Gazi University
(2015-2024). The dataset includes healthy children as well as patients
diagnosed with AP or CP based on clinical criteria. Pediatric and general
radiologists manually segmented the pancreas, then confirmed by a senior
pediatric radiologist. PanSegNet-generated segmentations were assessed using
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance
(HD95). Cohen's kappa measured observer agreement. Results: Pancreas MRI T2W
scans were obtained from 42 children with AP/CP (mean age: 11.73 +/- 3.9 years)
and 42 healthy children (mean age: 11.19 +/- 4.88 years). PanSegNet achieved
DSC scores of 88% (controls), 81% (AP), and 80% (CP), with HD95 values of 3.98
mm (controls), 9.85 mm (AP), and 15.67 mm (CP). Inter-observer kappa was 0.86
(controls), 0.82 (pancreatitis), and intra-observer agreement reached 0.88 and
0.81. Strong agreement was observed between automated and manual volumes (R^2 =
0.85 in controls, 0.77 in diseased), demonstrating clinical reliability.
Conclusion: PanSegNet represents the first validated deep learning solution for
pancreatic MRI segmentation, achieving expert-level performance across healthy
and diseased states. This tool, algorithm, along with our annotated dataset,
are freely available on GitHub and OSF, advancing accessible, radiation-free

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image and video demoir\'eing by
integrating Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with advanced deep learning
techniques. Demoir\'eing addresses inherently nonlinear degradation processes,
which pose significant challenges for existing methods.
  Traditional supervised learning approaches either fail to remove moir\'e
patterns completely or produce overly smooth results. This stems from
constrained model capacity and scarce training data, which inadequately
represent the clean image distribution and hinder accurate reconstruction of
ground-truth images. While generative models excel in image restoration for
linear degradations, they struggle with nonlinear cases such as demoir\'eing
and often introduce artifacts.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid MAP-based framework that
integrates two complementary components. The first is a supervised learning
model enhanced with efficient linear attention Test-Time Training (TTT)
modules, which directly learn nonlinear mappings for RAW-to-sRGB demoir\'eing.
The second is a Truncated Flow Matching Prior (TFMP) that further refines the
outputs by aligning them with the clean image distribution, effectively
restoring high-frequency details and suppressing artifacts. These two
components combine the computational efficiency of linear attention with the
refinement abilities of generative models, resulting in improved restoration
performance.

Result: VideoSync在公平条件下优于现有方法，并发现SeSyn-Net预处理中的偏差。

Conclusion: VideoSync推动了视频同步的通用性和鲁棒性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Video synchronization-aligning multiple video streams capturing the same
event from different angles-is crucial for applications such as reality TV show
production, sports analysis, surveillance, and autonomous systems. Prior work
has heavily relied on audio cues or specific visual events, limiting
applicability in diverse settings where such signals may be unreliable or
absent. Additionally, existing benchmarks for video synchronization lack
generality and reproducibility, restricting progress in the field. In this
work, we introduce VideoSync, a video synchronization framework that operates
independently of specific feature extraction methods, such as human pose
estimation, enabling broader applicability across different content types. We
evaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,
multi-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code
for dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals
biases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,
leading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a
more rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms
existing approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.
Additionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,
identifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most
effective. Our findings advance video synchronization beyond domain-specific
constraints, making it more generalizable and robust for real-world

Abstract: Global dependency modeling and spatial position modeling are two core issues
of the foundational architecture design in current deep learning frameworks.
Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in
computer vision, leveraging the powerful global dependency modeling capability
of the self-attention mechanism. Furthermore, Mamba2 has demonstrated its
significant potential in natural language processing tasks by explicitly
modeling the spatial adjacency prior through the structured mask. In this
paper, we propose Polyline Path Masked Attention (PPMA) that integrates the
self-attention mechanism of ViTs with an enhanced structured mask of Mamba2,
harnessing the complementary strengths of both architectures. Specifically, we
first ameliorate the traditional structured mask of Mamba2 by introducing a 2D
polyline path scanning strategy and derive its corresponding structured mask,
polyline path mask, which better preserves the adjacency relationships among
image tokens. Notably, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis on the
structural characteristics of the proposed polyline path mask and design an
efficient algorithm for the computation of the polyline path mask. Next, we
embed the polyline path mask into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs,
enabling explicit modeling of spatial adjacency prior. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks, including image classification, object detection, and
segmentation, demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art
approaches based on both state-space models and Transformers. For example, our
proposed PPMA-T/S/B models achieve 48.7%/51.1%/52.3% mIoU on the ADE20K
semantic segmentation task, surpassing RMT-T/S/B by 0.7%/1.3%/0.3%,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/zhongchenzhao/PPMA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的异构模态无监督域适应（HMUDA）方法，通过桥接域实现不同模态间的知识迁移，并设计了LSB框架用于语义分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决源域和目标域模态完全不同的无监督域适应问题。

Method: 提出LSB框架，采用双分支架构，结合特征一致性损失和域对齐损失。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上验证了LSB的优越性能。

Conclusion: LSB在异构模态无监督域适应中表现优异，为跨模态知识迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods effectively bridge domain gaps
but become struggled when the source and target domains belong to entirely
distinct modalities. To address this limitation, we propose a novel setting
called Heterogeneous-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (HMUDA), which
enables knowledge transfer between completely different modalities by
leveraging a bridge domain containing unlabeled samples from both modalities.
To learn under the HMUDA setting, we propose Latent Space Bridging (LSB), a
specialized framework designed for the semantic segmentation task.
Specifically, LSB utilizes a dual-branch architecture, incorporating a feature
consistency loss to align representations across modalities and a domain
alignment loss to reduce discrepancies between class centroids across domains.
Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSB
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Jingwei Zhang,Xi Han,Hong Qin,Mahdi S. Hosseini,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LBMamba是一种局部双向状态空间模型（SSM）块，通过嵌入轻量级局部反向扫描来消除额外计算负担，LBVim是其扩展，用于视觉任务，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba的单向性限制了其全局感知能力，双向扫描虽能解决但增加计算负担，因此需要一种高效的双向扫描方法。

Method: 提出LBMamba块，在正向选择性扫描中嵌入局部反向扫描，避免额外计算；基于此构建LBVim，交替扫描方向以恢复全局感知。

Result: LBVim在多个数据集上性能提升，如ImageNet-1K分类任务准确率提高0.8%-1.6%，病理图像分类AUC提升达3.06%。

Conclusion: LBMamba和LBVim在保持高效的同时显著提升性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting
recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a
linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its
unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous
states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision
methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward
scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a
full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load,
eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To
eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM
block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward
selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on
LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan
directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra
backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural
images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers
a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput,
LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K
classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic
segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection
dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance
learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan.
Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method
achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1,
1.67% better accuracy.

Motivation: 显微镜病理图像在癌症诊断中具有重要价值，但深度学习社区对其关注不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，提升显微镜图像分析的性能。

Method: 将显微镜图像序列视为时间序列数据，利用动态时间规整（DTW）处理变长序列，并通过注意力池化同时预测类别。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上优于多种基线，并通过消融研究验证了各组件的作用。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅将显微镜图像纳入深度学习分析范畴，还将其性能提升至可信水平。

Abstract: As the frontline data for cancer diagnosis, microscopic pathology images are
fundamental for providing patients with rapid and accurate treatment. However,
despite their practical value, the deep learning community has largely
overlooked their usage. This paper proposes a novel approach to classifying
microscopy images as time series data, addressing the unique challenges posed
by their manual acquisition and weakly labeled nature. The proposed method fits
image sequences of varying lengths to a fixed-length target by leveraging
Dynamic Time-series Warping (DTW). Attention-based pooling is employed to
predict the class of the case simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach by comparing performance with various baselines and showcasing
the benefits of using various inference strategies in achieving stable and
reliable results. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each
component. Our approach contributes to medical image analysis by not only
embracing microscopic images but also lifting them to a trustworthy level of
performance.

TL;DR: SignViP是一个新的手语视频生成框架，通过多细粒度条件提升生成质量，采用离散标记化和扩散模型实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一粗粒度条件（如骨架序列），限制了生成视频的自然性和表现力。

Method: SignViP包含三个核心组件：Sign Video Diffusion Model、FSQ Autoencoder和Multi-Condition Token Translator，通过离散标记化和多条件编码实现高效生成。

Result: 实验表明SignViP在视频质量、时间一致性和语义保真度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: SignViP通过多细粒度条件和离散标记化显著提升了手语视频生成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving
sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily
rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the
intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model,
which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos.
To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that
incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity.
Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions,
SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent
fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP
contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly
trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that
encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization
(FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings
into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3)
Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text
to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token
Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete
multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings
by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion
Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP
achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality,
temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at

Motivation: VPR系统在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，可能导致机器人导航灾难性后果，因此需要研究防御措施。

Method: 分析了四种常见对抗攻击和四种VPR特有攻击，提出结合AAD的闭环系统，并通过实验验证其性能提升。

Result: 实验表明，AAD能显著降低定位误差（如沿轨误差减少50%），并提供了多种性能指标分析。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AAD在真实系统中的必要性，为系统设计提供了量化要求。

Abstract: Stand-alone Visual Place Recognition (VPR) systems have little defence
against a well-designed adversarial attack, which can lead to disastrous
consequences when deployed for robot navigation. This paper extensively
analyzes the effect of four adversarial attacks common in other perception
tasks and four novel VPR-specific attacks on VPR localization performance. We
then propose how to close the loop between VPR, an Adversarial Attack Detector
(AAD), and active navigation decisions by demonstrating the performance benefit
of simulated AADs in a novel experiment paradigm -- which we detail for the
robotics community to use as a system framework. In the proposed experiment
paradigm, we see the addition of AADs across a range of detection accuracies
can improve performance over baseline; demonstrating a significant improvement
-- such as a ~50% reduction in the mean along-track localization error -- can
be achieved with True Positive and False Positive detection rates of only 75%
and up to 25% respectively. We examine a variety of metrics including:
Along-Track Error, Percentage of Time Attacked, Percentage of Time in an
`Unsafe' State, and Longest Continuous Time Under Attack. Expanding further on
these results, we provide the first investigation into the efficacy of the Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) adversarial attack for VPR. The analysis in this
work highlights the need for AADs in real-world systems for trustworthy
navigation, and informs quantitative requirements for system design.

Abstract: Historical geologic maps contain rich geospatial information, such as rock
units, faults, folds, and bedding planes, that is critical for assessing
mineral resources essential to renewable energy, electric vehicles, and
national security. However, digitizing maps remains a labor-intensive and
time-consuming task. We present DIGMAPPER, a modular, scalable system developed
in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to automate
the digitization of geologic maps. DIGMAPPER features a fully dockerized,
workflow-orchestrated architecture that integrates state-of-the-art deep
learning models for map layout analysis, feature extraction, and
georeferencing. To overcome challenges such as limited training data and
complex visual content, our system employs innovative techniques, including
in-context learning with large language models, synthetic data generation, and
transformer-based models. Evaluations on over 100 annotated maps from the
DARPA-USGS dataset demonstrate high accuracy across polygon, line, and point
feature extraction, and reliable georeferencing performance. Deployed at USGS,
DIGMAPPER significantly accelerates the creation of analysis-ready geospatial
datasets, supporting national-scale critical mineral assessments and broader
geoscientific applications.

Motivation: 内窥镜场景中的光照变化和稀疏纹理对深度估计和运动估计提出了挑战，现有方法需要更有效的训练策略。

Method: 提出了一种多步高效微调框架，包括光流注册、多尺度图像分解和多重变换对齐三个步骤，每个步骤仅训练相关网络。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上实现了自监督深度估计的最佳性能，在Hamlyn数据集上实现了零样本深度估计，误差降低了4%~10%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多步微调策略有效解决了内窥镜场景中的光照和信息干扰问题，显著提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation and ego-motion estimation are significant tasks
for scene perception and navigation in stable, accurate and efficient
robot-assisted endoscopy. To tackle lighting variations and sparse textures in
endoscopic scenes, multiple techniques including optical flow, appearance flow
and intrinsic image decomposition have been introduced into the existing
methods. However, the effective training strategy for multiple modules are
still critical to deal with both illumination issues and information
interference for self-supervised depth estimation in endoscopy. Therefore, a
novel framework with multistep efficient finetuning is proposed in this work.
In each epoch of end-to-end training, the process is divided into three steps,
including optical flow registration, multiscale image decomposition and
multiple transformation alignments. At each step, only the related networks are
trained without interference of irrelevant information. Based on
parameter-efficient finetuning on the foundation model, the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised depth estimation on
SCARED dataset and zero-shot depth estimation on Hamlyn dataset, with
4\%$\sim$10\% lower error. The evaluation code of this work has been published

Conclusion: PAROAttention通过重新组织注意力模式，显著降低了计算和内存成本，同时保持了视觉生成的高质量。

Abstract: In visual generation, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms
results in high memory and computational costs, especially for longer token
sequences required in high-resolution image or multi-frame video generation. To
address this, prior research has explored techniques such as sparsification and
quantization. However, these techniques face significant challenges under low
density and reduced bitwidths. Through systematic analysis, we identify that
the core difficulty stems from the dispersed and irregular characteristics of
visual attention patterns. Therefore, instead of introducing specialized
sparsification and quantization design to accommodate such patterns, we propose
an alternative strategy: *reorganizing* the attention pattern to alleviate the
challenges. Inspired by the local aggregation nature of visual feature
extraction, we design a novel **Pattern-Aware token ReOrdering (PARO)**
technique, which unifies the diverse attention patterns into a
hardware-friendly block-wise pattern. This unification substantially simplifies
and enhances both sparsification and quantization. We evaluate the
performance-efficiency trade-offs of various design choices and finalize a
methodology tailored for the unified pattern. Our approach, **PAROAttention**,
achieves video and image generation with lossless metrics, and nearly identical
results from full-precision (FP) baselines, while operating at notably lower
density (~20%-30%) and bitwidth (**INT8/INT4**), achieving a **1.9x** to
**2.7x** end-to-end latency speedup.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation aims to achieve segmentation of arbitrary
categories given unlimited text inputs as guidance. To achieve this, recent
works have focused on developing various technical routes to exploit the
potential of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models and have made
significant progress on existing benchmarks. However, we find that existing
test sets are limited in measuring the models' comprehension of
``open-vocabulary" concepts, as their semantic space closely resembles the
training space, even with many overlapping categories. To this end, we present
a new benchmark named OpenBench that differs significantly from the training
semantics. It is designed to better assess the model's ability to understand
and segment a wide range of real-world concepts. When testing existing methods
on OpenBench, we find that their performance diverges from the conclusions
drawn on existing test sets. In addition, we propose a method named OVSNet to
improve the segmentation performance for diverse and open scenarios. Through
elaborate fusion of heterogeneous features and cost-free expansion of the
training space, OVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results on both existing
datasets and our proposed OpenBench. Corresponding analysis demonstrate the
soundness and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark and method.

Conclusion: STAR-Pose在低分辨率视频中实现了高效且准确的人体姿态估计，为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Human pose estimation in low-resolution videos presents a fundamental
challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods either assume high-quality
inputs or employ computationally expensive cascaded processing, which limits
their deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose STAR-Pose, a
spatial-temporal adaptive super-resolution framework specifically designed for
video-based human pose estimation. Our method features a novel spatial-temporal
Transformer with LeakyReLU-modified linear attention, which efficiently
captures long-range temporal dependencies. Moreover, it is complemented by an
adaptive fusion module that integrates parallel CNN branch for local texture
enhancement. We also design a pose-aware compound loss to achieve task-oriented
super-resolution. This loss guides the network to reconstruct structural
features that are most beneficial for keypoint localization, rather than
optimizing purely for visual quality. Extensive experiments on several
mainstream video HPE datasets demonstrate that STAR-Pose outperforms existing
approaches. It achieves up to 5.2% mAP improvement under extremely
low-resolution (64x48) conditions while delivering 2.8x to 4.4x faster
inference than cascaded approaches.

Result: 在LRW和LRW-1000数据集上表现优异，参数和计算量更少。

Conclusion: TD3Net有效利用多样化时间特征，保持时间连续性，显著提升唇读系统性能。

Abstract: The word-level lipreading approach typically employs a two-stage framework
with separate frontend and backend architectures to model dynamic lip
movements. Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend
architecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted
in state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been
introduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,
thereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,
their performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss
regarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the
receptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal
densely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip
connections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend
architecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind
spots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.
Experimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly
available datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that
the proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods. It achieved higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower
floating-point operations compared to existing TCN-based backend architectures.
Moreover, visualization results suggest that our approach effectively utilizes
diverse temporal features while preserving temporal continuity, presenting
notable advantages in lipreading systems. The code is available at our GitHub

Conclusion: 显式先验显著提升密集视频描述任务的性能。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging task that aims to localize and
caption multiple events in an untrimmed video. Recent studies mainly follow the
transformer-based architecture to jointly perform the two sub-tasks, i.e.,
event localization and caption generation, in an end-to-end manner. Based on
the general philosophy of detection transformer, these methods implicitly learn
the event locations and event semantics, which requires a large amount of
training data and limits the model's performance in practice. In this paper, we
propose a novel dense video captioning framework, named PR-DETR, which injects
the explicit position and relation prior into the detection transformer to
improve the localization accuracy and caption quality, simultaneously. On the
one hand, we first generate a set of position-anchored queries to provide the
scene-specific position and semantic information about potential events as
position prior, which serves as the initial event search regions to eliminate
the implausible event proposals. On the other hand, we further design an event
relation encoder to explicitly calculate the relationship between event
boundaries as relation prior to guide the event interaction to improve the
semantic coherence of the captions. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to
verify the effectiveness of the position and relation prior. Experimental
results also show the competitive performance of our method on ActivityNet
Captions and YouCook2 datasets.

Conclusion: AutoV是一种高效的视觉提示优化方法，为LVLM性能提升提供新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by text prompts in large language models (LLMs), visual prompts have
been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). Current methods design heuristic visual prompts, such as
overlaying a text-query-guided attention heatmap on the original input image.
However, designing effective prompts manually is challenging and
time-consuming, and it often fails to explore the benefits of different visual
prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose
\textbf{AutoV} that learns to automatically select the optimal visual prompt
from various candidates based on given textual queries and the input image. To
train AutoV, we developed an automatic data collection and labeling pipeline
that evaluates various visual prompts with a pre-trained LVLM. We input a set
of visual prompts into the LVLM and rank them according to the prediction
losses generated by the model. Using the ranking as a supervision signal, we
train AutoV to automatically choose the optimal visual prompt from various
visual prompts for LVLMs. Experimental results indicate that AutoV enhances the
performance of various LVLMs across multiple popular image understanding tasks.
For instance, LLaVA-OV with AutoV achieves $\textbf{1.7}\%$ accuracy gain on
LLaVA$^{\text{Wild}}$, and AutoV boosts Qwen2.5-VL by $\textbf{1.9}\%$ on MMMU,
highlighting its potential as an optimal visual prompting method for LVLMs.

*Chengyu Bai,Yuming Li,Zhongyu Zhao,Jintao Chen,Peidong Jia,Qi She,Ming Lu,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastInit是一种快速噪声初始化方法，通过单次前向传播生成优化噪声，显著提升视频生成效率并保持高时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）通过迭代优化噪声提高时间一致性，但计算成本高。FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet)，利用大规模数据集（文本提示、随机噪声和优化噪声对）训练，单次生成优化噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提升视频生成质量和时间一致性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供高效实用解决方案，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeepObjectLog的神经符号模型，直接从原始非结构化感知数据中学习对象中心表示，仅需远程监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统依赖对象级监督或预定义的输入分解，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 结合感知模块提取对象表示和基于概率逻辑编程的符号推理层，通过概率逻辑推理引入学习信号。

Result: 在多种泛化场景中表现优于神经和神经符号基线。

Conclusion: DeepObjectLog展示了从非结构化数据中学习对象中心表示的有效性。

Abstract: Relational learning enables models to generalize across structured domains by
reasoning over objects and their interactions. While recent advances in
neurosymbolic reasoning and object-centric learning bring us closer to this
goal, existing systems rely either on object-level supervision or on a
predefined decomposition of the input into objects. In this work, we propose a
neurosymbolic formulation for learning object-centric representations directly
from raw unstructured perceptual data and using only distant supervision. We
instantiate this approach in DeepObjectLog, a neurosymbolic model that
integrates a perceptual module, which extracts relevant object representations,
with a symbolic reasoning layer based on probabilistic logic programming. By
enabling sound probabilistic logical inference, the symbolic component
introduces a novel learning signal that further guides the discovery of
meaningful objects in the input. We evaluate our model across a diverse range
of generalization settings, including unseen object compositions, unseen tasks,
and unseen number of objects. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms neural and neurosymbolic baselines across the tested settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GRPO-CARE框架，通过双奖励机制提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理一致性和答案准确性，并在SEED-Bench-R1基准上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）在MLLMs中缺乏严格的评估，且存在推理步骤与答案逻辑不一致的问题。

Method: GRPO-CARE引入双奖励机制：基础奖励（答案正确性）和自适应一致性奖励（推理与答案的逻辑一致性）。

Result: GRPO-CARE在SEED-Bench-R1上表现优于标准GRPO，性能提升6.7%，一致性提高24.5%。

Conclusion: GRPO-CARE为MLLMs提供了一种可推广的后训练框架，提升了模型的解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning approaches, such as outcome-supervised GRPO,
have advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
their adaptation to multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) is unexplored. To address the lack
of rigorous evaluation for MLLM post-training methods, we introduce
SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark with complex real-world videos requiring balanced
perception and reasoning. It offers a large training set and evaluates
generalization across three escalating challenges: in-distribution,
cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. Using SEED-Bench-R1,
we find that standard GRPO, while improving answer accuracy, often reduces
logical coherence between reasoning steps and answers, with only a 57.9%
consistency rate. This stems from reward signals focusing solely on final
answers, encouraging shortcuts, and strict KL penalties limiting exploration.To
address this, we propose GRPO-CARE, a consistency-aware RL framework optimizing
both answer correctness and reasoning coherence without explicit supervision.
GRPO-CARE introduces a two-tiered reward: (1) a base reward for answer
correctness, and (2) an adaptive consistency bonus, computed by comparing the
model's reasoning-to-answer likelihood (via a slowly-evolving reference model)
against group peers.This dual mechanism amplifies rewards for reasoning paths
that are both correct and logically consistent. Replacing KL penalties with
this adaptive bonus, GRPO-CARE outperforms standard GRPO on SEED-Bench-R1,
achieving a 6.7% performance gain on the hardest evaluation level and a 24.5%
improvement in consistency. It also shows strong transferability, improving
model performance across diverse video understanding benchmarks. Our work
contributes a systematically designed benchmark and a generalizable
post-training framework, advancing the development of more interpretable and
robust MLLMs.

Result: 在多个RES模型和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了RES模型对抗样本的跨文本迁移能力，填补了多模态对抗攻击的研究空白。

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation
in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and
broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive
performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains
largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored
adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly
when directly applied to RES, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its
multimodal structure. Moreover, in practical open-world scenarios, users
typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the
same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize
across varied textual inputs. To address these multimodal challenges, we
propose a novel adversarial attack strategy termed \textbf{Multimodal
Bidirectional Attack}, tailored for RES models. Our method introduces learnable
proxy textual embedding perturbation and jointly performs visual-aligned
optimization on the image modality and textual-adversarial optimization on the
textual modality during attack generation. This dual optimization framework
encourages adversarial images to actively adapt to more challenging text
embedding during optimization, thereby enhancing their cross-text
transferability, which refers to the ability of adversarial examples to remain
effective under a variety of unseen or semantically diverse textual inputs.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple RES models and benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our method compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: GAP框架通过先验知识和模块化设计，成功实现了泛化与个性化的统一，为远程生理测量提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-source synsemantic domain generalization (MSSDG) for multi-task remote
physiological measurement seeks to enhance the generalizability of these
metrics and attracts increasing attention. However, challenges like partial
labeling and environmental noise may disrupt task-specific accuracy. Meanwhile,
given that real-time adaptation is necessary for personalized products, the
test-time personalized adaptation (TTPA) after MSSDG is also worth exploring,
while the gap between previous generalization and personalization methods is
significant and hard to fuse. Thus, we proposed a unified framework for
MSSD\textbf{G} and TTP\textbf{A} employing \textbf{P}riors (\textbf{GAP}) in
biometrics and remote photoplethysmography (rPPG). We first disentangled
information from face videos into invariant semantics, individual bias, and
noise. Then, multiple modules incorporating priors and our observations were
applied in different stages and for different facial information. Then, based
on the different principles of achieving generalization and personalization,
our framework could simultaneously address MSSDG and TTPA under multi-task
remote physiological estimation with minimal adjustments. We expanded the MSSDG
benchmark to the TTPA protocol on six publicly available datasets and
introduced a new real-world driving dataset with complete labeling. Extensive
experiments that validated our approach, and the codes along with the new
dataset will be released.

Abstract: Accident detection using Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage is one of
the most imperative features for enhancing transport safety and efficient
traffic control. To this end, this research addresses the issues of supervised
monitoring and data deficiency in accident detection systems by adapting
excellent deep learning technologies. The motivation arises from rising
statistics in the number of car accidents worldwide; this calls for innovation
and the establishment of a smart, efficient and automated way of identifying
accidents and calling for help to save lives. Addressing the problem of the
scarcity of data, the presented framework joins Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) for synthesizing data and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for model
training. Video frames for accidents and non-accidents are collected from
YouTube videos, and we perform resizing, image enhancement and image
normalisation pixel range adjustments. Three models are used: CNN, Fine-tuned
Convolutional Neural Network (FTCNN) and Vision Transformer (VIT) worked best
for detecting accidents from CCTV, obtaining an accuracy rate of 94% and 95%,
while the CNN model obtained 88%. Such results show that the proposed framework
suits traffic safety applications due to its high real-time accident detection
capabilities and broad-scale applicability. This work lays the foundation for
intelligent surveillance systems in the future for real-time traffic
monitoring, smart city framework, and integration of intelligent surveillance

Abstract: Being able to generate realistic trajectory options is at the core of
increasing the degree of automation of road vehicles. While model-driven,
rule-based, and classical learning-based methods are widely used to tackle
these tasks at present, they can struggle to effectively capture the complex,
multimodal distributions of future trajectories. In this paper we investigate
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on videos of bird's-eye
view (BEV) traffic scenarios can generate statistically accurate trajectories
that correctly capture spatial relationships between the agents. To this end,
we propose a pipeline that uses low-resolution BEV occupancy grid videos as
training data for a video generative model. From the generated videos of
traffic scenarios we extract abstract trajectory data using single-frame object
detection and frame-to-frame object matching. We particularly choose a GAN
architecture for the fast training and inference times with respect to
diffusion models. We obtain our best results within 100 GPU hours of training,
with inference times under 20\,ms. We demonstrate the physical realism of the
proposed trajectories in terms of distribution alignment of spatial and dynamic
parameters with respect to the ground truth videos from the Waymo Open Motion
Dataset.

Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法在性能与鲁棒性之间存在权衡，尤其在OOD偏移下表现不佳，数据异构性加剧了这一挑战。

Method: FOCoOp利用三类提示（全局、局部、OOD）实现类别和分布级分离，并通过双层分布鲁棒优化适应OOD偏移，同时使用半不平衡最优传输校准提示。

Result: 实验表明FOCoOp能有效捕捉分布式异构数据并增强OOD偏移下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FOCoOp填补了联邦提示学习在OOD场景下的空白，提升了模型的可靠性和适应性。

Abstract: Federated prompt learning (FPL) for vision-language models is a powerful
approach to collaboratively adapt models across distributed clients while
preserving data privacy. However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a
trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world
scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different
clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap,
we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework,
which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts,
local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of
prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which
adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients,
i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by
semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized
heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）依赖高质量输入，但在实际场景中常遇到噪声、模糊、低分辨率等问题，限制了其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将2D低层视觉任务（如超分辨率、去模糊）扩展到3D空间，结合神经渲染框架，解决退化感知渲染问题。

Conclusion: 3D LLV是提升真实场景中3D内容生成和重建鲁棒性的重要方向，尤其在自动驾驶、AR/VR等领域有广泛应用。

Abstract: Neural rendering methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved significant progress in photorealistic
3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing models
assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their
robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution
(LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging
field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision
tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal,
restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred
to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust
rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the
degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to
spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that
integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate
how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions.
Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also
discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By
reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work
positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation
and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于TLS的滑坡监测提供了实用且适应性强的解决方案，并可扩展至其他点云和监测任务。

Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating
associated risks. However, existing point cloud-based methods typically rely on
either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D
displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical
partition-based coarse-to-fine approach that fuses 3D point clouds and
co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. We
construct patch-level matches using both 3D geometry and 2D image features.
These matches are refined via geometric consistency checks, followed by rigid
transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world
landslide datasets demonstrate that our method produces 3D displacement
estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and high accuracy.
Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements
(total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets,
respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived
references. These values are below the average scan resolutions (0.08 m and
0.30 m). Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method F2S3 in spatial
coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach offers a practical
and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to
other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. Our example data and source
code are publicly available at https://github.com/zhaoyiww/fusion4landslide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FGIR方法容易过拟合训练数据，忽略预训练知识，导致泛化能力下降。

Method: DVA包括对象感知适应（修改输入样本）和上下文适应（调整特征参数），并通过知识蒸馏平衡检索效率与性能。

Result: DVA在多个数据集上表现优异，且参数较少。

Conclusion: DVA有效提升了FGIR的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Image Retrieval~(FGIR) faces challenges in learning
discriminative visual representations to retrieve images with similar
fine-grained features. Current leading FGIR solutions typically follow two
regimes: enforce pairwise similarity constraints in the semantic embedding
space, or incorporate a localization sub-network to fine-tune the entire model.
However, such two regimes tend to overfit the training data while forgetting
the knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training, thus reducing their
generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Vision Adaptation
(DVA) approach for FGIR, which guides the frozen pre-trained model to perform
FGIR through collaborative sample and feature adaptation. Specifically, we
design Object-Perceptual Adaptation, which modifies input samples to help the
pre-trained model perceive critical objects and elements within objects that
are helpful for category prediction. Meanwhile, we propose In-Context
Adaptation, which introduces a small set of parameters for feature adaptation
without modifying the pre-trained parameters. This makes the FGIR task using
these adjusted features closer to the task solved during the pre-training.
Additionally, to balance retrieval efficiency and performance, we propose
Discrimination Perception Transfer to transfer the discriminative knowledge in
the object-perceptual adaptation to the image encoder using the knowledge
distillation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that DVA has fewer learnable
parameters and performs well on three in-distribution and three
out-of-distribution fine-grained datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉在无监督条件下仍能保持鲁棒性，而现有AI算法在类似条件下表现不佳，因此需要开发更鲁棒的无监督分割方法。

Method: SyncMapV2结合自组织动力学方程和随机网络概念，无需鲁棒训练或监督即可实现分割。

Result: 在数字干扰下，SyncMapV2的mIoU仅下降0.01%，远优于现有方法的23.8%下降。在噪声、天气和模糊等干扰下也表现优异。

Conclusion: SyncMapV2首次实现了在线适应性，为未来鲁棒和自适应智能算法的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human vision excels at segmenting visual cues without the need for explicit
training, and it remains remarkably robust even as noise severity increases. In
contrast, existing AI algorithms struggle to maintain accuracy under similar
conditions. Here, we present SyncMapV2, the first to solve unsupervised
segmentation with state-of-the-art robustness. SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal
drop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop
observed in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types
of corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%
vs. 29.5%). Notably, SyncMapV2 accomplishes this without any robust training,
supervision, or loss functions. It is based on a learning paradigm that uses
self-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random
networks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization
for each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous
adaptability of human vision. Thus, we go beyond the accurate and robust
results, and present the first algorithm that can do all the above online,
adapting to input rather than re-initializing. In adaptability tests, SyncMapV2
demonstrates near-zero performance degradation, which motivates and fosters a
new generation of robust and adaptive intelligence in the near future.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声图像数据集上验证了MADNet的优越性。

Conclusion: MADNet在多尺度表示和频率域处理上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-scale architectures have demonstrated
exceptional performance in image denoising tasks. However, existing
architectures mainly depends on a fixed single-input single-output Unet
architecture, ignoring the multi-scale representations of pixel level. In
addition, previous methods treat the frequency domain uniformly, ignoring the
different characteristics of high-frequency and low-frequency noise. In this
paper, we propose a novel multi-scale adaptive dual-domain network (MADNet) for
image denoising. We use image pyramid inputs to restore noise-free results from
low-resolution images. In order to realize the interaction of high-frequency
and low-frequency information, we design an adaptive spatial-frequency learning
unit (ASFU), where a learnable mask is used to separate the information into
high-frequency and low-frequency components. In the skip connections, we design
a global feature fusion block to enhance the features at different scales.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real noisy image datasets verify
the effectiveness of MADNet compared with current state-of-the-art denoising
approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of agricultural field boundaries is essential for the
efficient operation of agriculture. Automatic extraction from high-resolution
satellite imagery, supported by computer vision techniques, can avoid costly
ground surveys. In this paper, we present a pipeline for field delineation
based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), introducing a fine-tuning strategy
to adapt SAM to this task. In addition to using published datasets, we describe
a method for acquiring a complementary regional dataset that covers areas
beyond current sources. Extensive experiments assess segmentation accuracy and
evaluate the generalization capabilities. Our approach provides a robust
baseline for automated field delineation. The new regional dataset, known as
ERAS, is now publicly available.

Abstract: As perception models continue to develop, the need for large-scale datasets
increases. However, data annotation remains far too expensive to effectively
scale and meet the demand. Synthetic datasets provide a solution to boost model
performance with substantially reduced costs. However, current synthetic
datasets remain limited in their scope, realism, and are designed for specific
tasks and applications. In this work, we present RealDriveSim, a realistic
multi-modal synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that not only supports
popular 2D computer vision applications but also their LiDAR counterparts,
providing fine-grained annotations for up to 64 classes. We extensively
evaluate our dataset for a wide range of applications and domains,
demonstrating state-of-the-art results compared to existing synthetic
benchmarks. The dataset is publicly available at

TL;DR: DETA++提出了一种去噪任务适应方法，通过对比相关性聚合和局部最近质心分类器，有效应对少样本学习中的分布内外噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在开放世界中可能因支持样本和查询样本中的分布内外噪声而失效，尤其在少样本情况下，噪声影响会被放大。

Method: DETA++使用对比相关性聚合模块计算支持样本的权重，提出干净原型损失和噪声熵最大化损失，并利用内存库存储干净区域，设计局部最近质心分类器。

Result: 实验表明DETA++在噪声环境下表现优异，具有较高的鲁棒性和灵活性。

Conclusion: DETA++通过去噪和原型修正策略，显著提升了少样本学习在噪声环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in model pre-training give rise to task adaptation-based
few-shot learning (FSL), where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic
model for capturing task-specific knowledge with a few-labeled support samples
of the target task.Nevertheless, existing approaches may still fail in the open
world due to the inevitable in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)
noise from both support and query samples of the target task. With limited
support samples available, i) the adverse effect of the dual noises can be
severely amplified during task adaptation, and ii) the adapted model can
produce unreliable predictions on query samples in the presence of the dual
noises. In this work, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA++) for reliable
FSL. DETA++ uses a Contrastive Relevance Aggregation (CoRA) module to calculate
image and region weights for support samples, based on which a clean prototype
loss and a noise entropy maximization loss are proposed to achieve noise-robust
task adaptation. Additionally,DETA++ employs a memory bank to store and refine
clean regions for each inner-task class, based on which a Local Nearest
Centroid Classifier (LocalNCC) is devised to yield noise-robust predictions on
query samples. Moreover, DETA++ utilizes an Intra-class Region Swapping
(IntraSwap) strategy to rectify ID class prototypes during task adaptation,
enhancing the model's robustness to the dual noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of DETA++.

Result: 像素级显著性图表现更优，适合支持法医专家工作。

Conclusion: 像素级显著性图在笔迹识别和验证中具有实用价值，能为法医专家提供有效信息。

Abstract: Neural Networks are the state of the art for many tasks in the computer
vision domain, including Writer Identification (WI) and Writer Verification
(WV). The transparency of these "black box" systems is important for
improvements of performance and reliability. For this work, two transparency
techniques are applied to neural networks trained on WI and WV for the first
time in this domain. The first technique provides pixel-level saliency maps,
while the point-specific saliency maps of the second technique provide
information on similarities between two images. The transparency techniques are
evaluated using deletion and insertion score metrics. The goal is to support
forensic experts with information on similarities in handwritten text and to
explore the characteristics selected by a neural network for the identification
process. For the qualitative evaluation, the highlights of the maps are
compared to the areas forensic experts consider during the identification
process. The evaluation results show that the pixel-wise saliency maps
outperform the point-specific saliency maps and are suitable for the support of
forensic experts.

Conclusion: MambaHash是一种高效且性能优越的大规模图像检索方法。

Abstract: Deep image hashing aims to enable effective large-scale image retrieval by
mapping the input images into simple binary hash codes through deep neural
networks. More recently, Vision Mamba with linear time complexity has attracted
extensive attention from researchers by achieving outstanding performance on
various computer tasks. Nevertheless, the suitability of Mamba for large-scale
image retrieval tasks still needs to be explored. Towards this end, we propose
a visual state space hashing model, called MambaHash. Concretely, we propose a
backbone network with stage-wise architecture, in which grouped Mamba operation
is introduced to model local and global information by utilizing Mamba to
perform multi-directional scanning along different groups of the channel.
Subsequently, the proposed channel interaction attention module is used to
enhance information communication across channels. Finally, we meticulously
design an adaptive feature enhancement module to increase feature diversity and
enhance the visual representation capability of the model. We have conducted
comprehensive experiments on three widely used datasets: CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and
IMAGENET. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the
state-of-the-art deep hashing methods, our proposed MambaHash has well
efficiency and superior performance to effectively accomplish large-scale image
retrieval tasks. Source code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于提示的自适应剪枝方法，减少ViTs在医学图像分割中的计算负担，提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 在处理大量标记时计算需求高，限制了其在医学图像分析中的实际应用。

Method: 采用提示引导的自适应剪枝方法，通过空间先验对标记进行相关性排序，低相关性标记被降权，仅处理高相关性标记。

Result: 实验显示标记数量减少35-55%，计算成本降低，同时保持分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了计算效率，适用于资源受限环境，促进实时诊断。

Abstract: The high computational demands of Vision Transformers (ViTs), in processing a
huge number of tokens, often constrain their practical application in analyzing
medical images. This research proposes an adaptive prompt-guided pruning method
to selectively reduce the processing of irrelevant tokens in the segmentation
pipeline. The prompt-based spatial prior helps to rank the tokens according to
their relevance. Tokens with low-relevance scores are down-weighted, ensuring
that only the relevant ones are propagated for processing across subsequent
stages. This data-driven pruning strategy facilitates end-to-end training,
maintains gradient flow, and improves segmentation accuracy by focusing
computational resources on essential regions. The proposed framework is
integrated with several state-of-the-art models to facilitate the elimination
of irrelevant tokens; thereby, enhancing computational efficiency while
preserving segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show a reduction of
$\sim$ 35-55\% tokens; thus reducing the computational costs relative to the
baselines. Cost-effective medical image processing, using our framework,
facilitates real-time diagnosis by expanding its applicability in
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注车辆间或车辆与基础设施的协作，忽视了无人机提供的动态俯视视角，且缺乏高质量数据集。

Method: 通过两辆装备多摄像头和LiDAR的车辆及一架无人机收集数据，覆盖14种驾驶场景，包含12万LiDAR帧和44万图像。

Result: 数据集包含400个场景，13类物体的3D标注，并提供了两种3D感知任务的基准。

Conclusion: AGC-Drive填补了空中-地面协作感知数据集的空白，并提供了开源工具包。

Abstract: By sharing information across multiple agents, collaborative perception helps
autonomous vehicles mitigate occlusions and improve overall perception
accuracy. While most previous work focus on vehicle-to-vehicle and
vehicle-to-infrastructure collaboration, with limited attention to aerial
perspectives provided by UAVs, which uniquely offer dynamic, top-down views to
alleviate occlusions and monitor large-scale interactive environments. A major
reason for this is the lack of high-quality datasets for aerial-ground
collaborative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present AGC-Drive, the first
large-scale real-world dataset for Aerial-Ground Cooperative 3D perception. The
data collection platform consists of two vehicles, each equipped with five
cameras and one LiDAR sensor, and one UAV carrying a forward-facing camera and
a LiDAR sensor, enabling comprehensive multi-view and multi-agent perception.
Consisting of approximately 120K LiDAR frames and 440K images, the dataset
covers 14 diverse real-world driving scenarios, including urban roundabouts,
highway tunnels, and on/off ramps. Notably, 19.5% of the data comprises dynamic
interaction events, including vehicle cut-ins, cut-outs, and frequent lane
changes. AGC-Drive contains 400 scenes, each with approximately 100 frames and
fully annotated 3D bounding boxes covering 13 object categories. We provide
benchmarks for two 3D perception tasks: vehicle-to-vehicle collaborative
perception and vehicle-to-UAV collaborative perception. Additionally, we
release an open-source toolkit, including spatiotemporal alignment verification
tools, multi-agent visualization systems, and collaborative annotation
utilities. The dataset and code are available at

Motivation: 微手势因其细微性和不自主性，识别难度大，需改进现有方法。

Method: 结合姿态信息，改进CLIP模型，引入姿态引导语义查询和多模态融合机制。

Result: Top-1准确率为61.82%，显示模型潜力但仍存挑战。

Conclusion: CLIP-MG展示了将视觉语言模型应用于微手势识别的潜力，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition is a challenging task in affective computing due to
the subtle, involuntary nature of the gestures and their low movement
amplitude. In this paper, we introduce a Pose-Guided Semantics-Aware CLIP-based
architecture, or CLIP for Micro-Gesture recognition (CLIP-MG), a modified CLIP
model tailored for micro-gesture classification on the iMiGUE dataset. CLIP-MG
integrates human pose (skeleton) information into the CLIP-based recognition
pipeline through pose-guided semantic query generation and a gated multi-modal
fusion mechanism. The proposed model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 61.82%. These
results demonstrate both the potential of our approach and the remaining
difficulty in fully adapting vision-language models like CLIP for micro-gesture
recognition.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖欧几里得嵌入，难以充分捕捉WSI的语义层次结构，因此提出双曲空间建模以改进。

Method: 结合病理视觉语言基础模型提取的特征，设计角度模态对齐损失和语义层次一致性损失，利用测地距离进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，HyperPath在多项任务中优于现有方法，验证了双曲嵌入在WSI分析中的潜力。

Conclusion: 双曲空间建模能有效提升WSI分类性能，为病理图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning
(MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural
hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic
associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for
improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which
struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we
propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual
descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in
hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts
both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language
foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality
Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic
Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through
entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence.
The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the
similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This
eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware
approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting
the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.

Method: 提出统一框架，结合OCR边界框、像素和文本的操纵，设计六种布局攻击场景，并约束布局扰动预算以保持合理性。

Result: 实验表明，行级攻击和复合扰动（BBox + Pixel + Text）导致性能下降最严重，PGD-based BBox扰动优于随机基线。

Conclusion: 研究验证了布局预算、文本修改和对抗迁移性的影响，为VDU模型的鲁棒性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding (VDU) systems have achieved strong performance
in information extraction by integrating textual, layout, and visual signals.
However, their robustness under realistic adversarial perturbations remains
insufficiently explored. We introduce the first unified framework for
generating and evaluating multi-modal adversarial attacks on OCR-based VDU
models. Our method covers six gradient-based layout attack scenarios,
incorporating manipulations of OCR bounding boxes, pixels, and texts across
both word and line granularities, with constraints on layout perturbation
budget (e.g., IoU >= 0.6) to preserve plausibility.
  Experimental results across four datasets (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA) and
six model families demonstrate that line-level attacks and compound
perturbations (BBox + Pixel + Text) yield the most severe performance
degradation. Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)-based BBox perturbations
outperform random-shift baselines in all investigated models. Ablation studies
further validate the impact of layout budget, text modification, and
adversarial transferability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of signal processing transformations
-- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT), and Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT) -- within the ResNet50 convolutional neural network

trade-offs between computational efficiency, energy consumption, and

dataset (100 classes, 60,000 images), experiments demonstrated that
incorporating WHT significantly reduced energy consumption while improving
accuracy. Specifically, a baseline ResNet50 model achieved a testing accuracy
of 66%, consuming an average of 25,606 kJ per model. In contrast, a modified
ResNet50 incorporating WHT in the early convolutional layers achieved 74%
accuracy, and an enhanced version with WHT applied to both early and late

per model. These results demonstrate the potential of WHT as a highly efficient

Abstract: Face swapping manipulations in video streams represents an increasing threat
in remote video communications, due to advances
  in automated and real-time tools. Recent literature proposes to characterize
and exploit visual artifacts introduced in video frames

face occlusions. This paper investigates the
  effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking CNN-based data-driven models
on two data corpora (including a newly collected
  one) and analyzing generalization capabilities with respect to different
acquisition sources and swapping algorithms. The results
  confirm excellent performance of general-purpose CNN architectures when
operating within the same data source, but a significant
  difficulty in robustly characterizing occlusion-based visual cues across
datasets. This highlights the need for specialized detection
  strategies to deal with such artifacts.

Motivation: 当前数据集在雪天和晴天的标注数据不足，或依赖去雪方法生成合成数据，缺乏真实性。CADC+旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展CADC数据集，配对雪天和晴天的数据，确保环境一致，减少无关因素的域偏移。

Result: 初步结果显示，雪既引入噪声，也形成独特的数据域，导致目标检测性能的不确定性。

Conclusion: CADC+为研究雪对3D目标检测的影响提供了更真实的数据基础。

Abstract: The impact of snowfall on 3D object detection performance remains
underexplored. Conducting such an evaluation requires a dataset with sufficient
labelled data from both weather conditions, ideally captured in the same
driving environment. Current driving datasets with LiDAR point clouds either do
not provide enough labelled data in both snowy and clear weather conditions, or
rely on de-snowing methods to generate synthetic clear weather. Synthetic data
often lacks realism and introduces an additional domain shift that confounds
accurate evaluations. To address these challenges, we present CADC+, the first
paired weather domain adaptation dataset for autonomous driving in winter
conditions. CADC+ extends the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions dataset
(CADC) using clear weather data that was recorded on the same roads and in the
same period as CADC. To create CADC+, we pair each CADC sequence with a clear
weather sequence that matches the snowy sequence as closely as possible. CADC+
thus minimizes the domain shift resulting from factors unrelated to the
presence of snow. We also present some preliminary results using CADC+ to
evaluate the effect of snow on 3D object detection performance. We observe that
snow introduces a combination of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acting
as both noise and a distinct data domain.

Conclusion: GLMask方法高效且通用，适用于农业及其他类似数据特征的领域。

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for applications such as automated
monitoring of plant health, growth, and yield. However, extensive effort is
required to create large-scale datasets with pixel-level annotations of each
object instance for developing instance segmentation models that restrict the
use of deep learning in these areas. This challenge is more significant in
images with densely packed, self-occluded objects, which are common in
agriculture. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-self-supervised
learning approach that requires minimal manual annotation to develop a
high-performing instance segmentation model. We design GLMask, an image-mask
representation for the model to focus on shape, texture, and pattern while
minimizing its dependence on color features. We develop a pipeline to generate
semantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.
The proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance
segmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance
segmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed
methodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a
significant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that
the utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and
applies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics.

TL;DR: SafeTriage是一种新方法，通过去识别化患者面部视频保留关键运动特征，解决AI模型依赖真实患者数据的伦理和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在急诊环境中，依赖真实患者数据的AI模型面临伦理和隐私挑战，尤其是跨机构训练时。

Method: SafeTriage利用预训练的视频运动转移模型，将真实患者面部的运动特征映射到合成身份上，并通过条件生成模型调整输入空间。

Result: 合成视频有效保留了中风相关的面部模式，同时提供强大的隐私保护，保持了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: SafeTriage为神经疾病数据共享和AI临床分析提供了安全且伦理的基础。

Abstract: Effective stroke triage in emergency settings often relies on clinicians'
ability to identify subtle abnormalities in facial muscle coordination. While
recent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient
facial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical
and privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable
models across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a
novel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving
essential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a
pretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics
of real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains
diagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'
identities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population
pre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a
conditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input
space of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to
fine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including
quantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that
SafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant
facial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage. Our evaluations also show
that SafeTriage provides robust privacy protection while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy, offering a secure and ethically sound foundation for data sharing and
AI-driven clinical analysis in neurological disorders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性评估指标忽略空间上下文和解剖结构，导致对定性不同模式（如分散与边界对齐的不确定性）评分相同。

Method: 提出三种结合结构和边界信息的空间感知指标，并在医学影像数据（前列腺分区分割挑战赛）中进行验证。

Result: 新指标与临床重要因素更一致，能更好区分有意义与虚假的不确定性模式。

Conclusion: 空间感知指标显著提升不确定性评估的临床相关性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty maps highlight unreliable regions in segmentation predictions.
However, most uncertainty evaluation metrics treat voxels independently,
ignoring spatial context and anatomical structure. As a result, they may assign
identical scores to qualitatively distinct patterns (e.g., scattered vs.
boundary-aligned uncertainty). We propose three spatially aware metrics that
incorporate structural and boundary information and conduct a thorough
validation on medical imaging data from the prostate zonal segmentation
challenge within the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. Our results demonstrate
improved alignment with clinically important factors and better discrimination
between meaningful and spurious uncertainty patterns.

Motivation: 由于人类感知的主观性和真实世界图像失真的复杂性，图像质量评估（IQA）任务具有挑战性。

Method: MetaQAP结合了质量感知预训练的CNN、质量感知损失函数和元学习集成模型。

Result: 在LiveCD、KonIQ-10K和BIQ2021数据集上，PLCC和SROCC得分分别为0.9885/0.9812、0.9702/0.9658和0.884/0.8765，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MetaQAP不仅解决了真实失真的复杂性，还为IQA领域提供了可扩展的框架和方法论。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of
applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human
perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study
proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these
challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The
model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss
function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an
ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models.
Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD,
KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional
performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman
Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD,
0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing
IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the
generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721
to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The
ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing
substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the
meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only
addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a
robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing
the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable
insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

TL;DR: MM-LG是一种新型框架，通过多模态块提取CLIP中的通用知识，显著提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Learngene方法在多模态场景中处理通用知识的不足，并减少CLIP大规模预训练的计算开销。

Method: 使用多模态和单模态块加权提取通用知识，初始化不同规模和模态的模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能优于现有方法，同时减少75%参数存储和2.8倍预训练成本。

Conclusion: MM-LG高效且通用，适合多样化下游任务部署。

Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread
attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for
downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of
parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a
different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed
as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models
with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable
knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of
utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,
which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework
designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.
Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the
multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.
Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant
models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene
approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and
comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm
(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG
requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8
times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training
and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient
deployment across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 标题设计对模型性能至关重要，研究为文本到图像生成提供了实用的训练数据策略。

Abstract: Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The
quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance.
Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works
shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally
believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide
any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by
systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies
impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments
demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may
introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions
of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and
alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that
varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias
of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in
achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more
effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Stereo Depth estimation is a critical task in autonomous driving and
robotics, where inaccuracies (such as misidentifying nearby objects as distant)
can lead to dangerous situations. Adversarial attacks against stereo depth
estimation can help reveal vulnerabilities before deployment. Previous work has
shown that repeating optimized textures can effectively mislead stereo depth
estimation in digital settings. However, our research reveals that these
naively repeated texture structures perform poorly in physical-world
implementations, i.e., when deployed as patches, limiting their practical
utility for testing stereo depth estimation systems. In this work, for the
first time, we discover that introducing regular intervals between repeated
textures, creating a striped structure, significantly enhances the patch attack
effectiveness. Through extensive experimentation, we analyze how variations of
this novel structure influence the performance. Based on these insights, we
develop a novel stereo depth attack that jointly optimizes both the striped
structure and texture elements. Our generated adversarial patches can be
inserted into any scenes and successfully attack state-of-the-art stereo depth
estimation methods, i.e., RAFT-Stereo and STTR. Most critically, our patch can
also attack commercial RGB-D cameras (Intel RealSense) in real-world
conditions, demonstrating their practical relevance for security assessment of
stereo systems.

Result: 在15个图像和视频基准测试中，LaVi实现了最先进的多模态性能，FLOPs减少94.0%，推理速度提升3.1倍，内存使用减半。

Conclusion: LaVi是一种可扩展且实用的实时多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
existing approaches suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: inefficient
visual-language integration. Current methods either disrupt the model's
inherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,
severely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink
multimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and
efficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token
concatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a
lightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by
injecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of
layer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states
based on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while
preserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational
costs. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate
that LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also
dramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs
by 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half
- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time
multimodal reasoning. The code and models will be released soon.

Conclusion: 结合语言驱动的常识先验显著提升了遮挡视频动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent video action recognition methods have shown excellent performance by
adapting large-scale pre-trained language-image models to the video domain.
However, language models contain rich common sense priors - the scene contexts
that humans use to constitute an understanding of objects, human-object
interactions, and activities - that have not been fully exploited. In this
paper, we introduce a framework incorporating language-driven common sense
priors to identify cluttered video action sequences from monocular views that
are often heavily occluded. We propose: (1) A video context summary component
that generates candidate objects, activities, and the interactions between
objects and activities; (2) A description generation module that describes the
current scene given the context and infers subsequent activities, through
auxiliary prompts and common sense reasoning; (3) A multi-modal activity
recognition head that combines visual and textual cues to recognize video
actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging
Action Genome and Charades datasets.

Conclusion: 本文提出的FSGCD框架在已知信息稀缺的条件下表现出色，为GCD任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While existing Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) models have achieved
significant success, their performance with limited labeled samples and a small
number of known categories remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming
to achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known
information scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary
enhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed
to learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these
boundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary
pre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on
known category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries
using labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided
decision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further
enhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved
pseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown
clusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on
six public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting. The codes are available at:

Conclusion: TeSG通过多层次文本语义引导，有效提升了红外与可见光图像融合的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVF) aims to combine complementary
information from both image modalities, producing more informative and
comprehensive outputs. Recently, text-guided IVF has shown great potential due
to its flexibility and versatility. However, the effective integration and
utilization of textual semantic information remains insufficiently studied. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce textual semantics at two levels: the mask
semantic level and the text semantic level, both derived from textual
descriptions extracted by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Building on
this, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image
fusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is
optimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.
Specifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information
Generator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven
Attentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics
based on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based
fusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask
semantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated
attention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on
downstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 3DeepRep通过多方向低秩表示和自监督优化，显著提升了HSI修复性能。

Abstract: Recent approaches based on transform-based tensor nuclear norm (TNN) have
demonstrated notable effectiveness in hyperspectral image (HSI) inpainting by
leveraging low-rank structures in latent representations. Recent developments
incorporate deep transforms to improve low-rank tensor representation; however,
existing approaches typically restrict the transform to the spectral mode,
neglecting low-rank properties along other tensor modes. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3-directional deep low-rank tensor representation (3DeepRep)
model, which performs deep nonlinear transforms along all three modes of the
HSI tensor. To enforce low-rankness, the model minimizes the nuclear norms of
mode-i frontal slices in the corresponding latent space for each direction
(i=1,2,3), forming a 3-directional TNN regularization. The outputs from the
three directional branches are subsequently fused via a learnable aggregation
module to produce the final result. An efficient gradient-based optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the model in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments on real-world HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior inpainting performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: CoDAF通过统一设计解决了多模态未对齐问题，显著提升了无人机目标检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) object detection plays a vital role in
applications such as environmental monitoring and urban security. To improve
robustness, recent studies have explored multimodal detection by fusing visible
(RGB) and infrared (IR) imagery. However, due to UAV platform motion and
asynchronous imaging, spatial misalignment frequently occurs between
modalities, leading to weak alignment. This introduces two major challenges:
semantic inconsistency at corresponding spatial locations and modality conflict
during feature fusion. Existing methods often address these issues in
isolation, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Cross-modal
Offset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that
jointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.
CoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),
which estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution
guided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the
Dynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances
modality contributions through gating and refines fused features via
spatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a
unified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection. Experiments on
standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, with CoDAF

Abstract: In medical imaging, AI decision-support systems must balance accuracy and
interpretability to build user trust and support effective clinical
decision-making. Recently, Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) and its
variants have emerged as interpretable-by-design modeling techniques, aiming to
explain AI decisions in terms of human-understandable, clinically relevant
concepts. However, existing V-IP methods overlook instance-level uncertainties
in query-answer generation, which can arise from model limitations (epistemic
uncertainty) or variability in expert responses (aleatoric uncertainty).
  This paper introduces Uncertainty-Aware V-IP (UAV-IP), a novel framework that
integrates uncertainty quantification into the V-IP process. We evaluate UAV-IP
across four medical imaging datasets, PH2, Derm7pt, BrEaST, and SkinCon,
demonstrating an average AUC improvement of approximately 3.2% while generating
20% more concise explanations compared to baseline V-IP, without sacrificing
informativeness. These findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware
reasoning in interpretable by design models for robust and reliable medical
decision-making.

Conclusion: NASA-Swin通过噪声模式分析和跨模态特征融合，有效提升了扩散生成图像的检测能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the
advancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has
significantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information
security. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,
diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective
countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising
to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this
problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different
diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.
Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention
(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To
implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,
forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a
cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a
channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When
encountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自监督ViT的层次化特征子集检测方法，用于解决视觉实例搜索中的实例级特征表示问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度特征在实例搜索中表现不佳，尤其是对未知类别对象，需要更有效的实例级特征表示方法。

Method: 利用自监督ViT输出的特征集，通过层次化方式检测紧凑特征子集，生成多语义尺度的实例区域表示。

Result: 在三个实例搜索基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 层次化特征子集检测方法能有效解决对象嵌入和遮挡问题，适用于已知和未知类别对象。

Abstract: Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image
retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of
effective instance level feature representation. Supervised or weakly
supervised object detection methods are not among the options due to their poor
performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the
feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance level region
discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical
fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of feature
subsets. The non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the
various instance regions in an image of different semantic scales. The
hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and
occlusions, which are widely observed in the real scenarios. The features
derived from the nodes on the hierarchy make up a comprehensive representation
for the latent instances in the image. Our instance-level descriptor remains
effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Empirical studies on
three instance search benchmarks show that it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods considerably.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的红外与可见光图像融合方法INRFuse，通过神经网络参数化连续函数，自适应融合多模态信息，无需训练数据集即可生成高质量融合图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外与可见光图像融合旨在结合两种模态的优势，生成信息丰富且满足视觉或计算需求的图像。传统方法依赖离散像素或显式特征，限制了融合效果。

Method: 利用归一化空间坐标作为输入，通过多层感知机自适应融合红外与可见光图像特征，设计多损失函数联合优化融合图像与原图像的相似性。

Result: 实验表明，INRFuse在主观视觉质量和客观评价指标上均优于现有方法，生成的融合图像结构清晰、细节自然、信息丰富。

Conclusion: INRFuse通过隐式神经表示实现了分辨率无关的图像融合，支持超分辨率重建，为多模态图像融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both
modalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual
or computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based
on Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method
parameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly
represent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the
traditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized
spatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,
and multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both
modalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple
loss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused
image and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation
information of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the
visible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of
INR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and
achieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate
queries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing
methods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,
producing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich
information without the necessity for a training dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但因其依赖迭代马尔可夫链过程而计算和资源密集，导致误差累积，限制了压缩技术的效果。

Method: PQ采用两阶段量化，通过动量机制指导自适应位宽转换，减少低精度下的权重扰动；CAD利用全精度校准数据集进行蒸馏，使量化模型能匹配全精度性能。

Result: PQCAD-DM在计算效率和生成质量间取得平衡，推理时间减半，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PQCAD-DM在多样数据集上验证了其优越的生成能力和效率，优于固定位量化方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in image generation but are computational and
resource-intensive due to their reliance on iterative Markov chain processes,
leading to error accumulation and limiting the effectiveness of naive
compression techniques. In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid
compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and
Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs
a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a
momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in
low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during
distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even
with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between
computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while
maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's
superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets,
outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
segmentation and computer-aided diagnosis. In particular, numerous advanced
methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor segmentation
from MRI scans. While recent studies in other medical imaging domains have
revealed that integrating textual reports with visual data can enhance
segmentation accuracy, the field of brain tumor analysis lacks a comprehensive
dataset that combines radiological images with corresponding textual
annotations. This limitation has hindered the exploration of multimodal
approaches that leverage both imaging and textual data.
  To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the TextBraTS dataset, the first
publicly available volume-level multimodal dataset that contains paired MRI
volumes and rich textual annotations, derived from the widely adopted BraTS2020
benchmark. Building upon this novel dataset, we propose a novel baseline
framework and sequential cross-attention method for text-guided volumetric
medical image segmentation. Through extensive experiments with various
text-image fusion strategies and templated text formulations, our approach
demonstrates significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation accuracy,
offering valuable insights into effective multimodal integration techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法在理解退化图像内容时表现不佳，导致重建结果低保真且不自然。

Method: 提出VLCoT框架模拟人类处理退化图像的过程，并引入GRPO优化技术，设计了四种奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明RealSR-R1能生成更真实的细节并准确理解图像内容，尤其在语义丰富或严重退化的场景中。

Conclusion: RealSR-R1通过结合视觉语言推理和GRPO，显著提升了真实世界图像超分辨率的效果。

Abstract: Real-World Image Super-Resolution is one of the most challenging task in
image restoration. However, existing methods struggle with an accurate
understanding of degraded image content, leading to reconstructed results that
are both low-fidelity and unnatural. We present RealSR-R1 in this work, which
empowers the RealSR models with understanding and reasoning capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Chain of Thought (CoT) in large language models
(LLMs), we simulate the human process of handling degraded images and propose
the VLCoT framework, which integrates vision and language reasoning. The
framework aims to precisely restore image details by progressively generating
more comprehensive text and higher-resolution images. To overcome the challenge
of traditional supervised learning CoT failing to generalize to real-world
scenarios, we introduce, for the first time, Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) into the Real-World Image Super-Resolution task. We propose VLCoT-GRPO
as a solution, which designs four reward functions: (1) Format reward, used to
standardize the CoT process; (2) Degradation reward, to incentivize accurate
degradation estimation; (3) Understanding reward, to ensure the accuracy of the
generated content; and (4) Generation reward, where we propose using a visual
expert model to evaluate the quality of generated images, encouraging the model
to generate more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed RealSR-R1 can generate realistic details and accurately understand
image content, particularly in semantically rich scenes or images with severe
degradation.

Result: 在单一生成模型数据上训练后，对多种其他模型生成的视频检测准确率显著提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法简单有效，无需复杂算法或大规模多模型数据集，显著提升检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can
produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually
indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors
have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which
limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to
overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really
matters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on
identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative
architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize
a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative
architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are
unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a
novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet
decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model
to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves
the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for
complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic
generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a
single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of
other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent
results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and
data will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 研究现有视觉模型在稀疏图像共视性推理任务上的表现，探索其与人类能力的差距。

Method: 引入Co-VisiON基准，评估1000多个室内场景的稀疏图像共视性推理，并提出多视图基线模型Covis。

Result: 专有视觉语言模型表现最佳，但所有模型均显著落后于人类。Covis在纯视觉模型中表现最优。

Conclusion: 稀疏共视性推理需要高层次多视图空间理解，未来研究应关注此类能力提升。

Abstract: Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the
overlapping regions visible in multiple images-even when these images are
sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This capability is foundational in
3D vision and robotic perception. Despite significant progress in vision
learning, it remains unclear whether current vision models have reached
human-level proficiency in co-visibility analysis. In this work, we introduce
the Co-Visibility reasONing (Co-VisiON) benchmark, designed to directly
evaluate co-visibility reasoning on sparse image sets across over 1000 indoor
scenarios. Our experiments reveal that while co-visibility is typically treated
as a low-level feature matching task, it poses a significant challenge for
existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary
vision-language model outperforms all purely vision-based approaches, with all
models lagging substantially behind human performance. This gap underscores the
need for more than basic pairwise vision processing-it calls for a
comprehensive spatial understanding through high-level reasoning across
multiple views. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel
multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision
models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and
findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of
robust, high-level reasoning in challenging, sparse environments. Our dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和生成建模方面表现良好，但存在‘看什么’和‘如何编辑’分离的问题，依赖多个独立模型。FOCUS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FOCUS采用双分支视觉编码器捕获全局语义和细粒度空间细节，结合MoVQGAN视觉标记器和多阶段训练管道，优化分割掩码作为空间条件提示。

Result: 实验表明，FOCUS在多模态理解、参考分割准确性和可控图像生成等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过联合优化视觉感知和生成能力，实现了分割感知与细粒度视觉合成的有效结合。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising
capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling
both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current
approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either
perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as
conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple
disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM
that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric
generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual
encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained
spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to
produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable
accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage
training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as
spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns
visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging
segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive
experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding,
referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate
that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception
and generative capabilities.

Conclusion: Loupe通过补丁级融合和条件查询设计，显著提升了分类和定位性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models has raised serious concerns about
visual content forgery. Existing deepfake detection methods primarily target
either image-level classification or pixel-wise localization. While some
achieve high accuracy, they often suffer from limited generalization across
manipulation types or rely on complex architectures. In this paper, we propose
Loupe, a lightweight yet effective framework for joint deepfake detection and
localization. Loupe integrates a patch-aware classifier and a segmentation
module with conditional queries, allowing simultaneous global authenticity
classification and fine-grained mask prediction. To enhance robustness against
distribution shifts of test set, Loupe introduces a pseudo-label-guided
test-time adaptation mechanism by leveraging patch-level predictions to
supervise the segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the DDL dataset
demonstrate that Loupe achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing the
first place in the IJCAI 2025 Deepfake Detection and Localization Challenge
with an overall score of 0.846. Our results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed patch-level fusion and conditional query design in improving both
classification accuracy and spatial localization under diverse forgery
patterns. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/Loupe.

Conclusion: 自监督框架有效提升球检测性能，减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Robust and accurate ball detection is a critical component for autonomous
humanoid soccer robots, particularly in dynamic and challenging environments
such as RoboCup outdoor fields. However, traditional supervised approaches
require extensive manual annotation, which is costly and time-intensive. To
overcome this problem, we present a self-supervised learning framework for
domain-adaptive feature extraction to enhance ball detection performance. The
proposed approach leverages a general-purpose pretrained model to generate
pseudo-labels, which are then used in a suite of self-supervised pretext tasks
-- including colorization, edge detection, and triplet loss -- to learn robust
visual features without relying on manual annotations. Additionally, a
model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) strategy is incorporated to ensure rapid
adaptation to new deployment scenarios with minimal supervision. A new dataset
comprising 10,000 labeled images from outdoor RoboCup SPL matches is
introduced, used to validate the method, and made available to the community.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms
baseline models in terms of accuracy, F1 score, and IoU, while also exhibiting
faster convergence.

Conclusion: AnyTraverse提供了一种车辆无关的越野可通行性方法，平衡自动化与人工监督。

Abstract: Off-road traversability segmentation enables autonomous navigation with
applications in search-and-rescue, military operations, wildlife exploration,
and agriculture. Current frameworks struggle due to significant variations in
unstructured environments and uncertain scene changes, and are not adaptive to
be used for different robot types. We present AnyTraverse, a framework
combining natural language-based prompts with human-operator assistance to
determine navigable regions for diverse robotic vehicles. The system segments
scenes for a given set of prompts and calls the operator only when encountering
previously unexplored scenery or unknown class not part of the prompt in its
region-of-interest, thus reducing active supervision load while adapting to
varying outdoor scenes. Our zero-shot learning approach eliminates the need for
extensive data collection or retraining. Our experimental validation includes
testing on RELLIS-3D, Freiburg Forest, and RUGD datasets and demonstrate
real-world deployment on multiple robot platforms. The results show that
AnyTraverse performs better than GA-NAV and Off-seg while offering a
vehicle-agnostic approach to off-road traversability that balances automation
with targeted human supervision.

Result: 新框架显著提高了校准精度和鲁棒性，优于传统的棋盘格方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为相机校准提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案，并提供了评估指标和指南。

Abstract: Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two
types of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the
corners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is
derived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise
measurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of
circle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.
To surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the
circular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the
checkerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular
patterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid
uncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including
pattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide
guidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation
metric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a
two-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.
The shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an
appropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the
resulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and
robustness. The complete source code and demonstration video are available at

face-swapping methods mainly focus on localized facial replacement neglecting
holistic head morphology, while head-swapping approaches struggling with
hairstyle diversity and complex backgrounds, and none of these methods allow
users to modify the transplanted head expressions after swapping. To tackle
these challenges, our method incorporates several innovative strategies through
a unified latent diffusion paradigm. 1) Identity-preserving context fusion: We
propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy to explicitly disentangle foreground
head identity features from background/body contexts, combining hair
enhancement strategy to achieve robust holistic head identity preservation
across diverse hair types and complex backgrounds. 2) Expression-aware landmark
retargeting and editing: We propose a disentangled 3DMM-driven retargeting
module that decouples identity, expression, and head poses, minimizing the
impact of original expressions in input images and supporting expression
editing. While a scale-aware retargeting strategy is further employed to
minimize cross-identity expression distortion for higher transfer precision.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in seamless background
integration while preserving the identity of the source portrait, as well as
showcasing superior expression transfer capabilities applicable to both real
and virtual characters.

Abstract: Autonomous parking plays a vital role in intelligent vehicle systems,
particularly in constrained urban environments where high-precision control is
required. While traditional rule-based parking systems struggle with
environmental uncertainties and lack adaptability in crowded or dynamic scenes,
human drivers demonstrate the ability to park intuitively without explicit
modeling. Inspired by this observation, we propose a Transformer-based
end-to-end framework for autonomous parking that learns from expert
demonstrations. The network takes as input surround-view camera images,
goal-point representations, ego vehicle motion, and pedestrian trajectories. It
outputs discrete control sequences including throttle, braking, steering, and
gear selection. A novel cross-attention module integrates BEV features with
target points, and a GRU-based pedestrian predictor enhances safety by modeling
dynamic obstacles. We validate our method on the CARLA 0.9.14 simulator in both
vertical and parallel parking scenarios. Experiments show our model achieves a
high success rate of 96.57\%, with average positional and orientation errors of
0.21 meters and 0.41 degrees, respectively. The ablation studies further
demonstrate the effectiveness of key modules such as pedestrian prediction and
goal-point attention fusion. The code and dataset will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型依赖大量配对数据，成本高昂且不现实，本文探索在有限数据下实现多模态对齐的可行性。

Method: 引入STRUCTURE正则化技术，保持单模态编码器潜在空间的几何结构，并优化对齐层选择。

Result: 在24个零样本分类和检索任务中，平均相对提升51.6%（分类）和91.8%（检索）。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限领域提供了高效的多模态学习框架。

Abstract: Multimodal models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in complex tasks
requiring multimodal alignment including zero-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval. However, existing models typically rely on millions of
paired multimodal samples, which are prohibitively expensive or infeasible to
obtain in many domains. In this work, we explore the feasibility of building
multimodal models with limited amount of paired data by aligning pretrained
unimodal foundation models. We show that high-quality alignment is possible
with as few as tens of thousands of paired samples$\unicode{x2013}$less than
$1\%$ of the data typically used in the field. To achieve this, we introduce
STRUCTURE, an effective regularization technique that preserves the
neighborhood geometry of the latent space of unimodal encoders. Additionally,
we show that aligning last layers is often suboptimal and demonstrate the
benefits of aligning the layers with the highest representational similarity
across modalities. These two components can be readily incorporated into
existing alignment methods, yielding substantial gains across 24 zero-shot
image classification and retrieval benchmarks, with average relative
improvement of $51.6\%$ in classification and $91.8\%$ in retrieval tasks. Our
results highlight the effectiveness and broad applicability of our framework
for limited-sample multimodal learning and offer a promising path forward for
resource-constrained domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月球表面缺乏GPS等导航基础设施，传统视觉惯性里程计（VIO）存在漂移问题，需解决长期任务中的精确定位需求。

Method: 通过立体图像提取巨石标志物，构建地形图并与参考地图对齐，实现全局定位。

Result: 在多会话实验中达到亚厘米级精度，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: LunarLoc为月球任务提供可靠定位方案，并公开数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Global localization is necessary for autonomous operations on the lunar
surface where traditional Earth-based navigation infrastructure, such as GPS,
is unavailable. As NASA advances toward sustained lunar presence under the
Artemis program, autonomous operations will be an essential component of tasks
such as robotic exploration and infrastructure deployment. Tasks such as
excavation and transport of regolith require precise pose estimation, but
proposed approaches such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO) accumulate odometry
drift over long traverses. Precise pose estimation is particularly important
for upcoming missions such as the ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) that rely on
autonomous agents to operate over extended timescales and varied terrain. To
help overcome odometry drift over long traverses, we propose LunarLoc, an
approach to global localization that leverages instance segmentation for
zero-shot extraction of boulder landmarks from onboard stereo imagery. Segment
detections are used to construct a graph-based representation of the terrain,
which is then aligned with a reference map of the environment captured during a
previous session using graph-theoretic data association. This method enables
accurate and drift-free global localization in visually ambiguous settings.
LunarLoc achieves sub-cm level accuracy in multi-session global localization
experiments, significantly outperforming the state of the art in lunar global
localization. To encourage the development of further methods for global
localization on the Moon, we release our datasets publicly with a playback
module: https://github.com/mit-acl/lunarloc-data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了LAION-C作为ImageNet-C的替代基准，用于评估模型在web-scale数据集时代的OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如ImageNet-C）的失真类型已不再是OOD，无法有效评估模型在web-scale数据集上的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了六种新型失真类型构建LAION-C，并评估了包括MLLMs在内的先进模型。

Result: LAION-C对当代模型构成显著挑战，且最佳模型已接近或超越人类观察者的表现。

Conclusion: LAION-C为OOD鲁棒性评估提供了更合适的基准，标志着模型性能的范式转变。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a desired property of computer vision
models. Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from
robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets
such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C
corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped
datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG
compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited
for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent
models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that
it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better
at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test
distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a
benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion
types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as
LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that
the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,
including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a
psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for
human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human
robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans
outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best
human observers.

TL;DR: Defusion是一种新型的全能图像修复框架，通过视觉指令引导的退化扩散，解决了传统方法需要针对每种退化类型使用不同模型的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像修复方法需要为每种退化类型（如去模糊、去噪、去雾）设计专用模型，难以应对现实场景中混合或未知的退化问题。

Method: Defusion通过构建明确的视觉指令，捕捉退化特征，并利用这些指令引导扩散模型在退化空间中直接操作，实现高质量的图像重建。

Result: 实验表明，Defusion在多种图像修复任务中优于现有方法，包括复杂和现实中的退化情况。

Conclusion: Defusion提供了一种通用且稳定的图像修复解决方案，适用于多样化的退化场景。

Abstract: Image restoration tasks like deblurring, denoising, and dehazing usually need
distinct models for each degradation type, restricting their generalization in
real-world scenarios with mixed or unknown degradations. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Defusion}, a novel all-in-one image restoration framework that
utilizes visual instruction-guided degradation diffusion. Unlike existing
methods that rely on task-specific models or ambiguous text-based priors,
Defusion constructs explicit \textbf{visual instructions} that align with the
visual degradation patterns. These instructions are grounded by applying
degradations to standardized visual elements, capturing intrinsic degradation
features while agnostic to image semantics. Defusion then uses these visual
instructions to guide a diffusion-based model that operates directly in the
degradation space, where it reconstructs high-quality images by denoising the
degradation effects with enhanced stability and generalizability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that Defusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse image restoration tasks, including complex and real-world
degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResFlow提出了一种基于连续归一化流的图像恢复框架，将退化过程建模为确定性路径，显著提升了性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型将退化过程视为随机变换，导致效率低下和复杂性增加。

Method: ResFlow通过辅助过程消除HQ预测的不确定性，采用熵保持流路径并匹配速度场学习退化流。

Result: ResFlow在不到4个采样步骤内完成任务，在多个图像恢复基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ResFlow为实际应用提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded
low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing
generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based
models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation,
which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow,
a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a
deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the
degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the
uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation
process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented
degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves
the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer
than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow
achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks,
offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.

Motivation: 医学领域的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）推理能力尚处于早期阶段，现有方法缺乏全面框架来搜索和评估有效的诊断推理路径。

Method: 提出MICS方法，通过导师-实习生协作搜索生成高质量的医学CoT数据，并构建MMRP数据集和Chiron-o1模型。

Result: 实验表明，基于MICS生成的CoT数据训练的Chiron-o1在多个医学视觉问答和推理基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MICS方法为医学MLLMs提供了有效的推理路径生成框架，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have begun to demonstrate robust
reasoning capabilities on general tasks, yet their application in the medical
domain remains in its early stages. Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical
MLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a
comprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths
towards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern
Collaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to
generate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor
models to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each
intern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally
selects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning
performance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined
by an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.
Eventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with
ranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum
learning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable
reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Chiron-o1,
trained on our CoT dataset constructed using MICS, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a list of medical visual question answering and reasoning
benchmarks. Codes are available at GitHub - manglu097/Chiron-o1: Enhancing

Result: 在MDS-A数据集上表现优异，适应速度提升7倍，推理速度提升5倍。

Conclusion: Prmpt2Adpt是一种实用且可扩展的实时适应解决方案，适用于低资源领域。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is a critical challenge in real-world
vision systems, especially in resource-constrained environments like drones,
where memory and computation are limited. Existing prompt-driven UDA methods
typically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to
source-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain
adaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by
prompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and
fine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A
small set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain
semantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven
Instance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to
briefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher
then generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly
adaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset
demonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x
faster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and
scalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.

Conclusion: 协作感知能显著提升3D语义占用预测的性能，尤其在长距离预测中效果更明显。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is an emerging perception paradigm in
autonomous driving, providing a voxel-level representation of both geometric
details and semantic categories. However, the perception capability of a single
vehicle is inherently constrained by occlusion, restricted sensor range, and
narrow viewpoints. To address these limitations, collaborative perception
enables the exchange of complementary information, thereby enhancing the
completeness and accuracy. In the absence of a dedicated dataset for
collaborative 3D semantic occupancy prediction, we augment an existing
collaborative perception dataset by replaying it in CARLA with a
high-resolution semantic voxel sensor to provide dense and comprehensive
occupancy annotations. In addition, we establish benchmarks with varying
prediction ranges designed to systematically assess the impact of spatial
extent on collaborative prediction. We further develop a baseline model that
performs inter-agent feature fusion via spatial alignment and attention
aggregation. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline model
consistently outperforms single-agent models, with increasing gains observed as
the prediction range expands.

Conclusion: TripleGAN能有效学习真实退化模式并合成对齐数据集，显著提升超分辨率重建性能。

Abstract: The training of real-world super-resolution reconstruction models heavily
relies on datasets that reflect real-world degradation patterns. Extracting and
modeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only
real-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When
synthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on
degradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise
characteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit
degradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone
cannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the
significant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two
strategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing
the domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs
domain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and
learn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real
data generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR
images. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate
that our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while
maintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts. The
proposed framework effectively learns real-world degradation patterns from LR
observations and synthesizes aligned datasets with corresponding degradation
characteristics, thereby enabling the trained network to achieve superior
performance in reconstructing high-quality SR images from real-world LR inputs.

Method: SnS将变换建模为双目标优化问题，通过图像扰动探究不变性和对抗敏感性。

Conclusion: SnS揭示了不同图像表征对不变性的影响，支持鲁棒CNN作为视觉系统模型的更高保真度。

Abstract: Uncovering which features' combinations high-level visual units encode is
critical to understand how images are transformed into representations that
support recognition. While existing feature visualization approaches typically
infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the
manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is
key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS),
an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically
characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial
perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames
these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe
invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the
representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while
preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks
perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit
activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image
variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those
produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target
unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically
depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:
pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching
mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.
Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by
human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher
fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.

Abstract: Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to
constant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While
Transformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we
observe significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for
tense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art
results on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they
perform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters
are wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the
flows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,
we identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,
we devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,
an attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license
plate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show
that our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly
nearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate
the robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.

Result: 在PartNet上达到最优性能，首次实现复杂真实物体的高质量组装。

Conclusion: Assembler展示了在交互式和组合设计中的潜力，支持高分辨率可编辑物体生成。

Abstract: We present Assembler, a scalable and generalizable framework for 3D part
assembly that reconstructs complete objects from input part meshes and a
reference image. Unlike prior approaches that mostly rely on deterministic part
pose prediction and category-specific training, Assembler is designed to handle
diverse, in-the-wild objects with varying part counts, geometries, and
structures. It addresses the core challenges of scaling to general 3D part
assembly through innovations in task formulation, representation, and data.
First, Assembler casts part assembly as a generative problem and employs
diffusion models to sample plausible configurations, effectively capturing
ambiguities arising from symmetry, repeated parts, and multiple valid
assemblies. Second, we introduce a novel shape-centric representation based on
sparse anchor point clouds, enabling scalable generation in Euclidean space
rather than SE(3) pose prediction. Third, we construct a large-scale dataset of
over 320K diverse part-object assemblies using a synthesis and filtering
pipeline built on existing 3D shape repositories. Assembler achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PartNet and is the first to demonstrate
high-quality assembly for complex, real-world objects. Based on Assembler, we

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合知识获取与积累（KAA）和基于一致性的主动学习（CAL）的新系统，用于解决驾驶场景多标签分类中的数据集不平衡和任务学习平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动驾驶车辆对复杂驾驶环境的理解能力，解决多标签分类中数据集不平衡和任务学习平衡的挑战。

Method: 通过KAA从单标签数据集中获取知识，再通过CAL解决属性分布差异导致的知识差距。

Result: 在DSI数据集上性能提升56.1%，KAA贡献31.3%，CAL贡献24.8%。在BDD100K和HSD数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，且数据使用量减少85%。

Conclusion: KAA-CAL系统在多标签驾驶场景识别中表现优异，显著提升了性能和数据效率。

Abstract: Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class
labels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing
autonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the
complex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is
better tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a
multi-label classification model for driving scene identification through
multitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,
comprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across
different tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes
knowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active
learning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates
knowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via
monotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap
caused by the discrepancy between the marginal distributions of individual
attributes and their joint distribution. An ablation study on our Driving Scene
Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% performance increase over the
baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of this, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the
gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover, KAA-CAL stands out as the best
performer when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-label models on two
public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving this while using 85% less data. The
DSI dataset and the implementation code for KAA-CAL are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEXA是一个无需训练的框架，通过动态选择和聚合专家模型实现多模态推理，适用于多样化任务和领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推理面临输入模态多样性和任务复杂性的挑战，需要统一的框架来高效整合专家模型。

Method: MEXA动态选择专家模型生成文本推理输出，并通过大型推理模型（LRM）聚合结果。

Result: 在多种多模态基准测试中，MEXA性能优于基线模型，展示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: MEXA通过模块化设计实现了高效、透明的多模态推理，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Combining pre-trained expert models offers substantial potential for scalable
multimodal reasoning, but building a unified framework remains challenging due
to the increasing diversity of input modalities and task complexity. For
instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical
tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to
make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a
training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of
multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse
and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input
modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert
model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual
reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a
Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design
allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains
without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on
diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D
Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance
improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness
and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in
diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RGBTrack为无需深度输入的实时6D姿态跟踪提供了高效且实用的解决方案，适用于多种应用领域。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework, RGBTrack, for real-time 6D pose estimation
and tracking that operates solely on RGB data, thereby eliminating the need for
depth input for such dynamic and precise object pose tracking tasks. Building
on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy
combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and
generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable
tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions,
RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman
filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition,
RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale
using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern
generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves
competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical
solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality,
and computer vision.

Result: 实现了源识别和篡改检测，动态水印具有可控的灵敏度-鲁棒性权衡。

Conclusion: pgSPAD成像器在数字水印领域具有潜力，动态水印技术可行且有效。

Abstract: Digital image watermarks as a security feature can be derived from the
imager's physically unclonable functions (PUFs) by utilizing the manufacturing
variations, i.e., the dark signal non-uniformity (DSNU). While a few
demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors
(APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been
investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel
watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized
the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m
standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test
images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source
identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed
source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable
sensitivity-robustness trade-off.

Result: 在两个多模态数据集上验证了方法的优越性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下具有解决医学图像分割任务的潜力。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning addresses the issue of limited annotations in
medical images effectively, but its performance is often inadequate for complex
backgrounds and challenging tasks. Multi-modal fusion methods can significantly
improve the accuracy of medical image segmentation by providing complementary
information. However, they face challenges in achieving significant
improvements under semi-supervised conditions due to the challenge of
effectively leveraging unlabeled data. There is a significant need to create an
effective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled
data in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which
leverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with
limited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and
enhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,
while reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and
alignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to
constrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the
robustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental
results on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and
robustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for
solving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 物体计数模型在跨域部署时因密度变化导致性能下降，传统域适应假设无法处理任务相关的密度变化。

Method: 提出条件特征对齐框架，通过划分域为子集并测量条件差异，推导出联合误差界，证明条件对齐优于无条件对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个密度分布不同的计数数据集上优于现有无监督域适应方法。

Conclusion: 条件特征对齐能有效保留任务相关信息并过滤无关变化，提升跨域计数的泛化性能。

Abstract: Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing
density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate
standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a
theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the
notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets
(e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then
derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as
condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on
the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These
insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving
task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve
superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining
conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a
practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in
unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with
varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms
existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the
theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.

Motivation: 传统视频分析方法计算成本高且复杂，而专家评论提供了丰富的细粒度描述和上下文线索，足以可靠地识别关键动作。

Method: 使用SoccerNet Echoes数据集中的时间戳评论，通过三个LLMs（分别专注于结果、兴奋度和战术）评估滑动窗口的评论，生成准确的事件时间戳。

Result: 实验表明，这种基于语言的方法能有效检测关键比赛事件，提供了一种无需训练的轻量级替代方案。

Conclusion: 语言中心的方法为动作检测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，优于传统视频方法。

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on
visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to
process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this
video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable
by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained
descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,
contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To
demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides
timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges
specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding
windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,
generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this
language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match
events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional
video-based methods for action spotting.

Result: 在多种CT和组织病理学数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Co-Seg++显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和多功能性。

Abstract: Medical image analysis is critical yet challenged by the need of jointly
segmenting organs or tissues, and numerous instances for anatomical structures
and tumor microenvironment analysis. Existing studies typically formulated
different segmentation tasks in isolation, which overlooks the fundamental
interdependencies between these tasks, leading to suboptimal segmentation
performance and insufficient medical image understanding. To address this
issue, we propose a Co-Seg++ framework for versatile medical segmentation.
Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing semantic
and instance segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. We first devise
a spatio-temporal prompt encoder (STP-Encoder) to capture long-range spatial
and temporal relationships between segmentation regions and image embeddings as
prior spatial constraints. Moreover, we devise a multi-task collaborative
decoder (MTC-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the
contextual consistency of both tasks, jointly computing semantic and instance
segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on diverse CT and histopathology
datasets demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg++ outperforms state-of-the-arts
in the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of dental anatomical
structures, histopathology tissues, and nuclei instances. The source code is

Abstract: There now exists many popular object detectors based on deep learning that

objects over time and preserving object identity can help to improve object
detection performance, and is necessary for many downstream tasks, including
classifying and predicting behaviors, and estimating total abundances. Here we
present yasmot, a lightweight and flexible object tracker that can process the

Abstract: Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer
interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial
expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to
train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a
through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when
extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose
facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify
outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial
landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their
displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression.
Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a
random forest classifier.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have
enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the
groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current
methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and
efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To
address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for
high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve
fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a
shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between
various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid
history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences
autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to
enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to
reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long
temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex
interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset
comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games,
ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated
synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data
significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly
outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of
interactive game video generation.

Conclusion: UniFork通过平衡共享学习和任务专业化，有效解决了统一模型中的模态对齐冲突。

Abstract: Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising
paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the
optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge.
In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of
task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as
current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:
understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment
across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better
comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality
alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to
recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a
fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform
representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks.
Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture
that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while
employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference.
This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization.
Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork
consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures,
and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.

Abstract: Articulated objects are common in the real world, yet modeling their
structure and motion remains a challenging task for 3D reconstruction methods.
In this work, we introduce Part$^{2}$GS, a novel framework for modeling
articulated digital twins of multi-part objects with high-fidelity geometry and
physically consistent articulation. Part$^{2}$GS leverages a part-aware 3D
Gaussian representation that encodes articulated components with learnable
attributes, enabling structured, disentangled transformations that preserve
high-fidelity geometry. To ensure physically consistent motion, we propose a
motion-aware canonical representation guided by physics-based constraints,
including contact enforcement, velocity consistency, and vector-field
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a field of repel points to prevent part
collisions and maintain stable articulation paths, significantly improving
motion coherence over baselines. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and
real-world datasets show that Part$^{2}$GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by up to 10$\times$ in Chamfer Distance for movable

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point
trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and
benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a

scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified
next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion
simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between
closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable
long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in
short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other
methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在需要视觉想象的任务中表现受限，因为它们只能通过文本解码表达视觉推理。显式图像生成又可能损害推理能力。

Method: 提出Mirage框架，通过潜在视觉标记（而非显式图像）实现多模态推理，结合蒸馏学习和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，Mirage在不生成显式图像的情况下显著提升了多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: Mirage为VLM提供了一种高效的多模态推理方法，避免了显式图像生成的负担。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their
text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting
performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs
to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often
hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental
imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we
investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories
without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental
Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent
visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses
to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby
continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin
by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image
embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent
trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement
learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger
multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent
videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally
establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce
DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this
question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo
ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to
systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention
mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to
establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key
similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal
matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the
denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in
zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models.
Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a
novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos
without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into
the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further
research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLN-R1是一个端到端框架，利用大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）将第一人称视频流直接转换为连续导航动作，通过GRPO训练和两阶段微调实现高效导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语言模型的导航系统受限于离散拓扑图，无法实现连续路径规划。VLN-R1旨在通过LVLM直接处理视频流，提升导航的灵活性和效率。

Method: 采用GRPO训练和两阶段微调：1）监督微调（SFT）对齐专家演示；2）强化微调（RFT）结合时间衰减奖励（TDR）机制。

Result: 在VLN-CE基准测试中表现优异，证明LVLM可通过数据高效的后训练驱动导航和任务推理。

Conclusion: VLN-R1展示了LVLM在具身导航中的潜力，通过奖励驱动的训练提升任务特定推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,
requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language
instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on
discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node
connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams
into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by
DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego
dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling
to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can
supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level
control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with
expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced
with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights
multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong
performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied
navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,
reward-driven post-training.

*Khurram Yamin,Gaurav Ghosal,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在知识密集型任务中表现优异，但在新环境中整合参数化知识与新信息时表现不佳，尤其是反事实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs能否通过上下文结合参数化知识，特别是在反事实推理任务中。

Method: 通过合成和真实实验，研究LLMs在多跳推理问题中的表现。

Result: LLMs在反事实推理中表现不佳，常依赖参数化知识；简单微调可能导致知识退化。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在新环境中重新利用参数化知识的能力存在局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to contain extensive world knowledge in
their parameters, enabling impressive performance on many knowledge intensive
tasks. However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter
situations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or
unfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine
knowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of
counterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop
reasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual
reasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.
Moreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill
counterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored
parametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of
current LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPECS的延迟感知测试时扩展方法，通过结合小模型生成候选序列和大模型评估，在降低延迟的同时保持或提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要优化计算资源（FLOPS）而忽略延迟约束，影响用户体验。SPECS旨在解决这一缺陷。

Method: SPECS利用小模型高效生成候选序列，结合大模型和奖励模型评估候选序列，并引入奖励引导的软验证和延迟机制。

Result: 在MATH500等数据集上，SPECS在降低延迟19.1%的同时，匹配或超越束搜索的准确性。

Conclusion: SPECS通过延迟感知设计，有效平衡了计算资源与用户体验，理论分析表明其收敛性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has driven the recent advances in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), typically by allocating
additional computation for more thorough exploration. However, increased
compute often comes at the expense of higher user-facing latency, directly
impacting user experience. Current test-time scaling methods primarily optimize
for accuracy based on total compute resources (FLOPS), often overlooking
latency constraints. To address this gap, we propose $\texttt{SPECS}$, a
latency-aware test-time scaling method inspired by speculative decoding.
$\texttt{SPECS}$~uses a smaller, faster model to generate candidate sequences
efficiently, and evaluates these candidates using signals from both a larger
target model and a dedicated reward model. We introduce new integration
strategies, including reward-guided soft verification and a reward-based
deferral mechanism. Empirical results on MATH500, AMC23 and OlympiadBench
datasets show that $\texttt{SPECS}$~matches or surpasses beam search accuracy
while reducing latency by up to $\sim$19.1\%. Our theoretical analysis shows
that our algorithm converges to the solution of a KL-regularized reinforcement
learning objective with increasing beam width.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“安全提醒”的软提示调优方法，通过优化可学习的提示标记来增强视觉语言模型（VLM）的安全性，防止有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLM）在代码生成和聊天机器人辅助等实际应用中的能力增强，确保其安全性变得至关重要。VLM因其多模态特性面临独特的安全漏洞，攻击者可能通过修改视觉或文本输入绕过安全防护，触发有害内容生成。

Method: 通过系统分析VLM在攻击下的行为，作者发现了一种称为“延迟安全感知”的现象。基于此，提出了一种软提示调优方法“安全提醒”，通过优化可学习的提示标记，在文本生成过程中定期注入以增强安全感知。

Result: 在三个安全基准和一个对抗攻击测试中，该方法显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了模型在良性任务上的性能。

Conclusion: “安全提醒”提供了一种实用的解决方案，可在不影响正常对话的情况下增强VLM的安全性，适用于实际应用部署。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate increasing capabilities across
real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance,
ensuring their safety has become paramount. Unlike traditional Large Language
Models (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,
allowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety
guardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic
analysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed
``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs
may initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually
recognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern
suggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a
temporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize
that VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully
designed prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft
prompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are
periodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety
awareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our
safety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal
conversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign
tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety
benchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,
offering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world
applications.

Motivation: 识别触发语言模型特定行为或潜在特征的输入，对安全应用具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了上下文修改方法，并开发了ContextBench基准测试。改进EPO方法，结合LLM辅助和扩散模型修复。

Result: 改进后的EPO方法在激活效果和语言流畅性上达到最优。

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡激活效果和流畅性方面表现优异，为安全应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Identifying inputs that trigger specific behaviours or latent features in
language models could have a wide range of safety use cases. We investigate a
class of methods capable of generating targeted, linguistically fluent inputs
that activate specific latent features or elicit model behaviours. We formalise
this approach as context modification and present ContextBench -- a benchmark
with tasks assessing core method capabilities and potential safety
applications. Our evaluation framework measures both elicitation strength
(activation of latent features or behaviours) and linguistic fluency,
highlighting how current state-of-the-art methods struggle to balance these
objectives. We enhance Evolutionary Prompt Optimisation (EPO) with
LLM-assistance and diffusion model inpainting, and demonstrate that these
variants achieve state-of-the-art performance in balancing elicitation
effectiveness and fluency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理时隐藏有害目标的能力，并开发了SHADE-Arena数据集进行评估。结果显示，前沿模型在隐藏任务完成和避免检测方面表现有限，但监控模型能较好区分良性/恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在复杂任务中作为自主代理的部署增多，评估其隐藏有害目标的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 使用SHADE-Arena数据集评估LLMs在完成主任务和隐藏有害任务时的能力，同时测试监控模型的检测效果。

Result: 前沿模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.5 Pro在隐藏任务中表现有限（27%和15%），监控模型Gemini 2.5 Pro的AUC为0.87。

Conclusion: 当前模型在隐藏任务中仍有困难，但监控模型表现较好，未来更复杂任务可能增加监控难度。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
agents in complex and long horizon settings, it is critical to evaluate their
ability to sabotage users by pursuing hidden objectives. We study the ability
of frontier LLMs to evade monitoring and achieve harmful hidden goals while
completing a wide array of realistic tasks. We evaluate a broad range of
frontier LLMs using SHADE (Subtle Harmful Agent Detection & Evaluation)-Arena,
the first highly diverse agent evaluation dataset for sabotage and monitoring
capabilities of LLM agents. SHADE-Arena consists of complex pairs of benign
main tasks and harmful side objectives in complicated environments. Agents are
evaluated on their ability to complete the side task without appearing
suspicious to an LLM monitor. When measuring agent ability to (a) complete the
main task, (b) complete the side task, and (c) avoid detection, we find that
the best performing frontier models score 27% (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) and 15%
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) as sabotage agents when overseen by Claude 3.6 Sonnet. For
current frontier models, success on the side task relies heavily on having
access to a hidden scratchpad that is not visible to the monitor. We also use
SHADE-Arena to measure models' monitoring abilities, with the top monitor
(Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieving an AUC of 0.87 at distinguishing benign and malign
transcripts. We find that for now, models still struggle at sabotage due to
failures in long-context main task execution. However, our measurements already
demonstrate the difficulty of monitoring for subtle sabotage attempts, which we
expect to only increase in the face of more complex and longer-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 当前Agentic AI研究缺乏标准化和公平比较，难以衡量不同设计选择的影响。

Method: 在GAIA基准和BrowseComp上进行系统实证研究，分析关键组件设计选择的影响，并提出新评估协议。

Result: 发现缺乏标准评估协议导致研究不可复现，设计冗余；提出OAgents框架，性能领先。

Conclusion: OAgents框架为Agentic AI研究提供了模块化设计和标准化评估，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic AI has become an increasingly popular research field.
However, we argue that current agent research practices lack standardization
and scientific rigor, making it hard to conduct fair comparisons among methods.
As a result, it is still unclear how different design choices in agent
frameworks affect effectiveness, and measuring their progress remains
challenging. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study on GAIA
benchmark and BrowseComp to examine the impact of popular design choices in key
agent components in a fair and rigorous manner. We find that the lack of a
standard evaluation protocol makes previous works, even open-sourced ones,
non-reproducible, with significant variance between random runs. Therefore, we
introduce a more robust evaluation protocol to stabilize comparisons. Our study
reveals which components and designs are crucial for effective agents, while
others are redundant, despite seeming logical. Based on our findings, we build
and open-source OAgents, a new foundation agent framework that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source projects. OAgents offers a
modular design for various agent components, promoting future research in
Agentic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或启发式技术，效果不佳，因此需要一种更高效的方法来确保LLMs的安全性。

Method: 提出Sysformer模型，在LLM输入嵌入空间中动态调整系统提示，保持LLM参数不变，训练模型拒绝有害提示并优化安全提示响应。

Result: 实验表明，Sysformer显著提升了LLMs的鲁棒性，对有害提示的拒绝率提升高达80%，对安全提示的响应优化高达90%，并能有效抵御复杂的越狱攻击。

Conclusion: Sysformer提供了一种低成本且高效的LLMs安全保障方法，并启发了未来对可变系统提示设计的研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in safety-critical settings, it
is essential to ensure that their responses comply with safety standards. Prior
research has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe
behaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the
generation of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to
improve their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of
model parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we
take a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts
in instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a
fixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt
to each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we
propose $\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\textbf{former}$ model that updates an
initial $\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM
input embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM
parameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of
harmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through
extensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent
benchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the
robustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful
prompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\%$.
Results also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs
upto $100\%$ more robust against different attack strategies. We hope our
findings lead to cheaper safeguarding of LLMs and motivate future
investigations into designing variable system prompts.

Result: CIfly在性能上优于传统方法，支持Python和R调用，并成功应用于多种因果推断任务。

Conclusion: CIfly为图形因果推断提供了灵活、可扩展的框架，推动了算法开发与高效部署。

Abstract: We introduce CIfly, a framework for efficient algorithmic primitives in
graphical causal inference that isolates reachability as a reusable core
operation. It builds on the insight that many causal reasoning tasks can be
reduced to reachability in purpose-built state-space graphs that can be
constructed on the fly during traversal. We formalize a rule table schema for
specifying such algorithms and prove they run in linear time. We establish
CIfly as a more efficient alternative to the common primitives moralization and
latent projection, which we show are computationally equivalent to Boolean
matrix multiplication. Our open-source Rust implementation parses rule table
text files and runs the specified CIfly algorithms providing high-performance
execution accessible from Python and R. We demonstrate CIfly's utility by
re-implementing a range of established causal inference tasks within the
framework and by developing new algorithms for instrumental variables. These
contributions position CIfly as a flexible and scalable backbone for graphical
causal inference, guiding algorithm development and enabling easy and efficient
deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DOCSAT的随机局部搜索启发式算法，用于解决3-SAT问题，显著优于现有方法，尤其在处理极难实例时表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如WalkSAT容易陷入局部极小值，导致无法找到真正解。DOCSAT通过减少过满足约束来解决这一问题。

Method: DOCSAT通过消散过满足约束（DOC）来避免局部极小值陷阱，利用统计结构优化搜索过程。

Result: 在N=15000的极难3-SAT实例上，DOCSAT表现优于WalkSAT和Kissat等算法，尤其在解决最难的实例时。

Conclusion: DOCSAT提供了一种利用统计结构避免局部极小值的新方法，可推广至其他组合优化问题。

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the
NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing
solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our
construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous
approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are
distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied
combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm,
coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their
unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark
our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT
instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find
that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including
the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the
hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors.
The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure
beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape
local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for
generalization to other optimization problems.

TL;DR: SLR是一个端到端框架，用于通过可扩展的逻辑推理系统评估和训练大型语言模型（LLMs）。它自动化生成推理任务，创建SLR-Bench基准，并揭示当前LLMs在逻辑推理上的不足。逻辑调优显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在逻辑推理任务上表现不佳，需要一种自动化、可扩展的方法来评估和改进其推理能力。

Method: SLR框架自动化生成推理任务，包括潜在规则、验证程序和指令提示。创建SLR-Bench基准，涵盖20个难度递增的课程级别。

Result: 当代LLMs在逻辑推理上表现有限，逻辑调优使Llama-3-8B性能翻倍，达到与Gemini-Flash-Thinking相当的水平。

Conclusion: SLR为LLMs的推理能力提供了自动化、可扩展的评估和训练环境，无需人工标注，确保数据集新颖性。

Abstract: We introduce SLR, an end-to-end framework for systematic evaluation and
training of Large Language Models (LLMs) via Scalable Logical Reasoning. Given
a user's task specification, SLR enables scalable, automated synthesis of
inductive reasoning tasks with precisely controlled difficulty. For each task,
SLR synthesizes (i) a latent ground-truth rule, (ii) an executable validation
program used by a symbolic judge to deterministically verify model outputs, and
(iii) an instruction prompt for the reasoning task. Using SLR, we create
SLR-Bench, a benchmark comprising over 19k prompts spanning 20 curriculum
levels that progressively increase in relational, arithmetic, and recursive
complexity. Large-scale evaluation reveals that contemporary LLMs readily
produce syntactically valid rules, yet often fail at correct logical inference.
Recent reasoning LLMs do somewhat better, but incur substantial increases in
test-time compute, sometimes exceeding 15k completion tokens. Finally,
logic-tuning via SLR doubles Llama-3-8B accuracy on SLR-Bench, achieving parity
with Gemini-Flash-Thinking at a fraction of computational cost. SLR is fully
automated, requires no human annotation, ensures dataset novelty, and offers a
scalable environment for probing and advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for agentic AI systems in
mission-critical negotiation contexts, addressing the need for AI agents that
can adapt to diverse human operators and stakeholders. Using Sotopia as a
simulation testbed, we present two experiments that systematically evaluated
how personality traits and AI agent characteristics influence LLM-simulated
social negotiation outcomes--a capability essential for a variety of
applications involving cross-team coordination and civil-military interactions.
Experiment 1 employs causal discovery methods to measure how personality traits
impact price bargaining negotiations, through which we found that Agreeableness
and Extraversion significantly affect believability, goal achievement, and
knowledge acquisition outcomes. Sociocognitive lexical measures extracted from
team communications detected fine-grained differences in agents' empathic
communication, moral foundations, and opinion patterns, providing actionable
insights for agentic AI systems that must operate reliably in high-stakes
operational scenarios. Experiment 2 evaluates human-AI job negotiations by
manipulating both simulated human personality and AI system characteristics,
specifically transparency, competence, adaptability, demonstrating how AI agent
trustworthiness impact mission effectiveness. These findings establish a
repeatable evaluation methodology for experimenting with AI agent reliability
across diverse operator personalities and human-agent team dynamics, directly
supporting operational requirements for reliable AI systems. Our work advances
the evaluation of agentic AI workflows by moving beyond standard performance
metrics to incorporate social dynamics essential for mission success in complex
operations.

Abstract: The exponential expansion of scientific literature has surpassed the
epistemic processing capabilities of both human experts and current artificial
intelligence systems. This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted
Authority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises
belief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured
scientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and
evaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and
temporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian
inference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The
architecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility
modelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification. By
formalising scientific reasoning into a computationally verifiable epistemic
network, BEWA advances the foundation for machine reasoning systems that
promote truth utility, rational belief convergence, and audit-resilient

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的价值函数，用于解决强化学习中的双目标约束问题，并通过改进的PPO算法（DO-HJ-PPO）验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习中的硬约束会降低策略性能，而拉格朗日方法需要复杂的奖励工程和参数调整。本文旨在通过Hamilton-Jacobi方程与强化学习的结合，提供更高效的双目标约束解决方案。

Method: 提出两种新的价值函数，分别解决Reach-Always-Avoid和Reach-Reach问题，并通过分解为reach、avoid和reach-avoid问题，推导出显式的Bellman形式。基于此，改进PPO算法（DO-HJ-PPO）。

Result: DO-HJ-PPO在安全到达和多目标实现任务中表现出色，行为与现有方法不同，并在多个指标上优于基线。

Conclusion: 本文为约束决策提供了新视角，并通过实验验证了DO-HJ-PPO的有效性。

Abstract: Hard constraints in reinforcement learning (RL), whether imposed via the
reward function or the model architecture, often degrade policy performance.
Lagrangian methods offer a way to blend objectives with constraints, but often
require intricate reward engineering and parameter tuning. In this work, we
extend recent advances that connect Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations with RL to
propose two novel value functions for dual-objective satisfaction. Namely, we
address: (1) the Reach-Always-Avoid problem - of achieving distinct reward and
penalty thresholds - and (2) the Reach-Reach problem - of achieving thresholds
of two distinct rewards. In contrast with temporal logic approaches, which
typically involve representing an automaton, we derive explicit, tractable
Bellman forms in this context by decomposing our problem into reach, avoid, and
reach-avoid problems, as to leverage these aforementioned recent advances. From
a mathematical perspective, the Reach-Always-Avoid and Reach-Reach problems are
complementary and fundamentally different from standard sum-of-rewards problems
and temporal logic problems, providing a new perspective on constrained
decision-making. We leverage our analysis to propose a variation of Proximal
Policy Optimization (DO-HJ-PPO), which solves these problems. Across a range of
tasks for safe-arrival and multi-target achievement, we demonstrate that
DO-HJ-PPO produces qualitatively distinct behaviors from previous approaches
and out-competes a number of baselines in various metrics.

TL;DR: 生成式AI在解决桌面应用任务时存在高延迟问题，研究发现模型调用和任务步骤增加是主要原因，且现有代理效率低下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式AI系统在桌面任务中因高延迟而难以实用，需研究其时间性能以指导未来开发。

Method: 在OSWorld基准上研究计算机代理的时间性能，构建OSWorld-Human数据集评估代理效率。

Result: 模型调用和任务步骤增加导致高延迟，现有代理步骤比必要多1.4-2.7倍。

Conclusion: 需优化模型调用和任务步骤以减少延迟，提升代理效率。

Abstract: Generative AI is being leveraged to solve a variety of computer-use tasks
involving desktop applications. State-of-the-art systems have focused solely on
improving accuracy on leading benchmarks. However, these systems are
practically unusable due to extremely high end-to-end latency (e.g., tens of
minutes) for tasks that typically take humans just a few minutes to complete.
To understand the cause behind this and to guide future developments of
computer agents, we conduct the first study on the temporal performance of
computer-use agents on OSWorld, the flagship benchmark in computer-use AI. We
find that large model calls for planning and reflection account for the
majority of the overall latency, and as an agent uses more steps to complete a
task, each successive step can take 3x longer than steps at the beginning of a
task. We then construct OSWorld-Human, a manually annotated version of the
original OSWorld dataset that contains a human-determined trajectory for each
task. We evaluate 16 agents on their efficiency using OSWorld-Human and found
that even the highest-scoring agents on OSWorld take 1.4-2.7x more steps than
necessary.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于本体的过程模型验证机制，用于确保制造过程中参数依赖关系的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造过程中参数依赖关系的建模需要一致性和语义连贯性，以支持跨上下文应用和知识重用。

Result: 通过树脂传递模塑（RTM）的用例验证了方法的适用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为机器可解释和可验证的工程模型提供了支持。

Abstract: The formalization of process knowledge using ontologies enables consistent
modeling of parameter interdependencies in manufacturing. These
interdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that
define relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as
calculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application
and knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and
applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data
retrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required
to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the
completeness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.
This paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed
ontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,
data element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs. The approach
includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic
classification, and (iii) a data completeness check to validate the
evaluability of interdependencies. The applicability of the approach is
demonstrated with a use case from Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), supporting the
development of machine-interpretable and verifiable engineering models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络的方法，用于预测数值黑盒优化中算法的性能，通过捕捉问题、算法配置和性能之间的复杂关系，相比传统表格方法提升了36.6%的MSE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略算法配置对性能的影响，而问题特征与算法性能之间的关系更适合用图结构表示。

Method: 使用异构图数据结构和图神经网络，对两种模块化框架（modCMA-ES和modDE）的变体进行评估，覆盖多种问题和预算。

Result: 在24个BBOB问题和不同预算下，相比传统表格方法，MSE提升了36.6%。

Conclusion: 几何学习在黑盒优化中具有潜力，图神经网络能有效捕捉复杂依赖关系。

Abstract: Automated algorithm performance prediction in numerical blackbox optimization
often relies on problem characterizations, such as exploratory landscape
analysis features. These features are typically used as inputs to machine
learning models and are represented in a tabular format. However, such
approaches often overlook algorithm configurations, a key factor influencing
performance. The relationships between algorithm operators, parameters, problem
characteristics, and performance outcomes form a complex structure best
represented as a graph. This work explores the use of heterogeneous graph data
structures and graph neural networks to predict the performance of optimization
algorithms by capturing the complex dependencies between problems, algorithm
configurations, and performance outcomes. We focus on two modular frameworks,
modCMA-ES and modDE, which decompose two widely used derivative-free
optimization algorithms: the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE). We evaluate 324 modCMA-ES and 576
modDE variants on 24 BBOB problems across six runtime budgets and two problem
dimensions. Achieving up to 36.6% improvement in MSE over traditional
tabular-based methods, this work highlights the potential of geometric learning
in black-box optimization.

<details>

Motivation: 探究LLMs与人类在决策行为上的差异，以评估其作为人类决策替代品的潜力与风险。

Method: 使用三种心理学实验任务，对五种领先LLMs和360名人类参与者进行决策行为测试。

Result: LLMs在任务中表现优于人类，接近最优水平，但其决策机制与人类显著不同。

Conclusion: LLMs在管理不确定性、风险校准和适应变化方面表现出色，但其与人类决策的差异提示需谨慎依赖其作为替代品。

Abstract: Human decision-making belongs to the foundation of our society and
civilization, but we are on the verge of a future where much of it will be
delegated to artificial intelligence. The arrival of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has transformed the nature and scope of AI-supported decision-making;
however, the process by which they learn to make decisions, compared to humans,
remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the decision-making
behavior of five leading LLMs across three core dimensions of real-world
decision-making: uncertainty, risk, and set-shifting. Using three
well-established experimental psychology tasks designed to probe these
dimensions, we benchmarked LLMs against 360 newly recruited human participants.
Across all tasks, LLMs often outperformed humans, approaching near-optimal
performance. Moreover, the processes underlying their decisions diverged
fundamentally from those of humans. On the one hand, our finding demonstrates
the ability of LLMs to manage uncertainty, calibrate risk, and adapt to
changes. On the other hand, this disparity highlights the risks of relying on
them as substitutes for human judgment, calling for further inquiry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFT在非单调推理形式中广泛应用，但在某些情况下表现受限，因此需要更精细的近似方法。

Method: 提出更一般的近似空间概念，研究其表达能力及不同近似空间之间的关系。

Result: 展示了改进的表达能力，并验证了新方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩展后的AFT能够处理更复杂的近似问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT) is a powerful theory covering various
semantics of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms in knowledge representation
such as Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming. Many semantics of such
non-monotonic formalisms can be characterized as suitable fixpoints of a
non-monotonic operator on a suitable lattice. Instead of working on the
original lattice, AFT operates on intervals in such lattice to approximate or
construct the fixpoints of interest. While AFT has been applied successfully
across a broad range of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, it is confronted by
its limitations in other, relatively simple, examples. In this paper, we
overcome those limitations by extending consistent AFT to deal with
approximations that are more refined than intervals. Therefore, we introduce a
more general notion of approximation spaces, showcase the improved
expressiveness and investigate relations between different approximation
spaces.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化提示框架，通过分解推理步骤结合神经与符号方法，提升LLMs在逻辑一致性任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在规则应用和可解释性方面存在不足，尤其是在需要精确逻辑推理的领域（如法律分析）。

Method: 框架将推理分解为三个可验证步骤：实体识别、属性提取和符号规则应用，结合神经与符号方法，并通过形式验证确保逻辑一致性。

Result: 在LegalBench任务中，该方法显著优于基线，OpenAI o-family模型的F1分数分别达到0.929和0.867。

Conclusion: 该混合神经符号系统为透明且一致的基于规则的推理提供了可行路径，适用于结构化法律推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in complex reasoning tasks but struggle
with consistent rule application, exception handling, and explainability,
particularly in domains like legal analysis that require both natural language
understanding and precise logical inference. This paper introduces a structured
prompting framework that decomposes reasoning into three verifiable steps:
entity identification, property extraction, and symbolic rule application. By
integrating neural and symbolic approaches, our method leverages LLMs'
interpretive flexibility while ensuring logical consistency through formal
verification. The framework externalizes task definitions, enabling domain
experts to refine logical structures without altering the architecture.
Evaluated on the LegalBench hearsay determination task, our approach
significantly outperformed baselines, with OpenAI o-family models showing
substantial improvements - o1 achieving an F1 score of 0.929 and o3-mini
reaching 0.867 using structured decomposition with complementary predicates,
compared to their few-shot baselines of 0.714 and 0.74 respectively. This
hybrid neural-symbolic system offers a promising pathway for transparent and
consistent rule-based reasoning, suggesting potential for explainable AI
applications in structured legal reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态评估范式无法动态评估交互环境中的风险，阻碍了具身代理在现实家庭任务中的安全部署。

Method: 提出IS-Bench基准，包含161个场景和388个安全风险，支持过程导向评估，验证风险缓解步骤的顺序。

Result: 实验显示当前VLM代理缺乏交互安全意识，安全感知的Chain-of-Thought虽能提升性能，但常牺牲任务完成率。

Conclusion: IS-Bench为开发更安全的具身AI系统奠定了基础，揭示了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety
hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However,
existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess
risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic
risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc
evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive
emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We
thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive
safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks
instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel
process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are
performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on
leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current
agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware
Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion.
By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for
developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

Conclusion: 自动化方法有效替代人工，显著提升用户参与度，具有广泛部署潜力。

Abstract: Consumer applications provide ample opportunities to surface and communicate
various forms of content to users. From promotional campaigns for new features
or subscriptions, to evergreen nudges for engagement, or personalised
recommendations; across e-mails, push notifications, and in-app surfaces. The
conventional approach to orchestration for communication relies heavily on
labour-intensive manual marketer work, and inhibits effective personalisation
of content, timing, frequency, and copy-writing. We formulate this task under a
sequential decision-making framework, where we aim to optimise a modular
decision-making policy that maximises incremental engagement for any funnel
event. Our approach leverages a Difference-in-Differences design for Individual
Treatment Effect estimation, and Thompson sampling to balance the
explore-exploit trade-off. We present results from a multi-service application,
where our methodology has resulted in significant increases to a variety of
goal events across several product features, and is currently deployed across
150 million users.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力接近或超越人类水平，AI驱动的开发比人类中心方法更高效，但现有LLM代理无法充分利用探索经验，导致低效和性能不佳。

Method: ML-Master采用选择性记忆机制，高效整合并行解决方案的多样见解与分析推理，避免信息过载。

Result: 在MLE-Bench上，ML-Master平均奖牌率为29.3%，显著超越现有方法，尤其在中等复杂度任务中，且时间仅为基线的一半。

Conclusion: ML-Master展示了作为AI4AI强大工具的潜力，能有效推动AI系统设计的自动化与优化。

Abstract: As AI capabilities advance toward and potentially beyond human-level
performance, a natural transition emerges where AI-driven development becomes
more efficient than human-centric approaches. A promising pathway toward this
transition lies in AI-for-AI (AI4AI), which leverages AI techniques to automate
and optimize the design, training, and deployment of AI systems themselves.
While LLM-based agents have shown the potential to realize AI4AI, they are
often unable to fully leverage the experience accumulated by agents during the
exploration of solutions in the reasoning process, leading to inefficiencies
and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose ML-Master, a
novel AI4AI agent that seamlessly integrates exploration and reasoning by
employing a selectively scoped memory mechanism. This approach allows ML-Master
to efficiently combine diverse insights from parallel solution trajectories
with analytical reasoning, guiding further exploration without overwhelming the
agent with excessive context. We evaluate ML-Master on the MLE-Bench, where it
achieves a 29.3% average medal rate, significantly surpassing existing methods,
particularly in medium-complexity tasks, while accomplishing this superior
performance within a strict 12-hour time constraint-half the 24-hour limit used
by previous baselines. These results demonstrate ML-Master's potential as a
powerful tool for advancing AI4AI.

Conclusion: 该方法提高了有害内容分析的可靠性，减少了误报，适用于大规模数据集，有助于构建更安全、包容的工作环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for organizational
research. However, their built-in moderation systems can create problems when
researchers try to analyze harmful content, often refusing to follow certain
instructions or producing overly cautious responses that undermine validity of
the results. This is particularly problematic when analyzing organizational
conflicts such as microaggressions or hate speech. This paper introduces an Elo
rating-based method that significantly improves LLM performance for harmful
content analysis In two datasets, one focused on microaggression detection and
the other on hate speech, we find that our method outperforms traditional LLM
prompting techniques and conventional machine learning models on key measures
such as accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. Advantages include better
reliability when analyzing harmful content, fewer false positives, and greater
scalability for large-scale datasets. This approach supports organizational
applications, including detecting workplace harassment, assessing toxic
communication, and fostering safer and more inclusive work environments.

Conclusion: 构建开放的知识工程框架是解决AI知识资源不足的关键方向。

Abstract: The long-standing goal of creating a comprehensive, multi-purpose knowledge
resource, reminiscent of the 1984 Cyc project, still persists in AI. Despite
the success of knowledge resources like WordNet, ConceptNet, Wolfram|Alpha and
other commercial knowledge graphs, verifiable, general-purpose widely available
sources of knowledge remain a critical deficiency in AI infrastructure. Large
language models struggle due to knowledge gaps; robotic planning lacks
necessary world knowledge; and the detection of factually false information
relies heavily on human expertise. What kind of knowledge resource is most
needed in AI today? How can modern technology shape its development and
evaluation? A recent AAAI workshop gathered over 50 researchers to explore
these questions. This paper synthesizes our findings and outlines a
community-driven vision for a new knowledge infrastructure. In addition to
leveraging contemporary advances in knowledge representation and reasoning, one
promising idea is to build an open engineering framework to exploit knowledge
modules effectively within the context of practical applications. Such a
framework should include sets of conventions and social structures that are
adopted by contributors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在PPM中预测准确性高，但其缺乏可解释性影响了用户信任和采用。XAI旨在解决这一问题，但当前评估忽略了用户中心视角。

Method: 通过决策实验，比较不同解释风格（特征重要性、基于规则、反事实）和感知准确性（高或低）对用户决策的影响，测量任务表现、一致性和决策信心。

Result: 研究发现感知准确性和解释风格对用户决策有显著影响。

Conclusion: 强调了在PPM中结合用户中心视角评估XAI的重要性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) often uses deep learning models to
predict the future behavior of ongoing processes, such as predicting process
outcomes. While these models achieve high accuracy, their lack of
interpretability undermines user trust and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to address this challenge by providing the reasoning behind the predictions.
However, current evaluations of XAI in PPM focus primarily on functional
metrics (such as fidelity), overlooking user-centered aspects such as their
effect on task performance and decision-making. This study investigates the
effects of explanation styles (feature importance, rule-based, and
counterfactual) and perceived AI accuracy (low or high) on decision-making in
PPM. We conducted a decision-making experiment, where users were presented with
the AI predictions, perceived accuracy levels, and explanations of different
styles. Users' decisions were measured both before and after receiving
explanations, allowing the assessment of objective metrics (Task Performance
and Agreement) and subjective metrics (Decision Confidence). Our findings show
that perceived accuracy and explanation style have a significant effect.

Conclusion: 低维模型通过直观变量支持战术分析和决策，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Understanding football tactics is crucial for managers and analysts. Previous
research has proposed models based on spatial and kinematic equations, but
these are computationally expensive. Also, Reinforcement learning approaches
use player positions and velocities but lack interpretability and require large
datasets. Rule-based models align with expert knowledge but have not fully
considered all players' states. This study explores whether low-dimensional,
rule-based models using spatiotemporal data can effectively capture football
tactics. Our approach defines interpretable state variables for both the
ball-holder and potential pass receivers, based on criteria that explore
options like passing. Through discussions with a manager, we identified key
variables representing the game state. We then used StatsBomb event data and
SkillCorner tracking data from the 2023$/$24 LaLiga season to train an XGBoost
model to predict pass success. The analysis revealed that the distance between
the player and the ball, as well as the player's space score, were key factors
in determining successful passes. Our interpretable low-dimensional modeling
facilitates tactical analysis through the use of intuitive variables and
provides practical value as a tool to support decision-making in football.

Result: 实验证明所提机制能有效加速模型收敛并激励代理参与。

Conclusion: 该框架为联邦学习中的激励机制和数据异构性问题提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for facilitating
collaboration between multiple clients that jointly learn a global model
without directly sharing their local data. However, existing research suffers
from two caveats: 1) From the perspective of agents, voluntary and unselfish
participation is often assumed. But self-interested agents may opt out of the
system or provide low-quality contributions without proper incentives; 2) From
the mechanism designer's perspective, the aggregated models can be
unsatisfactory as the existing game-theoretical federated learning approach for
data collection ignores the potential heterogeneous effort caused by
contributed data. To alleviate above challenges, we propose an incentive-aware
framework for agent participation that considers data heterogeneity to
accelerate the convergence process. Specifically, we first introduce the notion
of Wasserstein distance to explicitly illustrate the heterogeneous effort and
reformulate the existing upper bound of convergence. To induce truthful
reporting from agents, we analyze and measure the generalization error gap of
any two agents by leveraging the peer prediction mechanism to develop score
functions. We further present a two-stage Stackelberg game model that
formalizes the process and examines the existence of equilibrium. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed mechanism.

Abstract: The success of vehicle electrification, which brings significant societal and
environmental benefits, is contingent upon the availability of efficient and
adaptable charging infrastructure. Traditional fixed-location charging stations
often face issues like underutilization or congestion due to the dynamic nature
of charging demand. Mobile chargers have emerged as a flexible solution,
capable of relocating to align with these demand fluctuations. This paper
addresses the optimal planning and operation of hybrid charging
infrastructures, integrating both fixed and mobile chargers within urban road
networks. We introduce the Hybrid Charging Station Planning and Operation
(HCSPO) problem, which simultaneously optimizes the location and configuration
of fixed charging stations and schedules mobile chargers for dynamic
operations. Our approach incorporates a charging demand prediction model
grounded in Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance decision-making. To solve
the HCSPO problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method, augmented
with heuristic scheduling techniques, to effectively bridge the planning of
fixed chargers with the real-time operation of mobile chargers. Extensive case
studies using real-world urban scenarios demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the availability of charging infrastructure and reduces
user inconvenience compared to existing solutions and baselines.

Abstract: Image generation models are revolutionizing many domains, and urban analysis
and design is no exception. While such models are widely adopted, there is a
limited literature exploring their geographic knowledge, along with the biases
they embed. In this work, we generated 150 synthetic images for each state in
the USA and related capitals using FLUX 1 and Stable Diffusion 3.5, two
state-of-the-art models for image generation. We embed each image using DINO-v2
ViT-S/14 and the Fr\'echet Inception Distances to measure the similarity
between the generated images. We found that while these models have implicitly
learned aspects of USA geography, if we prompt the models to generate an image
for "United States" instead of specific cities or states, the models exhibit a
strong representative bias toward metropolis-like areas, excluding rural states
and smaller cities. {\color{black} In addition, we found that models
systematically exhibit some entity-disambiguation issues with European-sounding
names like Frankfort or Devon.

Result: 在移动用户的无线通信系统中验证了方法的动态适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态离散环境中表现出色，适用于实时系统优化。

Abstract: Many real-time systems require the optimization of discrete variables.
Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms and multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms
perform optimization by repeatedly taking actions and observing the
corresponding instant rewards without any prior knowledge. Recently, a BBO
method using an Ising machine has been proposed to find the best action that is
represented by a combination of discrete values and maximizes the instant
reward in static environments. In contrast, dynamic environments, where
real-time systems operate, necessitate MAB algorithms that maximize the average
reward over multiple trials. However, due to the enormous number of actions
resulting from the combinatorial nature of discrete optimization, conventional
MAB algorithms cannot effectively optimize dynamic, discrete environments.
Here, we show a heuristic MAB method for dynamic, discrete environments by
extending the BBO method, in which an Ising machine effectively explores the
actions while considering interactions between variables and changes in dynamic
environments. We demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the proposed method in
a wireless communication system with moving users.

Abstract: Effective and efficient task planning is essential for mobile robots,
especially in applications like warehouse retrieval and environmental
monitoring. These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of
several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem
(GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To
address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that
leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary
aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality
task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a
coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially
informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling
strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a
multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective
integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that
our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required
for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its
practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 改进的LfD算法在麻将游戏中有效提升了代理性能和风格多样性。

Abstract: A wide variety of bots in games enriches the gameplay experience and enhances
replayability. Recent advancements in game artificial intelligence have
predominantly focused on improving the proficiency of bots. Nevertheless,
developing highly competent bots with a wide range of distinct play styles
remains a relatively under-explored area. We select the Mahjong game
environment as a case study. The high degree of randomness inherent in the
Mahjong game and the prevalence of out-of-distribution states lead to
suboptimal performance of existing offline learning and
Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) algorithms. In this paper, we leverage the
gameplay histories of existing Mahjong agents and put forward a novel LfD
algorithm that necessitates only minimal modifications to the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm. The comprehensive empirical results illustrate that our
proposed method not only significantly enhances the proficiency of the agents
but also effectively preserves their unique play styles.

2020 that prevent the representation of realizable entities of generically

the use of defined classes and (b) a proposal of changes that allow BFO to
support functions, dispositions, and roles of generically dependent
continuants.

Conclusion: DREAM有效提升了LLMs在复杂数学推理中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方法和数据集。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising first-order logic (FOL)
reasoning capabilities with applications in various areas. However, their
effectiveness in complex mathematical reasoning involving multi-step FOL
deductions is still under-researched. While LLMs perform competitively on
established mathematical reasoning benchmarks, they struggle with multi-step
FOL tasks, as demonstrated by Deepseek-Prover-V2-7B's low accuracy (4.2%) on
our proposed theorem proving dataset. This issue arises from the limited
exploration of diverse proof strategies and the potential for early reasoning
mistakes to undermine entire proofs. To address these issues, we propose DREAM,
a self-adaptive solution that enhances the Diversity and REAsonability of LLMs'
generation strategies. DREAM incorporates an Axiom-Driven Strategy
Diversification mechanism to promote varied strategic outcomes and a
Sub-Proposition Error Feedback to help LLMs reflect on and correct their
proofs. Our contributions include pioneering advancements in LLMs' mathematical
reasoning through FOL theorem proving, introducing a novel inference stage
solution that improves performance by 0.6% to 6.4%, and providing a curated
dataset of 447 mathematical theorems in Lean 4 format for evaluation.

Abstract: The creation of benchmarks to evaluate the safety of Large Language Models is
one of the key activities within the trusted AI community. These benchmarks
allow models to be compared for different aspects of safety such as toxicity,
bias, harmful behavior etc. Independent benchmarks adopt different approaches
with distinct data sets and evaluation methods. We investigate how robust such
benchmarks are by using different approaches to rank a set of representative
models for bias and compare how similar are the overall rankings. We show that
different but widely used bias evaluations methods result in disparate model
rankings. We conclude with recommendations for the community in the usage of
such benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在数学问题上的高准确率掩盖了其真正的推理缺陷，需通过数学证明的复杂性揭示这些隐藏问题。

Method: 引入RFMDataset（200个多样化的数学证明问题），评估高级模型的表现，并分析其失败原因。

Result: 发现模型在数学证明中表现不佳（正确率低于20%），存在10种细粒度错误类型，包括单步推理缺乏正确性保证、幻觉和不完整性。

Conclusion: 模型的自我反思不足以解决逻辑困境，需通过形式化和细粒度的逻辑训练提升推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (e.g., R1, o3) have demonstrated remarkable
mathematical problem-solving abilities. However, the high reported accuracy of
these advanced models on popular datasets, reliance on purely numerical
evaluation and potential benchmark leakage, often masks their true reasoning
shortcomings. To address this, we propose leveraging the inherent rigor and
methodological complexity of mathematical proofs as a diagnostic tool to expose
these hidden failures. Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal
Failure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and
thoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it. Our in-depth analysis
of their failures uncovers 10 fine-grained error types, which shows fundamental
limitations in current large reasoning models: 1) large reasoning models
grapple profoundly with mathematical proofs, with some generating entirely
correct proofs for less than 20% of problems and failing even on basic ones; 2)
models exhibit a diverse spectrum of reasoning failures, prominently
demonstrating the lack of guarantees for the correctness and rigor of
single-step reasoning; and 3) models show hallucination and incompleteness
during the reasoning process. Our findings reveal that models' self-reflection
is insufficient to resolve the current logical dilemmas, necessitating
formalized and fine-grained logical training.

Conclusion: 提出了"思想MDP"模型，为理解模型无关RL中的"思考"行为提供了理论基础，并展望了其在非语言生成领域的应用。

Abstract: Recent work on large language models has demonstrated the use of model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning-like capabilities. The emergence
of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither
produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is
more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent
understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for
reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a
theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process}
(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an
abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP
model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether
or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent
to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing
to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our
theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like
behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable
thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy
domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought
actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式资源协作系统中，由于网络动态性和信息收集延迟，难以全面评估设备信任度。

Method: 将信任评估分为多阶段，每阶段仅收集相关属性数据，并利用生成式AI进行快速分析。

Result: 实验表明该框架在信任评估中具有高准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂协作系统中的信任评估问题。

Abstract: In collaborative systems with complex tasks relying on distributed resources,
trust evaluation of potential collaborators has emerged as an effective
mechanism for task completion. However, due to the network dynamics and varying
information gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and
collect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a
comprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust
evaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of
misaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task
completion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages
based on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion
process, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant
to that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By
leveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning
capabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the
collected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices
deemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.
The framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves
high accuracy in trust evaluation.

Result: LLMs对性别和风格扰动更敏感，人类专家对格式变化更敏感。

Conclusion: 需要动态评估框架以衡量LLMs与人类在临床环境中的决策相似性。

Abstract: Clinical robustness is critical to the safe deployment of medical Large
Language Models (LLMs), but key questions remain about how LLMs and humans may
differ in response to the real-world variability typified by clinical settings.
To address this, we introduce MedPerturb, a dataset designed to systematically
evaluate medical LLMs under controlled perturbations of clinical input.
MedPerturb consists of clinical vignettes spanning a range of pathologies, each
transformed along three axes: (1) gender modifications (e.g., gender-swapping
or gender-removal); (2) style variation (e.g., uncertain phrasing or colloquial
tone); and (3) format changes (e.g., LLM-generated multi-turn conversations or
summaries). With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts
grounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three
human expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies
to reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect
diverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are
more sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are
more sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical
summaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go
beyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and
LLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.

Conclusion: 特征预条件化对开发高效、鲁棒的防御方法至关重要。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a cornerstone defense, but many variants
overlook foundational feature representations by primarily focusing on stronger
attack generation. We introduce Adversarial Evolution Training (AET), a simple
yet powerful framework that strategically prepends an Empirical Risk
Minimization (ERM) phase to conventional AT. We hypothesize this initial ERM
phase cultivates a favorable feature manifold, enabling more efficient and
effective robustness acquisition. Empirically, AET achieves comparable or
superior robustness more rapidly, improves clean accuracy, and cuts training
costs by 8-25\%. Its effectiveness is shown across multiple datasets,
architectures, and when augmenting established AT methods. Our findings
underscore the impact of feature pre-conditioning via standard training for
developing more efficient, principled robust defenses. Code is available in the

Abstract: Label Proportion Learning (LLP) addresses the classification problem where
multiple instances are grouped into bags and each bag contains information
about the proportion of each class. However, in practical applications,
obtaining precise supervisory information regarding the proportion of instances
in a specific class is challenging. To better align with real-world application
scenarios and effectively leverage the proportional constraints of instances
within tuples, this paper proposes a generalized learning framework
\emph{MDPU}. Specifically, we first mathematically model the distribution of
instances within tuples of arbitrary size, under the constraint that the number
of positive instances is no less than that of negative instances. Then we
derive an unbiased risk estimator that satisfies risk consistency based on the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) method. To mitigate the inevitable
overfitting issue during training, a risk correction method is introduced,
leading to the development of a corrected risk estimator. The generalization
error bounds of the unbiased risk estimator theoretically demonstrate the
consistency of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
and comparisons with other relevant baseline methods comprehensively validate
the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Result: S²GPT-PINN以极少的参数实现了高效计算，性能优于传统PINNs。

Conclusion: S²GPT-PINN为特定领域PDEs提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose S$^2$GPT-PINN, a sparse and small model for solving parametric
partial differential equations (PDEs). Similar to Small Language Models (SLMs),
S$^2$GPT-PINN is tailored to domain-specific (families of) PDEs and
characterized by its compact architecture and minimal computational power.
Leveraging a small amount of extremely high quality data via a mathematically
rigorous greedy algorithm that is enabled by the large full-order models,
S$^2$GPT-PINN relies on orders of magnitude less parameters than PINNs to
achieve extremely high efficiency via two levels of customizations. The first
is knowledge distillation via task-specific activation functions that are
transferred from Pre-Trained PINNs. The second is a judicious down-sampling
when calculating the physics-informed loss of the network compressing the
number of data sites by orders of magnitude to the size of the small model.

Abstract: Cellular traffic prediction is of great importance for operators to manage
network resources and make decisions. Traffic is highly dynamic and influenced
by many exogenous factors, which would lead to the degradation of traffic
prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an end-to-end framework with two
variants to explicitly characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of cellular
traffic among neighboring cells. It uses convolutional neural networks with an
attention mechanism to capture the spatial dynamics and Kalman filter for
temporal modelling. Besides, we can fully exploit the auxiliary information
such as social activities to improve prediction performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our
proposed models outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in

Motivation: 当前旋转量化方法存在两个问题：(i) 旋转未能对齐通道均值，导致量化范围更宽和舍入误差增加；(ii) 旋转使激活分布更接近高斯分布，增加了截断误差的能量损失。

Method: 引入BASE-Q方法，结合偏置校正和非对称缩放，减少误差，并支持分块优化。

Result: 实验表明，BASE-Q显著缩小了与全精度模型的准确率差距，相比QuaRot、SpinQuant和OSTQuant分别提升了50.5%、42.9%和29.2%。

Conclusion: BASE-Q是一种简单而强大的方法，有效解决了当前旋转量化的局限性，并具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines
for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights
and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers
only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead:
due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to
enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited
practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of
current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel
means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors;
and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like,
increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we
introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias
correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping
errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the
need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on
various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing
the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\%
compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be
released soon.

*Tianyu Wang,Lingyou Pang,Akira Horiguchi,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM Web Dynamics (LWD)框架，研究网络级模型崩溃问题，通过模拟互联网和理论分析揭示输出收敛模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管合成数据提升了LLM训练效率，但模型崩溃的潜在威胁尚未充分研究，现有研究多限于单一模型或统计替代。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)数据库模拟互联网，分析模型输出收敛模式，并通过高斯混合模型理论提供收敛保证。

Result: 揭示了模型在网络级的收敛行为，并提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: LWD框架为研究模型崩溃提供了新视角，强调了网络级分析的重要性。

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced
data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the
potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing
studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely
solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics
(LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network
level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to
interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.

TL;DR: 该论文通过线性模型分析潜在动作模型（LAMs）的学习过程，探讨了其是否捕捉到动作相关变化或噪声，并提出了改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LAMs是否真正捕捉到动作相关变化，而非无关噪声，以提升模型的有效性。

Method: 提出一个可分析的线性模型，结合数据增强、数据清理和辅助动作预测策略。

Result: 揭示了LAM与PCA的联系，并通过数值模拟验证了数据结构和噪声对学习的影响。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，提出了优化LAM学习的具体策略。

Abstract: Latent action models (LAMs) aim to learn action-relevant changes from
unlabeled videos by compressing changes between frames as latents. However,
differences between video frames can be caused by controllable changes as well
as exogenous noise, leading to an important concern -- do latents capture the
changes caused by actions or irrelevant noise? This paper studies this issue
analytically, presenting a linear model that encapsulates the essence of LAM
learning, while being tractable.This provides several insights, including
connections between LAM and principal component analysis (PCA), desiderata of
the data-generating policy, and justification of strategies to encourage
learning controllable changes using data augmentation, data cleaning, and
auxiliary action-prediction. We also provide illustrative results based on
numerical simulation, shedding light on the specific structure of observations,
actions, and noise in data that influence LAM learning.

Result: MLE-STAR在44%的Kaggle竞赛中表现优异，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MLE-STAR通过外部知识和细粒度探索策略，显著提升了机器学习工程代理的性能。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering
(MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However,
existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM
knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code
structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific
models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as
experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these,
we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first
leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective
models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it
by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This
exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual
code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an
effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that
MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench,
significantly outperforming the best alternative.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Hamilton-Jacobi可达性分析的可验证无模型安全滤波器，解决了学习型安全滤波器缺乏形式化安全保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型安全滤波器虽优于传统方法（如手工设计的CBFs），但缺乏形式化安全保证，因此需要一种可验证的无模型安全滤波器。

Method: 1) 扩展Q值函数的可验证自一致性性质；2) 提出乘法Q网络结构以减少零子集收缩问题；3) 开发验证管道以验证这些自一致性性质。

Result: 在四个标准安全控制基准测试中成功合成了形式化验证的无模型安全证书。

Conclusion: 该方法为学习型安全滤波器提供了形式化安全保证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent learning-based safety filters have outperformed conventional methods,
such as hand-crafted Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), by effectively adapting
to complex constraints. However, these learning-based approaches lack formal
safety guarantees. In this work, we introduce a verifiable model-free safety
filter based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis. Our primary
contributions include: 1) extending verifiable self-consistency properties for
Q value functions, 2) proposing a multiplicative Q-network structure to
mitigate zero-sublevel-set shrinkage issues, and 3) developing a verification
pipeline capable of soundly verifying these self-consistency properties. Our
proposed approach successfully synthesizes formally verified, model-free safety
certificates across four standard safe-control benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合非线性特征提取、分类和高效优化的框架，通过核主成分分析降维、多层感知机预测疾病状态，以及并行遗传算法优化超参数，在多个数据集上取得了优于其他方法的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在疾病预测中面临计算成本高和优化效率低的问题，因此需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 使用核主成分分析降维，多层感知机分类，并行遗传算法优化超参数。

Result: 在乳腺癌、帕金森病和慢性肾病数据集上分别达到99.12%、94.87%和100%的准确率，优于其他优化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过并行化和非线性特征提取显著提高了分类性能和优化效率。

Abstract: This study introduces a framework that integrates nonlinear feature
extraction, classification, and efficient optimization. First, kernel principal
component analysis with a radial basis function kernel reduces dimensionality
while preserving 95% of the variance. Second, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
learns to predict disease status. Finally, a modified multiprocessing genetic
algorithm (MIGA) optimizes MLP hyperparameters in parallel over ten
generations. We evaluated this approach on three datasets: the Wisconsin
Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, the Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, and
the chronic kidney disease dataset. The MLP tuned by the MIGA achieved the best
accuracy of 99.12% for breast cancer, 94.87% for Parkinson's disease, and 100%
for chronic kidney disease. These results outperform those of other methods,
such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Compared with a
standard genetic algorithm, kernel PCA revealed nonlinear relationships that
improved classification, and the MIGA's parallel fitness evaluations reduced
the tuning time by approximately 60%. The genetic algorithm incurs high
computational cost from sequential fitness evaluations, but our multiprocessing
interface GA (MIGA) parallelizes this step, slashing the tuning time and
steering the MLP toward the best accuracy score of 99.12%, 94.87%, and 100% for
breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, and CKD, respectively.

Result: 框架实现了可解释、稳健且可复现的Simulink仿真代码生成。

Conclusion: SimuGen通过多模态和模块化设计，有效提升了Simulink代码生成的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, LLMs still
struggle in the simulation domain, particularly in generating Simulink models,
which are essential tools in engineering and scientific research. Our
preliminary experiments indicate that LLM agents often fail to produce reliable
and complete Simulink simulation code from text-only inputs, likely due to the
lack of Simulink-specific data in their pretraining. To address this challenge,
we propose SimuGen, a multimodal agent-based framework that automatically
generates accurate Simulink simulation code by leveraging both the visual
Simulink diagram and domain knowledge. SimuGen coordinates several specialized
agents, including an investigator, unit test reviewer, code generator,
executor, debug locator, and report writer, supported by a domain-specific
knowledge base. This collaborative and modular design enables interpretable,
robust, and reproducible Simulink simulation generation. Our source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/renxinxing123/SimuGen_beta.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Cancer（CoC）的多模态框架，结合临床数据和语言描述进行癌症患者生存预测，通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖病理学和基因组学数据，忽略了甲基化数据和语言描述的作用。作者首次探索了四种模态（包括语言）的联合使用。

Method: 提出CoC框架，包括域内学习（intra-learning）和域间学习（inter-learning），利用语言提示和自回归互牵引模块实现多模态协同表征。

Result: 在五个公开癌症数据集上验证，实验结果表明该方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CoC框架通过多模态联合学习显著提升了生存预测的准确性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Survival prediction aims to evaluate the risk level of cancer patients.
Existing methods primarily rely on pathology and genomics data, either
individually or in combination. From the perspective of cancer pathogenesis,
epigenetic changes, such as methylation data, could also be crucial for this
task. Furthermore, no previous endeavors have utilized textual descriptions to
guide the prediction. To this end, we are the first to explore the use of four
modalities, including three clinical modalities and language, for conducting
survival prediction. In detail, we are motivated by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
to propose the Chain-of-Cancer (CoC) framework, focusing on intra-learning and
inter-learning. We encode the clinical data as the raw features, which remain
domain-specific knowledge for intra-learning. In terms of inter-learning, we
use language to prompt the raw features and introduce an Autoregressive Mutual
Traction module for synergistic representation. This tailored framework
facilitates joint learning among multiple modalities. Our approach is evaluated
across five public cancer datasets, and extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our methods and proposed designs, leading to producing \sota
results. Codes will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图方法在空间域边界附近表现不佳，因为它们过于依赖相邻点，而忽略了全局关系。

Method: 提出相似性望远镜模块捕捉全局关系，并引入相似性缩放策略调节多切片整合中的距离。

Result: 实验证明Spotscape在单切片和多切片任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: Spotscape有效提升了空间转录组学数据的分析能力。

Abstract: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) is a cutting-edge technique that
captures the spatial context of cells within tissues, enabling the study of
complex biological networks. Recent graph-based methods leverage both gene
expression and spatial information to identify relevant spatial domains.
However, these approaches fall short in obtaining meaningful spot
representations, especially for spots near spatial domain boundaries, as they
heavily emphasize adjacent spots that have minimal feature differences from an
anchor node. To address this, we propose Spotscape, a novel framework that
introduces the Similarity Telescope module to capture global relationships
between multiple spots. Additionally, we propose a similarity scaling strategy
to regulate the distances between intra- and inter-slice spots, facilitating
effective multi-slice integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of Spotscape in various downstream tasks, including single-slice
and multi-slice scenarios. Our code is available at the following link: https:

TL;DR: 论文提出了BLUR基准，用于更真实地评估大型语言模型的遗忘能力，揭示了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型遗忘基准存在遗忘集和保留集差异过大的问题，导致评估结果失真，可能在实际部署中引发安全问题。

Method: 提出了BLUR基准，通过扩展评估任务、结合遗忘/保留查询以及提供不同难度的再学习数据集，提供更真实的评估场景。

Result: 在BLUR基准上，现有方法的性能显著下降，简单方法表现优于最新方法。

Conclusion: BLUR基准强调了鲁棒评估的重要性，并为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning has the potential to improve the safety of large language
models (LLMs) by removing sensitive or harmful information post hoc. A key
challenge in unlearning involves balancing between forget quality (effectively
unlearning undesirable information) and retain quality (maintaining good
performance on other, general tasks). Unfortunately, as we show, current LLM
unlearning benchmarks contain highly disparate forget and retain sets --
painting a false picture of the effectiveness of LLM unlearning methods. This
can be particularly problematic because it opens the door for benign
perturbations, such as relearning attacks, to easily reveal supposedly
unlearned knowledge once models are deployed. To address this, we present
$\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic
scenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on
existing unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined
forget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of
difficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that
the performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on
$\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more
recent methods. These results highlight the importance of robust evaluation and
suggest several important directions of future study. Our benchmark is publicly

*Minjae Cho,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto,Huy Trong Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将控制收缩度量（CCM）与强化学习（RL）结合的方法，称为收缩演员-评论家（CAC），以解决CCM在动态模型已知性和最优性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCM虽然能确保系统轨迹收敛，但缺乏全局最优性，且依赖已知动态模型和复杂计算。

Method: 通过CAC算法，结合CCM的动态反馈和RL的长期最优性，自动学习收缩度量生成器和最优跟踪策略。

Result: 实验证明CAC在模拟和真实机器人任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAC成功扩展了CCM的应用范围，为不确定动态系统提供了自动化且最优的控制解决方案。

Abstract: Control contraction metrics (CCMs) provide a framework to co-synthesize a
controller and a corresponding contraction metric -- a positive-definite
Riemannian metric under which a closed-loop system is guaranteed to be
incrementally exponentially stable. However, the synthesized controller only
ensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single
trajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an
entire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics
model and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex
feasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring
high dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to
integrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide
dynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize
cumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,
called contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs
to provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in
a fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC
simultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a
contraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal
tracking policy guided by that metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm relative to established baselines through extensive empirical
studies, including simulated and real-world robot experiments, and provide a
theoretical rationale for incorporating contraction theory into RL.

Conclusion: RL训练的LLM在编译器优化中具有强大潜力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Compiler auto-tuning optimizes pass sequences to improve performance metrics
such as Intermediate Representation (IR) instruction count. Although recent
advances leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
automating compiler tuning, two significant challenges still remain: the
absence of high-quality reasoning datasets for agents training, and limited
effective interactions with the compilation environment. In this work, we
introduce Compiler-R1, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework
specifically augmenting LLM capabilities for compiler auto-tuning. Compiler-R1
features a curated, high-quality reasoning dataset and a novel two-stage
end-to-end RL training pipeline, enabling efficient environment exploration and
learning through an outcome-based reward. Extensive experiments across seven
datasets demonstrate Compiler-R1 achieving an average 8.46% IR instruction
count reduction compared to opt -Oz, showcasing the strong potential of
RL-trained LLMs for compiler optimization. Our code and datasets are publicly

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为minifinetuning（MFT）的方法，用于在低数据环境下减少语言模型微调时的过拟合和性能退化问题，效果优于标准微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在新领域的微调通常会导致其通用性能下降，尤其是在数据资源有限的情况下。

Method: MFT采用样本级别的自蒸馏技术，无需预训练数据回放，显著降低了过拟合导致的性能退化。

Result: MFT在多种模型和领域中表现出2-10倍的优势，且对数据稀缺（低至500样本）具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MFT不仅优于参数高效的微调方法，还能与其他方法结合使用，进一步减少性能退化。

Abstract: Finetuning language models for a new domain inevitably leads to the
deterioration of their general performance. This becomes more pronounced the
more limited the finetuning data resource.
  We introduce minifinetuning (MFT), a method for language model domain
adaptation that considerably reduces the effects of overfitting-induced
degeneralization in low-data settings and which does so in the absence of any
pre-training data for replay. MFT demonstrates 2-10x more favourable
specialization-to-degeneralization ratios than standard finetuning across a
wide range of models and domains and exhibits an intrinsic robustness to
overfitting when data in the new domain is scarce and down to as little as 500
samples.
  Employing corrective self-distillation that is individualized on the sample
level, MFT outperforms parameter-efficient finetuning methods, demonstrates
replay-like degeneralization mitigation properties, and is composable with
either for a combined effect.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦不完全多视图聚类方法FIMCFG，通过全局融合图指导解决现有方法在特征提取和缺失数据问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦多视图聚类方法仅使用全局伪标签指导聚类，未充分利用全局信息，且对缺失数据问题研究不足。

Method: 设计双头图卷积编码器提取全局和视图特定特征，在融合图指导下生成高级特征进行聚类，并通过伪标签监督优化。

Result: 实验证明FIMCFG在效果和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIMCFG有效解决了联邦多视图聚类中的全局信息利用和缺失数据问题，具有优越性。

Abstract: Federated multi-view clustering has been proposed to mine the valuable
information within multi-view data distributed across different devices and has
achieved impressive results while preserving the privacy. Despite great
progress, most federated multi-view clustering methods only used global
pseudo-labels to guide the downstream clustering process and failed to exploit
the global information when extracting features. In addition, missing data
problem in federated multi-view clustering task is less explored. To address
these problems, we propose a novel Federated Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
method with globally Fused Graph guidance (FIMCFG). Specifically, we designed a
dual-head graph convolutional encoder at each client to extract two kinds of
underlying features containing global and view-specific information.
Subsequently, under the guidance of the fused graph, the two underlying
features are fused into high-level features, based on which clustering is
conducted under the supervision of pseudo-labeling. Finally, the high-level
features are uploaded to the server to refine the graph fusion and
pseudo-labeling computation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of FIMCFG. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/PaddiHunter/FIMCFG.

*Feiyu Yao,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LFPS（Learn From the Past for Sparse Indexing）是一种通过利用历史注意力模式动态构建稀疏索引候选的加速方法，显著提升了长上下文LLM的解码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM支持更长的上下文，KV缓存的存储需求成为GPU内存和PCIe带宽的瓶颈。稀疏注意力机制虽能缓解问题，但其索引计算开销较大，且现有方法未充分利用历史解码信息。

Method: LFPS通过捕捉解码注意力的垂直模式和斜线模式，结合位置扩展策略，动态预测当前步骤的Top-k索引。

Result: 实验表明，LFPS在RTX 4090 GPU和Xeon Gold 6430 CPU上分别实现了22.8倍和9.6倍的加速，同时保持生成准确性。

Conclusion: LFPS为长上下文LLM推理提供了一种高效且实用的解码优化方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to support increasingly longer
contexts, the memory demand for key-value (KV) caches during decoding grows
rapidly, becoming a critical bottleneck in both GPU memory capacity and PCIe
bandwidth. Sparse attention mechanisms alleviate this issue by computing
attention weights only for selected key-value pairs. However, their indexing
computation typically requires traversing all key vectors, resulting in
significant computational and data transfer overhead. To reduce the cost of
index retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an
independent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in
historical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the
Past for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs
sparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns. LFPS
captures two prevalent trends in decoder attention -vertical patterns
(attending to fixed positions) and slash patterns (attending to relative
positions) -and incorporates a positional expansion strategy to effectively
predict the Top-k indices for the current step. We validate LFPS on challenging
long-context benchmarks such as LongBench-RULER, using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as
the base model. Experimental results show that LFPS achieves up to 22.8$\times$
speedup over full attention and 9.6$\times$ speedup over exact Top-k retrieval
on an RTX 4090 GPU and a single CPU core of a Xeon Gold 6430, respectively,
while preserving generation accuracy. These results demonstrate that LFPS
offers a practical and efficient solution for decoding optimization in
long-context LLM inference.

Motivation: 探索TSFMs在无需训练或定制的情况下预测宏观经济指标的潜力，为实践者提供零样本部署的指导。

Method: 在数据稀缺和结构断裂条件下，对三种先进TSFMs（Chronos、TimeGPT和Moirai）进行严格回测。

Result: TSFMs能内化经济动态、适应制度变化并提供不确定性估计，性能与多变量模型相当，但在快速冲击期表现下降。

Conclusion: TSFMs在稳定条件下无需微调即可媲美经典模型，但在快速冲击期需谨慎使用。

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series
Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to
forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need
for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our
experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional
customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos,
TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our
results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich
economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved
uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art
multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any
fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic
conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during
periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when
zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法在长链数学推理中效果有限，难以有效捕捉偏好数据中的差异，且训练目标与生成指标不一致。

Method: 提出MDPO方法，在Solution2Solution、Inference2Inference和Step2Step三个粒度上优化LLMs的数学推理能力，并统一训练目标。

Result: 在Qwen2和Llama3模型上，GSM8K数据集提升1.7%和0.9%，MATH数据集提升2.3%和1.2%。

Conclusion: MDPO方法显著提升了LLMs的数学推理能力，且数据构建流程简单无需人工标注。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language
Models (LLMs) as it requires ensuring the correctness of each reasoning step.
Researchers have been strengthening the mathematical reasoning abilities of
LLMs through supervised fine-tuning, but due to the inability to suppress
incorrect outputs, illusions can easily arise. Recently, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has been widely adopted for aligning human intent by using
preference data to prevent LLMs from generating incorrect outputs. However, it
has shown limited benefits in long-chain mathematical reasoning, mainly because
DPO struggles to effectively capture the differences between accepted and
rejected answers from preferences in long-chain data. The inconsistency between
DPO training and LLMs' generation metrics also affects the effectiveness of
suppressing incorrect outputs. We propose the Multi-Granularity Direct
Preference Optimization (MDPO) method, optimizing the mathematical reasoning of
LLMs at three granularities: Solution2Solution, Inference2Inference, and
Step2Step. Solution2Solution focuses on the correctness of entire long-chain
reasoning; Inference2Inference concentrates on logical reasoning between steps;
Step2Step corrects computational errors in steps, enhancing the computational
capabilities of LLMs. Additionally, we unify the training objectives of the
three granularities to align with the generation metrics. We conducted
experiments on the open-source models Qwen2 and Llama3, achieving improvements
of 1.7% and 0.9% on the GSM8K dataset, and 2.3% and 1.2% on the MATH dataset,
outperforming DPO and other DPO variant methods. Furthermore, we also provide a
pipeline for constructing MDPO training data that is simple and does not
require manual annotation costs.

TL;DR: TTS通过搜索优化LLM性能，但现有方法在资源分配上效率不足。DORA提出方向级资源分配，实验证明其优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何高效分配固定推理预算以提升LLM性能，解决现有方法因候选数量偏置导致的资源浪费问题。

Method: 将测试时搜索建模为资源分配问题，提出DORA方法，通过方向级分配优化资源利用。

Result: 在MATH500等数学推理任务上，DORA以相同计算成本实现最优准确率。

Conclusion: DORA为LLM的测试时搜索提供了更优的资源分配策略，推动了TTS领域的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple
reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most
effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient
use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search
as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy
that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed
rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of
existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning
directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and
inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented
Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias
by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources
at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct
extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks
including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA
consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a
broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN框架未考虑大脑ROI间的因果关系，而因果关系比传统相关性更能揭示信号间的因果交互。

Result: CGB在脑疾病分类任务中优于现有方法，F1分数更高。

Conclusion: CGB通过建模因果关系和优化图结构，显著提升了脑疾病检测性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed to model the relationship
between regions of interest (ROIs) in brains and have shown significant
improvement in detecting brain diseases. However, most of these frameworks do
not consider the intrinsic relationship of causality factor between brain ROIs,
which is arguably more essential to observe cause and effect interaction
between signals rather than typical correlation values. We propose a novel
framework called CGB (Causal Graphs for Brains) for brain disease
classification/detection, which models refined brain networks based on the
causal discovery method, transfer entropy, and geometric curvature strategy.
CGB unveils causal relationships between ROIs that bring vital information to
enhance brain disease classification performance. Furthermore, CGB also
performs a graph rewiring through a geometric curvature strategy to refine the
generated causal graph to become more expressive and reduce potential
information bottlenecks when GNNs model it. Our extensive experiments show that
CGB outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification tasks on brain
disease datasets, as measured by average F1 scores.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种直接估计网络模体显著性谱（SP）的方法，避免了传统子图频率估计的限制，并通过多目标回归优化了可解释性、稳定性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）在网络模体SP预测方面缺乏研究，且无基准测试。论文旨在填补这一空白，将SP估计独立于子图频率估计。

Method: 将SP估计重新定义为多目标回归问题，直接估计SP而非依赖子图频率计数，优化了可解释性和可扩展性。

Result: 实验表明，1-WL受限模型难以精确估计SP，但能通过比较预测SP与合成生成器的SP，近似网络生成过程。

Conclusion: 直接SP估计有助于突破子图计数在模体估计中的理论限制，为GNN在模体分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph
representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their
application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains
under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to
address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph
frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP
estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The
reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on
large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and
further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited
models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can
generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by
comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic
generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how
using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that
motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.

Motivation: 大规模RL训练资源消耗高，且RL主要调整输出分布而非增加新知识。假设RL诱导的概率变化与模型规模无关，可从小模型转移到大模型。

Method: 提出RAST方法，分析RL诱导的输出分布一致性，将小模型的概率调整注入大模型。

Result: 实验表明RAST显著提升大模型推理能力，计算成本更低，有时性能优于直接RL训练。

Conclusion: RAST揭示了RL驱动推理的本质，提供了一种高效扩展RL优势的实用策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful approach for improving the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent
successes such as OpenAI's o1 and Deepseek-R1. However, applying RL at scale
remains intimidatingly resource-intensive, requiring multiple model copies and
extensive GPU workloads. On the other hand, while being powerful, recent
studies suggest that RL does not fundamentally endow models with new knowledge;
rather, it primarily reshapes the model's output distribution to activate
reasoning capabilities latent in the base model. Building on this insight, we
hypothesize that the changes in output probabilities induced by RL are largely
model-size invariant, opening the door to a more efficient paradigm: training a
small model with RL and transferring its induced probability shifts to larger
base models. To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of
decoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output
distributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by
this, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning
behaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small
RL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the
reasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU
memory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than
the RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of
RL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without
incurring its full computational cost. The project page of RAST is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私保护分布式训练中具有潜力，但梯度反转攻击可能泄露敏感数据。现有防御方法缺乏针对性，导致隐私保护与模型性能的失衡。

Method: 利用具有可解释性的影子模型识别敏感区域，实现样本特定的噪声注入。

Result: 在ChestXRay和EyePACS数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于无防御情况，且模型性能损失小于1%。

Conclusion: 该框架在多种医疗图像上验证了其通用性，能稳定提升防御效果，并适用于多种梯度反转攻击类型。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative framework for
privacy-preserving distributed training, allowing clients to collaboratively
train a global model without sharing their local data. This is especially
crucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is
paramount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the
communication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.
Gradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to
approximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,
thus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,
yet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image
information are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate
calibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection
degrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive
information. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these
challenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying
sensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise
injection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in
PSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the
ChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,
it minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\% F1
reduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across
diverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed
framework. The stable defense improvements for FedAvg are consistently over
1.5\% times in LPIPS and SSIM. It also offers a universal defense against
various GIA types, especially for these sensitive areas in images.

Conclusion: 验证了BERT风格预训练在时间序列故障检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate fault detection in lithium-ion batteries is essential for the safe
and reliable operation of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal
dependencies and cannot fully leverage abundant unlabeled data. Although large
language models (LLMs) exhibit strong representation capabilities, their
architectures are not directly suited to the numerical time-series data common
in industrial settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that adapts BERT-style pretraining for battery fault detection by
extending the standard BERT architecture with a customized time-series-to-token
representation module and a point-level Masked Signal Modeling (point-MSM)
pretraining task tailored to battery applications. This approach enables
self-supervised learning on sequential current, voltage, and other
charge-discharge cycle data, yielding distributionally robust, context-aware
temporal embeddings. We then concatenate these embeddings with battery metadata
and feed them into a downstream classifier for accurate fault classification.
Experimental results on a large-scale real-world dataset show that models
initialized with our pretrained parameters significantly improve both
representation quality and classification accuracy, achieving an AUROC of 0.945
and substantially outperforming existing approaches. These findings validate
the effectiveness of BERT-style pretraining for time-series fault detection.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of floating offshore asset behavior under stochastic
metocean conditions remains a significant challenge in offshore engineering.
While traditional empirical and frequency-domain methods work well in benign
conditions, they struggle with both extreme sea states and nonlinear responses.
This study presents a supervised machine learning approach using multivariate
regression to predict the nonlinear motion response of a turret-moored vessel
in 400 m water depth. We developed a machine learning workflow combining a
gradient-boosted ensemble method with a custom passive weathervaning solver,
trained on approximately $10^6$ samples spanning 100 features. The model
achieved mean prediction errors of less than 5% for critical mooring parameters
and vessel heading accuracy to within 2.5 degrees across diverse metocean
conditions, significantly outperforming traditional frequency-domain methods.
The framework has been successfully deployed on an operational facility,
demonstrating its efficacy for real-time vessel monitoring and operational
decision-making in offshore environments.

Motivation: 传统自注意力在长序列建模中存在计算瓶颈，STLT通过可学习参数和自适应节点分配，提供了一种更高效且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 引入可训练的拉普拉斯节点参数，结合快速递归卷积和FFT计算，动态调整节点数量和衰减率。

Conclusion: STLT结合了可解释性、可扩展性和鲁棒性，为超长序列语言建模提供了一种新途径。

Abstract: We propose an innovative, learnable two-sided short-time Laplace transform
(STLT) mechanism to supplant the traditional self attention in
transformer-based LLMs. Our STLT introduces trainable parameters for each
Laplace node, enabling end-to-end learning of decay rates , oscillatory
frequencies, and window bandwidth T. This flexibility allows the model to
dynamically adapt token relevance half lives and frequency responses during
training. By selecting S learnable nodes and leveraging fast recursive
convolution, we achieve an effective complexity of in time and memory. We
further incorporate an efficient FFT-based computation of the relevance matrix
and an adaptive node allocation mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of
active Laplace nodes. Empirical results on language modeling (WikiText\-103,
Project Gutenberg), machine translation (WMT'14 En\-De), and long document
question answering (NarrativeQA) demonstrate that our learnable STLT achieves
perplexities and scores on par with or better than existing efficient
transformers while naturally extending to context lengths exceeding 100k tokens
or more limited only by available hardware. Ablation studies confirm the
importance of learnable parameters and adaptive node allocation. The proposed
approach combines interpretability, through explicit decay and frequency
parameters, with scalability and robustness, offering a pathway towards
ultra-long-sequence language modeling without the computational bottleneck of
self-attention.

Conclusion: NeuronSeek-TD为神经元优化提供了数学基础和实用框架，性能优越。

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from our human brain that designs different neurons for
different tasks, recent advances in deep learning have explored modifying a
network's neurons to develop so-called task-driven neurons. Prototyping
task-driven neurons (referred to as NeuronSeek) employs symbolic regression
(SR) to discover the optimal neuron formulation and construct a network from
these optimized neurons. Along this direction, this work replaces symbolic
regression with tensor decomposition (TD) to discover optimal neuronal
formulations, offering enhanced stability and faster convergence. Furthermore,
we establish theoretical guarantees that modifying the aggregation functions
with common activation functions can empower a network with a fixed number of
parameters to approximate any continuous function with an arbitrarily small
error, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for the NeuronSeek
framework. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our NeuronSeek-TD
framework not only achieves superior stability, but also is competitive
relative to the state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks. The code is

Result: 理论分析提供了样本复杂性和错误估计退出概率时的损失边界。实证结果显示，该方法显著提高了代表性且需要更少的替补成员。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了公民集会中的不平衡问题，提升了代表性，同时减少了替补成员的需求。

Abstract: An increasingly influential form of deliberative democracy centers on
citizens' assemblies, where randomly selected people discuss policy questions.
The legitimacy of these panels hinges on their representation of the broader
population, but panelists often drop out, leading to an unbalanced composition.
Although participant attrition is mitigated in practice by alternates, their
selection is not taken into account by existing methods. To address this gap,
we introduce an optimization framework for alternate selection. Our algorithmic
approach, which leverages learning-theoretic machinery, estimates dropout
probabilities using historical data and selects alternates to minimize expected
misrepresentation. We establish theoretical guarantees for our approach,
including worst-case bounds on sample complexity (with implications for
computational efficiency) and on loss when panelists' probabilities of dropping
out are mis-estimated. Empirical evaluation using real-world data demonstrates
that, compared to the status quo, our method significantly improves
representation while requiring fewer alternates.

Result: daDPO在修剪模型和小型模型上表现优异，例如使修剪后的Vicuna1.5-7B接近教师性能，Qwen2.5-1.5B甚至偶尔超越7B教师模型。

Conclusion: daDPO是一种高效的方法，能够显著提升小型语言模型的性能，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
various applications, but their conversational abilities decline sharply as
model size decreases, presenting a barrier to their deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation with Direct
Preference Optimization (dDPO) has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
the conversational abilities of smaller models using a larger teacher model.
However, current methods primarily focus on 'black-box' KD, which only uses the
teacher's responses, overlooking the output distribution offered by the
teacher. This paper addresses this gap by introducing daDPO (Distribution-Aware
DPO), a unified method for preference optimization and distribution-based
distillation. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical
validation, showing that daDPO outperforms existing methods in restoring
performance for pruned models and enhancing smaller LLM models. Notably, in
in-domain evaluation, our method enables a 20% pruned Vicuna1.5-7B to achieve
near-teacher performance (-7.3% preference rate compared to that of dDPO's
-31%), and allows Qwen2.5-1.5B to occasionally outperform its 7B teacher model
(14.0% win rate).

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence, the automatic generation of
building-scale 3-D objects has become an active research topic, yet training
such models still demands large, clean and richly annotated datasets. We
introduce BuildingBRep-11K, a collection of 11 978 multi-storey (2-10 floors)
buildings (about 10 GB) produced by a shape-grammar-driven pipeline that
encodes established building-design principles. Every sample consists of a
geometrically exact B-rep solid-covering floors, walls, slabs and rule-based
openings-together with a fast-loading .npy metadata file that records detailed
per-floor parameters. The generator incorporates constraints on spatial scale,
daylight optimisation and interior layout, and the resulting objects pass
multi-stage filters that remove Boolean failures, undersized rooms and extreme
aspect ratios, ensuring compliance with architectural standards. To verify the
dataset's learnability we trained two lightweight PointNet baselines. (i)
Multi-attribute regression. A single encoder predicts storey count, total
rooms, per-storey vector and mean room area from a 4 000-point cloud. On 100
unseen buildings it attains 0.37-storey MAE (87 \% within $\pm1$), 5.7-room
MAE, and 3.2 m$^2$ MAE on mean area. (ii) Defect detection. With the same
backbone we classify GOOD versus DEFECT; on a balanced 100-model set the
network reaches 54 \% accuracy, recalling 82 \% of true defects at 53 \%
precision (41 TP, 9 FN, 37 FP, 13 TN). These pilots show that BuildingBRep-11K
is learnable yet non-trivial for both geometric regression and topological
quality assessment

Abstract: Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for
sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains
restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine
learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications,
optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines
predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production
strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key
contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation
forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer
responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced
time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and
tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention
mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4)

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的少样本类增量学习方法（Tri-WE），通过权重空间集成和知识蒸馏解决灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定特征提取器限制了模型对新类的适应性，因此需要一种方法能够更新整个模型并保持旧知识。

Method: 使用Tri-WE在权重空间集成基础、前一个和当前模型，并通过放大数据知识蒸馏正则化损失。

Result: 在miniImageNet、CUB200和CIFAR100数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Tri-WE方法有效解决了少样本类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) enables the continual learning of
new concepts with only a few training examples. In FSCIL, the model undergoes
substantial updates, making it prone to forgetting previous concepts and
overfitting to the limited new examples. Most recent trend is typically to
disentangle the learning of the representation from the classification head of
the model. A well-generalized feature extractor on the base classes (many
examples and many classes) is learned, and then fixed during incremental
learning. Arguing that the fixed feature extractor restricts the model's
adaptability to new classes, we introduce a novel FSCIL method to effectively
address catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. Our method enables to
seamlessly update the entire model with a few examples. We mainly propose a
tripartite weight-space ensemble (Tri-WE). Tri-WE interpolates the base,
immediately previous, and current models in weight-space, especially for the
classification heads of the models. Then, it collaboratively maintains
knowledge from the base and previous models. In addition, we recognize the
challenges of distilling generalized representations from the previous model
from scarce data. Hence, we suggest a regularization loss term using amplified
data knowledge distillation. Simply intermixing the few-shot data, we can
produce richer data enabling the distillation of critical knowledge from the
previous model. Consequently, we attain state-of-the-art results on the
miniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 datasets.

TL;DR: Bohdi框架通过合成数据和动态调整解决了异构大语言模型融合中的领域限制和能力不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限领域的真实数据且固定数据分配比例，导致目标模型无法全面获取多领域知识且能力不平衡。

Method: Bohdi采用合成数据框架，通过知识树和多模型协作实现自动领域探索和数据生成，并利用分层多臂老虎机问题动态调整数据采样比例。

Result: 实验表明Bohdi在多个基准测试中显著优于基线方法，数据效率更高且消除了能力不平衡。

Conclusion: Bohdi通过动态调整和合成数据有效解决了异构LLM融合的局限性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) fusion integrates the strengths of
multiple source LLMs with different architectures into a target LLM with low
computational overhead. While promising, existing methods suffer from two major
limitations: 1) reliance on real data from limited domain for knowledge fusion,
preventing the target LLM from fully acquiring knowledge across diverse
domains, and 2) fixed data allocation proportions across domains, failing to
dynamically adjust according to the target LLM's varying capabilities across
domains, leading to a capability imbalance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bohdi, a synthetic-data-only heterogeneous LLM fusion framework.
Through the organization of knowledge domains into a hierarchical tree
structure, Bohdi enables automatic domain exploration and multi-domain data
generation through multi-model collaboration, thereby comprehensively
extracting knowledge from source LLMs. By formalizing domain expansion and data
sampling proportion allocation on the knowledge tree as a Hierarchical
Multi-Armed Bandit problem, Bohdi leverages the designed DynaBranches mechanism
to adaptively adjust sampling proportions based on the target LLM's performance
feedback across domains. Integrated with our proposed Introspection-Rebirth
(IR) mechanism, DynaBranches dynamically tracks capability shifts during target
LLM's updates via Sliding Window Binomial Likelihood Ratio Testing (SWBLRT),
further enhancing its online adaptation capability. Comparative experimental
results on a comprehensive suite of benchmarks demonstrate that Bohdi
significantly outperforms existing baselines on multiple target LLMs, exhibits
higher data efficiency, and virtually eliminates the imbalance in the target
LLM's capabilities. Our code is available at
https://github.com/gjq100/Bohdi.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNIMATE的统一模型，用于同时处理机械超材料设计中的3D拓扑、密度条件和力学性能三种模态，填补了现有研究仅考虑两种模态的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多仅考虑机械超材料设计中的两种模态（如3D拓扑或力学性能），而实际复杂应用场景需要同时处理三种模态，因此需要一种更全面的模型。

Method: UNIMATE模型包含模态对齐模块和协同扩散生成模块，能够同时处理3D拓扑、密度条件和力学性能三种模态。

Result: 实验表明，UNIMATE在拓扑生成、性能预测和条件确认任务中分别优于基线模型80.2%、5.1%和50.2%。

Conclusion: UNIMATE填补了现有研究的空白，并在多个任务中表现出色，已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: Metamaterials are artificial materials that are designed to meet unseen
properties in nature, such as ultra-stiffness and negative materials indices.
In mechanical metamaterial design, three key modalities are typically involved,
i.e., 3D topology, density condition, and mechanical property. Real-world
complex application scenarios place the demanding requirements on machine
learning models to consider all three modalities together. However, a
comprehensive literature review indicates that most existing works only
consider two modalities, e.g., predicting mechanical properties given the 3D
topology or generating 3D topology given the required properties. Therefore,
there is still a significant gap for the state-of-the-art machine learning
models capturing the whole. Hence, we propose a unified model named UNIMATE,
which consists of a modality alignment module and a synergetic diffusion
generation module. Experiments indicate that UNIMATE outperforms the other
baseline models in topology generation task, property prediction task, and
condition confirmation task by up to 80.2%, 5.1%, and 50.2%, respectively. We
opensource our proposed UNIMATE model and corresponding results at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MadaKV是一种模态自适应的KV缓存淘汰策略，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长上下文推理中的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态场景中，注意力头对不同模态的偏好差异显著，传统单模态KV缓存淘汰方法无法捕捉模态特异性信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: MadaKV通过模态偏好适应和分层压缩补偿两个关键组件，动态感知注意力头中的模态信息并自适应保留关键令牌。

Result: 实验表明，MadaKV显著减少了KV缓存内存占用和模型推理延迟（提升1.3至1.5倍），同时在多模态长上下文任务中保持高准确率。

Conclusion: MadaKV在MileBench基准测试中表现优于现有KV缓存淘汰方法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces MadaKV, a modality-adaptive key-value (KV) cache
eviction strategy designed to enhance the efficiency of multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) in long-context inference. In multimodal scenarios,
attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting
in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads.
Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal
settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding
suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key
components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression
compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention
heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial
reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency
(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various
multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs
and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to
existing KV cache eviction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的图生成模型无法在扩散过程中调整图的大小，限制了其在条件生成（如属性驱动分子设计）中的应用。

Method: 重新设计噪声和去噪过程，支持节点的单调插入和删除，提出GrIDDD模型。

Result: GrIDDD在分子属性定向生成任务中表现优于现有模型，并在分子优化中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: GrIDDD为尺寸自适应的分子生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular
generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom
and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited
by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms)
during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in
conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design,
where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this
paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic
insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD,
dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD
matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on
molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem.
Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits
competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work
paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.

Motivation: 快速准确地预测分子性质对科学进步至关重要，传统方法依赖噪声数据或有偏模拟，而CheMeleon利用低噪声分子描述符提供更优解决方案。

Method: 使用Mordred包中的确定性分子描述符预训练，采用定向消息传递神经网络（D-MPNN）预测描述符，避免噪声干扰。

Result: 在Polaris和MoleculeACE基准测试中，CheMeleon分别以79%和97%的胜率超越基线模型，但在活性悬崖区分上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 基于描述符的预训练为分子性质预测提供了可扩展且高效的途径，未来可探索更多描述符集和未标记数据集。

Abstract: Fast and accurate prediction of molecular properties with machine learning is
pivotal to scientific advancements across myriad domains. Foundation models in
particular have proven especially effective, enabling accurate training on
small, real-world datasets. This study introduces CheMeleon, a novel molecular
foundation model pre-trained on deterministic molecular descriptors from the
Mordred package, leveraging a Directed Message-Passing Neural Network to
predict these descriptors in a noise-free setting. Unlike conventional
approaches relying on noisy experimental data or biased quantum mechanical
simulations, CheMeleon uses low-noise molecular descriptors to learn rich
molecular representations. Evaluated on 58 benchmark datasets from Polaris and
MoleculeACE, CheMeleon achieves a win rate of 79% on Polaris tasks,
outperforming baselines like Random Forest (46%), fastprop (39%), and Chemprop
(36%), and a 97% win rate on MoleculeACE assays, surpassing Random Forest (63%)
and other foundation models. However, it struggles to distinguish activity
cliffs like many of the tested models. The t-SNE projection of CheMeleon's
learned representations demonstrates effective separation of chemical series,
highlighting its ability to capture structural nuances. These results
underscore the potential of descriptor-based pre-training for scalable and
effective molecular property prediction, opening avenues for further
exploration of descriptor sets and unlabeled datasets.

Result: DeepJ能识别与患者预后相关的关键事件群，性能显著优于五种基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepJ在患者风险分层中具有潜力，同时提高了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling
complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a
static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or
collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when
it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning
longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling
interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To
address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel
graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to
effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event
interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related
medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to
patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five
state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability,
demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式环境中模型融合的挑战，并推广到异构环境下的强化学习问题。

Method: 将数据集分发给多个代理，各自训练本地DNN，通过Wasserstein质心聚合权重；在HFRL中，通过全局聚合泛化本地DQN模型。

Result: 在CartPole问题中验证了FedWB和HFRL算法的有效性，生成了适用于所有环境的全局DQN。

Conclusion: FedWB和HFRL为分布式和异构环境下的模型融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a novel algorithm for model fusion that
leverages Wasserstein barycenters in training a global Deep Neural Network
(DNN) in a distributed architecture. To this end, we divide the dataset into
equal parts that are fed to "agents" who have identical deep neural networks
and train only over the dataset fed to them (known as the local dataset). After
some training iterations, we perform an aggregation step where we combine the
weight parameters of all neural networks using Wasserstein barycenters. These
steps form the proposed algorithm referred to as FedWB. Moreover, we leverage
the processes created in the first part of the paper to develop an algorithm to
tackle Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning (HFRL). Our test
experiment is the CartPole toy problem, where we vary the lengths of the poles
to create heterogeneous environments. We train a deep Q-Network (DQN) in each
environment to learn to control each cart, while occasionally performing a
global aggregation step to generalize the local models; the end outcome is a
global DQN that functions across all environments.

Result: 该方法提高了传感器数据的泛化能力，适用于不同地理位置。

Conclusion: 通过集成学习方法校准低成本传感器，能够有效提升空气质量监测的覆盖范围和准确性。

Abstract: Effective large-scale air quality monitoring necessitates distributed sensing
due to the pervasive and harmful nature of particulate matter (PM),
particularly in urban environments. However, precision comes at a cost: highly
accurate sensors are expensive, limiting the spatial deployments and thus their
coverage. As a result, low-cost sensors have become popular, though they are
prone to drift caused by environmental sensitivity and manufacturing
variability. This paper presents a model for in-field sensor calibration using
XGBoost ensemble learning to consolidate data from neighboring sensors. This
approach reduces dependence on the presumed accuracy of individual sensors and
improves generalization across different locations.

Conclusion: 模型与人类不确定性存在差距，利用人类洞察可提升AI系统的可信度。

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often achieve high predictive accuracy but
remain poorly calibrated, producing overconfident predictions even when wrong.
This miscalibration poses serious challenges in applications where reliable
uncertainty estimates are critical. In this work, we investigate how human
perceptual uncertainty compares to uncertainty estimated by NNs. Using three
vision benchmarks annotated with both human disagreement and crowdsourced
confidence, we assess the correlation between model-predicted uncertainty and
human-perceived uncertainty. Our results show that current methods only weakly
align with human intuition, with correlations varying significantly across
tasks and uncertainty metrics. Notably, we find that incorporating
human-derived soft labels into the training process can improve calibration
without compromising accuracy. These findings reveal a persistent gap between
model and human uncertainty and highlight the potential of leveraging human
insights to guide the development of more trustworthy AI systems.

<details>

Motivation: 原始Rectified Flow模型直接建模速度场时，未约束的神经网络无法满足边界条件，导致速度场估计不准确，尤其在边界附近误差放大。

Method: 提出Boundary RF Model，通过最小代码修改强制边界条件。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ODE采样FID分数提升8.01%，SDE采样提升8.98%。

Conclusion: Boundary RF Model通过简单修改有效解决了边界条件问题，显著提升了生成模型性能。

Abstract: Rectified Flow offers a simple and effective approach to high-quality
generative modeling by learning a velocity field. However, we identify a
limitation in directly modeling the velocity with an unconstrained neural
network: the learned velocity often fails to satisfy certain boundary
conditions, leading to inaccurate velocity field estimations that deviate from
the desired ODE. This issue is particularly critical during stochastic sampling
at inference, as the score function's errors are amplified near the boundary.
To mitigate this, we propose a Boundary-enforced Rectified Flow Model (Boundary
RF Model), in which we enforce boundary conditions with a minimal code
modification. Boundary RF Model improves performance over vanilla RF model,
demonstrating 8.01% improvement in FID score on ImageNet using ODE sampling and
8.98% improvement using SDE sampling.

Result: 在合成算术和自然语言任务中验证，POLCA成功识别出可解释的模型能力突破。

Conclusion: POLCA为无监督可解释性提供了新工具，揭示了训练中的隐藏相变。

Abstract: Loss curves are smooth during most of model training, so visible
discontinuities stand out as possible conceptual breakthroughs. Studying these
breakthroughs enables a deeper understanding of learning dynamics, but only
when they are properly identified. This paper argues that similar breakthroughs
occur frequently throughout training but they are obscured by a loss metric
that collapses all variation into a single scalar. To find these hidden
transitions, we introduce POLCA, a method for decomposing changes in loss along
arbitrary bases of the low-rank training subspace. We use our method to
identify clusters of samples that share similar changes in loss during
training, disaggregating the overall loss into that of smaller groups of
conceptually similar data. We validate our method on synthetic arithmetic and
natural language tasks, showing that POLCA recovers clusters that represent
interpretable breakthroughs in the model's capabilities. We demonstrate the
promise of these hidden phase transitions as a tool for unsupervised
interpretability.

the key features influencing job market dynamics and provide valuable insights
for job seekers, employers, and researchers. Exploratory data analysis was
conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics. Subsequently, regression
models were developed to predict salaries, classification models to predict job
titles, and clustering techniques were applied to group similar jobs. The
analyses revealed significant factors influencing salary and job roles, and
identified distinct job clusters based on the provided data. While the results
are based on synthetic data and not intended for real-world deployment, the
methodology demonstrates a transferable framework for job market analysis.

Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) are effective for system identification
and forecasting from sparse sensor measurements. Such models are light-weight
and computationally efficient, allowing them to be trained on consumer laptops.
SHRED-based models rely on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the temporal encoding and spatial decoding
respectively. Despite the relatively simple structure of SHRED, they are able
to predict chaotic dynamical systems on different physical, spatial, and
temporal scales directly from a sparse set of sensor measurements. In this
work, we improve SHRED by leveraging transformers (T-SHRED) for the temporal
encoding which improves performance on next-step state prediction on large
datasets. We also introduce a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) attention mechanism into T-SHRED to perform symbolic regression
directly on the latent space as part of the model regularization architecture.
Symbolic regression improves model interpretability by learning and
regularizing the dynamics of the latent space during training. We analyze the
performance of T-SHRED on three different dynamical systems ranging from
low-data to high-data regimes. We observe that SINDy attention T-SHRED
accurately predicts future frames based on an interpretable symbolic model
across all tested datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和自反思在推理时对所有输入采用统一方式，忽略了不同问题需要不同推理深度。

Method: 提取与深度推理相关的潜在导向向量，并通过可调缩放因子重新应用，实现推理强度的动态控制。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH500和GPQA等任务上，Fractional Reasoning显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Fractional Reasoning为LLM提供了更灵活的推理控制，适用于多种推理任务和模型。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs
or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However,
existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically
apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that
different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this
work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic
framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference
time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method
operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper
reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports
two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in
breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing
the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g.,
self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that
Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning
tasks and models.

Result: 揭示了对比样本学习与自导学习经典模型之间的联系。

Conclusion: 对比样本的选择显著影响学习效率，为机器学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Machine learning can greatly benefit from providing learning algorithms with
pairs of contrastive training examples -- typically pairs of instances that
differ only slightly, yet have different class labels. Intuitively, the
difference in the instances helps explain the difference in the class labels.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework in which the effect of various
types of contrastive examples on active learners is studied formally. The focus
is on the sample complexity of learning concept classes and how it is
influenced by the choice of contrastive examples. We illustrate our results
with geometric concept classes and classes of Boolean functions. Interestingly,
we reveal a connection between learning from contrastive examples and the
classical model of self-directed learning.

Abstract: Precision soil greenhouse gas (GHG) flux prediction is essential in
agricultural systems for assessing environmental impacts, developing emission
mitigation strategies and promoting sustainable agriculture. Due to the lack of
advanced sensor and network technologies on majority of farms, there are
challenges in obtaining comprehensive and diverse agricultural data. As a
result, the scarcity of agricultural data seriously obstructs the application
of machine learning approaches in precision soil GHG flux prediction. This
research proposes a knowledge-guided graph neural network framework that
addresses the above challenges by integrating knowledge embedded in an
agricultural process-based model and graph neural network techniques.
Specifically, we utilise the agricultural process-based model to simulate and
generate multi-dimensional agricultural datasets for 47 countries that cover a
wide range of agricultural variables. To extract key agricultural features and
integrate correlations among agricultural features in the prediction process,
we propose a machine learning framework that integrates the autoencoder and
multi-target multi-graph based graph neural networks, which utilises the
autoencoder to selectively extract significant agricultural features from the
agricultural process-based model simulation data and the graph neural network
to integrate correlations among agricultural features for accurately predict
fertilisation-oriented soil GHG fluxes. Comprehensive experiments were
conducted with both the agricultural simulation dataset and real-world
agricultural dataset to evaluate the proposed approach in comparison with
well-known baseline and state-of-the-art regression methods. The results
demonstrate that our proposed approach provides superior accuracy and stability
in fertilisation-oriented soil GHG prediction.

Motivation: 随着定位技术的普及，大量轨迹数据被收集，但现有学习方法在语义差异、噪声和全局排序信息利用方面存在不足。

Method: TrajDiff框架包含语义对齐模块、基于DDBM的噪声鲁棒预训练和全局排序感知正则化。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，TrajDiff显著优于现有方法，平均HR@1提升33.38%。

Conclusion: TrajDiff通过语义对齐、噪声鲁棒性和全局排序优化，有效提升了轨迹相似性计算的性能。

Abstract: With the proliferation of location-tracking technologies, massive volumes of
trajectory data are continuously being collected. As a fundamental task in
trajectory data mining, trajectory similarity computation plays a critical role
in a wide range of real-world applications. However, existing learning-based
methods face three challenges: First, they ignore the semantic gap between GPS
and grid features in trajectories, making it difficult to obtain meaningful
trajectory embeddings. Second, the noise inherent in the trajectories, as well
as the noise introduced during grid discretization, obscures the true motion
patterns of the trajectories. Third, existing methods focus solely on
point-wise and pair-wise losses, without utilizing the global ranking
information obtained by sorting all trajectories according to their similarity
to a given trajectory. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a
novel trajectory similarity computation framework, named TrajDiff.
Specifically, the semantic alignment module relies on cross-attention and an
attention score mask mechanism with adaptive fusion, effectively eliminating
semantic discrepancies between data at two scales and generating a unified
representation. Additionally, the DDBM-based Noise-robust Pre-Training
introduces the transfer patterns between any two trajectories into the model
training process, enhancing the model's noise robustness. Finally, the overall
ranking-aware regularization shifts the model's focus from a local to a global
perspective, enabling it to capture the holistic ordering information among
trajectories. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets show
that TrajDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In
particular, it achieves an average HR@1 gain of 33.38% across all three
evaluation metrics and datasets.

CI: 0.779-0.867), surpassing more complex models. Key predictors included RAS,
age, bilirubin, and extubation. ALE plots showed intuitive, non-linear effects
such as age-related risk acceleration and bilirubin thresholds.
  Conclusion: This interpretable ML model offers accurate risk prediction and
clinical insights for early ICU triage in patients with DM and AF.

Abstract: Accurate graph similarity is critical for knowledge transfer in VLSI design,

Conclusion: 早期编码阶段的稀疏化可显著加速语音转录，无需微调。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural speech processing has achieved state-of-the-art
performance. Since speech audio signals are known to be highly compressible,
here we seek to accelerate neural speech transcription by time-domain signal
sparsification early in the neural encoding stage, taking advantage of the
interpretability of the self-attention mechanism in transformer audio encoders.
With the Whisper family of models, we perform a systematic architecture search
over the joint space of sparsification stage (a certain encoder layer) and
compression ratio (sparsity). We found that the best resulting solutions under
1% accuracy degradation choose to sparsify the hidden state to 40-60% sparsity
at an early encoding stage, and thereby achieve up to 1.6x runtime acceleration
in English speech transcription tasks on Nvidia GPUs without any fine-tuning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging
diverse datasets from multiple sources while preserving data privacy by

for the intricate gradient correlations between remote clients, a limitation
that becomes especially problematic in data heterogeneity scenarios. In this
work, we propose a novel FL framework utilizing Power-Norm Cosine Similarity
(PNCS) to improve client selection for model aggregation. By capturing
higher-order gradient moments, PNCS addresses non-IID data challenges,
enhancing convergence speed and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a simple
algorithm ensuring diverse client selection through a selection history queue.
Experiments with a VGG16 model across varied data partitions demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We study bandit learning in matching markets with two-sided reward
uncertainty, extending prior research primarily focused on single-sided
uncertainty. Leveraging the concept of `super-stability' from Irving (1994), we
demonstrate the advantage of the Extended Gale-Shapley (GS) algorithm over the
standard GS algorithm in achieving true stable matchings under incomplete
information. By employing the Extended GS algorithm, our centralized algorithm
attains a logarithmic pessimal stable regret dependent on an instance-dependent
admissible gap parameter. This algorithm is further adapted to a decentralized
setting with a constant regret increase. Finally, we establish a novel
centralized instance-dependent lower bound for binary stable regret,
elucidating the roles of the admissible gap and super-stable matching in
characterizing the complexity of stable matching with bandit feedback.

Conclusion: CORAL通过对比潜在对齐有效解决了长尾分布下扩散模型的尾类生成问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in generating
high-quality and diverse synthetic data. However, their success typically
assumes a class-balanced training distribution. In real-world settings,
multi-class data often follow a long-tailed distribution, where standard
diffusion models struggle -- producing low-diversity and lower-quality samples
for tail classes. While this degradation is well-documented, its underlying
cause remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the behavior of
diffusion models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify a key issue: the
latent representations (from the bottleneck layer of the U-Net) for tail class
subspaces exhibit significant overlap with those of head classes, leading to
feature borrowing and poor generation quality. Importantly, we show that this
is not merely due to limited data per class, but that the relative class
imbalance significantly contributes to this phenomenon. To address this, we
propose COntrastive Regularization for Aligning Latents (CORAL), a contrastive
latent alignment framework that leverages supervised contrastive losses to
encourage well-separated latent class representations. Experiments demonstrate
that CORAL significantly improves both the diversity and visual quality of
samples generated for tail classes relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stochastic linear bandits are a fundamental model for sequential decision
making, where an agent selects a vector-valued action and receives a noisy
reward with expected value given by an unknown linear function. Although well
studied in the single-agent setting, many real-world scenarios involve multiple
agents solving heterogeneous bandit problems, each with a different unknown
parameter. Applying single agent algorithms independently ignores cross-agent
similarity and learning opportunities. This paper investigates the optimal
regret achievable in collaborative personalized linear bandits. We provide an
information-theoretic lower bound that characterizes how the number of agents,
the interaction rounds, and the degree of heterogeneity jointly affect regret.
We then propose a new two-stage collaborative algorithm that achieves the
optimal regret. Our analysis models heterogeneity via a hierarchical Bayesian
framework and introduces a novel information-theoretic technique for bounding
regret. Our results offer a complete characterization of when and how
collaboration helps with a optimal regret bound $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{mn})$,
$\tilde{O}(dm^{1-\gamma}\sqrt{n})$, $\tilde{O}(dm\sqrt{n})$ for the number of
rounds $n$ in the range of $(0, \frac{d}{m \sigma^2})$, $[\frac{d}{m^{2\gamma}
\sigma^2}, \frac{d}{\sigma^2}]$ and $(\frac{d}{\sigma^2}, \infty)$
respectively, where $\sigma$ measures the level of heterogeneity, $m$ is the
number of agents, and $\gamma\in[0, 1/2]$ is an absolute constant. In contrast,
agents without collaboration achieve a regret bound $O(dm\sqrt{n})$ at best.

Abstract: Critical Learning Periods comprehend an important phenomenon involving deep
learning, where early epochs play a decisive role in the success of many
training recipes, such as data augmentation. Existing works confirm the
existence of this phenomenon and provide useful insights. However, the
literature lacks efforts to precisely identify when critical periods occur. In
this work, we fill this gap by introducing a systematic approach for
identifying critical periods during the training of deep neural networks,
focusing on eliminating computationally intensive regularization techniques and
effectively applying mechanisms for reducing computational costs, such as data
pruning. Our method leverages generalization prediction mechanisms to pinpoint
critical phases where training recipes yield maximum benefits to the predictive
ability of models. By halting resource-intensive recipes beyond these periods,
we significantly accelerate the learning phase and achieve reductions in
training time, energy consumption, and CO$_2$ emissions. Experiments on
standard architectures and benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method.
Specifically, we achieve significant milestones by reducing the training time
of popular architectures by up to 59.67%, leading to a 59.47% decrease in
CO$_2$ emissions and a 60% reduction in financial costs, without compromising
performance. Our work enhances understanding of training dynamics and paves the
way for more sustainable and efficient deep learning practices, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. In the era of the race for foundation
models, we believe our method emerges as a valuable framework. The repository

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful tool for interpreting
features learned by large language models (LLMs). It aims to recover complex
superposed polysemantic features into interpretable monosemantic ones through
feature reconstruction via sparsely activated neural networks. Despite the wide
applications of SAEs, it remains unclear under what conditions an SAE can fully
recover the ground truth monosemantic features from the superposed polysemantic
ones. In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we for the first time
propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiable SAEs (SAEs
that learn unique and ground truth monosemantic features), including 1) extreme
sparsity of the ground truth feature, 2) sparse activation of SAEs, and 3)
enough hidden dimensions of SAEs. Moreover, when the identifiable conditions
are not fully met, we propose a reweighting strategy to improve the
identifiability. Specifically, following the theoretically suggested weight
selection principle, we prove that the gap between the loss functions of SAE
reconstruction and monosemantic feature reconstruction can be narrowed, so that
the reweighted SAEs have better reconstruction of the ground truth monosemantic
features than the uniformly weighted ones. In experiments, we validate our
theoretical findings and show that our weighted SAE significantly improves
feature monosemanticity and interpretability.

Conclusion: 保留周期性关键令牌对多步推理任务的知识连续性至关重要，LazyEviction为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced reasoning capabilities by
employing Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the extended reasoning sequences
introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache
size, particularly in tasks requiring long reasoning sequences, such as
mathematics and programming. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate
memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we
analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance
Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens receive renewed attention
after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and
may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To
address this, we propose LazyEviction, a lagged KV eviction framework designed
to maintain reasoning performance while reducing KV memory. LazyEviction is an
Observation Window-based Lagged Eviction Mechanism retaining latent recurring
tokens by performing lagged evictions across decoding steps, which contains two
key components: (1) Recurrence Interval Tracking for capturing temporal
variations in token importance, and (2) an Maximum Recurrence Interval-Centric
Eviction Policy that prioritizes eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache size by
50% while maintaining comparable accuracy on mathematics reasoning datasets,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the importance
of preserving recurring tokens, which are critical for maintaining knowledge
continuity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Result: 在PEMS08上训练速度提升10.76倍，内存减少6.06倍，同时在96-720步范围内保持准确性。

Conclusion: AutoHFormer为高效精确的时间序列建模设定了新基准。

Abstract: Time series forecasting requires architectures that simultaneously achieve
three competing objectives: (1) strict temporal causality for reliable
predictions, (2) sub-quadratic complexity for practical scalability, and (3)
multi-scale pattern recognition for accurate long-horizon forecasting. We
introduce AutoHFormer, a hierarchical autoregressive transformer that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical Temporal
Modeling: Our architecture decomposes predictions into segment-level blocks
processed in parallel, followed by intra-segment sequential refinement. This
dual-scale approach maintains temporal coherence while enabling efficient
computation. 2) Dynamic Windowed Attention: The attention mechanism employs
learnable causal windows with exponential decay, reducing complexity while
preserving precise temporal relationships. This design avoids both the
anti-causal violations of standard transformers and the sequential bottlenecks
of RNN hybrids. 3) Adaptive Temporal Encoding: a novel position encoding system
is adopted to capture time patterns at multiple scales. It combines fixed
oscillating patterns for short-term variations with learnable decay rates for
long-term trends. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AutoHFormer 10.76X
faster training and 6.06X memory reduction compared to PatchTST on PEMS08,

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), powered by self-supervised learning (SSL), have
redefined the capabilities of artificial intelligence, demonstrating
exceptional performance in domains like natural language processing and
computer vision. These advances present a transformative opportunity for brain
signal analysis. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which is limited by
the scarcity of labeled neural data, SSL offers a promising solution by
enabling models to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. This
is particularly valuable in addressing the unique challenges of brain signals,
including high noise levels, inter-subject variability, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of bridging brain
signals with foundation models through the innovative application of SSL. It
explores key SSL techniques, the development of brain-specific foundation
models, their adaptation to downstream tasks, and the integration of brain
signals with other modalities in multimodal SSL frameworks. The review also
covers commonly used evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets that support
comparative analysis. Finally, it highlights key challenges and outlines future
research directions. This work aims to provide researchers with a structured
understanding of this rapidly evolving field and a roadmap for developing
generalizable brain foundation models powered by self-supervision.

TL;DR: VRAIL是一个基于向量化奖励的双层框架，用于强化学习，通过学习可解释的权重表示提升训练稳定性和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过可解释的权重表示和奖励变换，提升强化学习的训练效果和可解释性。

Method: VRAIL分为深度学习阶段（拟合价值函数）和强化学习阶段（通过奖励变换引导学习），支持线性和二次模型。

Result: 在Taxi-v3环境中，VRAIL相比标准DQN提升了训练稳定性和收敛性，并能发现语义明确的子目标。

Conclusion: VRAIL是一种通用的、模型无关的奖励变换框架，能同时提升学习效果和可解释性。

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable
Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL)
that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL
consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value
function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning
via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either
linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual
features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment
demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to
standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis
shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger
possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.
Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework
for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Method: 采用Riemannian梯度下降（RGD）优化正交约束的张量分解问题，利用Stiefel流形上的几何结构。

Result: 在适当初始化下，RGD以线性速率收敛到真实张量，且收敛速率和初始化要求与张量维度呈多项式关系。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了高维张量分解的收敛性能和计算效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using
approximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce
the number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order
tensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the
order. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis
across domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum
physics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is
to optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as
gradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and
tensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly
nonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing
significant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.
  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach
to solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging
the canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained
to be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient
descent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.
Under a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian
regularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges
to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,
both the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially
rather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker
and tensor-train format tensors.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have revolutionized information
retrieval and question answering, but traditional text-based chunking methods
struggle with complex document structures, multi-page tables, embedded figures,

batches with cross-batch context preservation, enabling accurate handling of

manually crafted queries, demonstrating improvements in chunk quality and
downstream RAG performance. Our vision-guided approach achieves better accuracy
compared to traditional vanilla RAG systems, with qualitative analysis showing
superior preservation of document structure and semantic coherence.

Conclusion: 该框架为协作式ML项目提供了生命周期感知的可重复性解决方案。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a central challenge in machine learning (ML),
especially in collaborative eScience projects where teams iterate over data,
features, and models. Current ML workflows are often dynamic yet fragmented,
relying on informal data sharing, ad hoc scripts, and loosely connected tools.
This fragmentation impedes transparency, reproducibility, and the adaptability
of experiments over time. This paper introduces a data-centric framework for
lifecycle-aware reproducibility, centered around six structured artifacts:
Dataset, Feature, Workflow, Execution, Asset, and Controlled Vocabulary. These
artifacts formalize the relationships between data, code, and decisions,
enabling ML experiments to be versioned, interpretable, and traceable over
time. The approach is demonstrated through a clinical ML use case of glaucoma
detection, illustrating how the system supports iterative exploration, improves
reproducibility, and preserves the provenance of collaborative decisions across
the ML lifecycle.

Motivation: 现有EEG预训练方法仅依赖单一视角，难以捕捉多视角的复杂交互，限制了表征的泛化能力。

Method: 提出CRIA框架，利用变长变通道编码和跨注意力机制融合时空谱特征，结合信息瓶颈和视角掩码预训练策略。

Result: 在Temple University EEG和CHB-MIT数据集上，CRIA在事件分类和异常检测中分别达到57.02%和80.03%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: CRIA通过多视角融合和自适应机制显著提升了EEG表征的泛化能力。

Abstract: The difficulty of extracting deep features from EEG data and effectively
integrating information from multiple views presents significant challenges for
developing a generalizable pretraining framework for EEG representation
learning. However, most existing pre-training methods rely solely on the
contextual semantics of a single view, failing to capture the complex and
synergistic interactions among different perspectives, limiting the
expressiveness and generalization of learned representations. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CRIA, an adaptive framework that utilizes
variable-length and variable-channel coding to achieve a unified representation
of EEG data across different datasets. In this work, we define cross-view
information as the integrated representation that emerges from the interaction
among temporal, spectral, and spatial views of EEG signals. The model employs a
cross-attention mechanism to fuse temporal, spectral, and spatial features
effectively, and combines an attention matrix masking strategy based on the
information bottleneck principle with a novel viewpoint masking pre-training
scheme. Experimental results on the Temple University EEG corpus and the
CHB-MIT dataset show that CRIA outperforms existing methods with the same
pre-training conditions, achieving a balanced accuracy of 57.02% for
multi-class event classification and 80.03% for anomaly detection, highlighting
its strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 经典UA和IUA定理基于无限精度实数假设，但实际神经网络使用有限精度浮点数计算，因此需要验证IUA在浮点设置下是否成立。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明了浮点神经网络在浮点设置下仍能实现区间通用逼近。

Conclusion: 浮点IUA定理揭示了浮点与实数计算模型的根本差异，并展示了浮点神经网络的强大表达能力。

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks
establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can
approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result
shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal
approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation
semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct
image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with
arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption
that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas
their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision
floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds
in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural
networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct
image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their
expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material
differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental
distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies
surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust
floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the
class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and
multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMMSE预编码在实际部署中因完美CSI假设和高计算复杂性受限，需要改进以适应大规模系统。

Method: 开发了宽频随机WMMSE（SWMMSE）算法，并基于此设计了RLDDU-Net，结合深度展开和强化学习优化性能。

Result: RLDDU-Net在不完美CSI下表现优于现有基线，同时提高了计算和收敛效率。

Conclusion: RLDDU-Net为大规模MU-MIMO-OFDM系统提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) precoding is widely recognized for
its near-optimal weighted sum rate performance. However, its practical
deployment in massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is hindered by the
assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI) and high computational
complexity. To address these issues, we first develop a wideband stochastic
WMMSE (SWMMSE) algorithm that iteratively maximizes the ergodic weighted
sum-rate (EWSR) under imperfect CSI. Building on this, we propose a lightweight
reinforcement learning (RL)-driven deep unfolding (DU) network (RLDDU-Net),
where each SWMMSE iteration is mapped to a network layer. Specifically, its DU
module integrates approximation techniques and leverages beam-domain sparsity
as well as frequency-domain subcarrier correlation, significantly accelerating
convergence and reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, the RL module
adaptively adjusts the network depth and generates compensation matrices to
mitigate approximation errors. Simulation results under imperfect CSI
demonstrate that RLDDU-Net outperforms existing baselines in EWSR performance
while offering superior computational and convergence efficiency.

Result: 仿真显示CAAC在能效和QoS满足率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAAC通过动态优化策略，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了系统性能。

Abstract: 6G wireless networks are expected to support diverse quality-of-service (QoS)
demands while maintaining high energy efficiency. Weighted Minimum Mean Square
Error (WMMSE) precoding with fixed user priorities and transmit power is widely
recognized for enhancing overall system performance but lacks flexibility to
adapt to user-specific QoS requirements and time-varying channel conditions. To
address this, we propose a novel constrained reinforcement learning (CRL)
algorithm, Constrained-Actor Attentive-Critic (CAAC), which uses a policy
network to dynamically allocate user priorities and power for WMMSE precoding.
Specifically, CAAC integrates a Constrained Stochastic Successive Convex
Approximation (CSSCA) method to optimize the policy, enabling more effective
handling of energy efficiency goals and satisfaction of stochastic non-convex
QoS constraints compared to traditional and existing CRL methods. Moreover,
CAAC employs lightweight attention-enhanced Q-networks to evaluate policy
updates without prior environment model knowledge. The network architecture not
only enhances representational capacity but also boosts learning efficiency.
Simulation results show that CAAC outperforms baselines in both energy
efficiency and QoS satisfaction.

Result: 实验表明LAPT能提升对齐鲁棒性且不影响模型通用能力。

Conclusion: 当前对齐范式存在根本缺陷，需转向表示级训练策略。

Abstract: Safety alignment is a key requirement for building reliable Artificial
General Intelligence. Despite significant advances in safety alignment, we
observe that minor latent shifts can still trigger unsafe responses in aligned
models. We argue that this stems from the shallow nature of existing alignment
methods, which focus on surface-level refusal behaviors without sufficiently
altering internal representations. Consequently, small shifts in hidden
activations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To
explore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we
introduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the
original response generated by the model. This probe quantifies local
sensitivity in the latent space, serving as a diagnostic tool for identifying
vulnerable directions. Based on this signal, we construct effective jailbreak
trajectories, giving rise to the Activation Steering Attack (ASA). More
importantly, these insights offer a principled foundation for improving
alignment robustness. To this end, we introduce Layer-wise Adversarial Patch
Training~(LAPT), a fine-tuning strategy that inject controlled perturbations
into hidden representations during training. Experimental results highlight
that LAPT strengthen alignment robustness without compromising general
capabilities. Our findings reveal fundamental flaws in current alignment
paradigms and call for representation-level training strategies that move
beyond surface-level behavior supervision. Codes and results are available at

Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using
functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook
the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of
site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates
the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph
modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage
brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine
the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network.
In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is
incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate
confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE
I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing
interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and
personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical
applicability.

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了结构瓶颈减少和图特性保留，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The message-passing paradigm of Graph Neural Networks often struggles with
exchanging information across distant nodes typically due to structural
bottlenecks in certain graph regions, a limitation known as
\textit{over-squashing}. To reduce such bottlenecks, \textit{graph rewiring},
which modifies graph topology, has been widely used. However, existing graph
rewiring techniques often overlook the need to preserve critical properties of
the original graph, e.g., \textit{spectral properties}. Moreover, many
approaches rely on increasing edge count to improve connectivity, which
introduces significant computational overhead and exacerbates the risk of
over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph rewiring method that
leverages \textit{spectrum-preserving} graph \textit{sparsification}, for
mitigating over-squashing. Our method generates graphs with enhanced
connectivity while maintaining sparsity and largely preserving the original
graph spectrum, effectively balancing structural bottleneck reduction and graph
property preservation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating its superiority over strong baseline methods in
classification accuracy and retention of the Laplacian spectrum.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize parts of their training

research has focused on studying memorization in pre-trained models, much less
is known about how knowledge distillation (KD) affects memorization.In this
study, we explore how different KD methods influence the memorization of
fine-tuned task data when a large teacher model is distilled into smaller
student variants.This study demonstrates that distilling a larger teacher
model, fine-tuned on a dataset, into a smaller variant not only lowers
computational costs and model size but also significantly reduces the
memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Conclusion: AI在翻译复杂语言和艺术表达时仍存在挑战，但方法适用于此类测试。

Abstract: All languages are peculiar. Some of them are considered more challenging to
understand than others. The Finnish Language is known to be a complex language.
Also, when languages are used by artists, the pronunciation and meaning might
be more tricky to understand. Therefore, we are putting AI to a fun, yet
challenging trial: translating a Finnish rap song to text. We will compare the
Faster Whisperer algorithm and YouTube's internal speech-to-text functionality.
The reference truth will be Finnish rap lyrics, which the main author's little
brother, Mc Timo, has written. Transcribing the lyrics will be challenging
because the artist raps over synth music player by Syntikka Janne. The
hallucination level and mishearing of AI speech-to-text extractions will be
measured by comparing errors made against the original Finnish lyrics. The
error function is informal but still works for our case.

Result: POST降低了计算成本，保护了隐私，并成功转移了高效软提示。

Conclusion: POST为软提示的私有化和高效转移提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Prompting has become a dominant paradigm for adapting large language models
(LLMs). While discrete (textual) prompts are widely used for their
interpretability, soft (parameter) prompts have recently gained traction in
APIs. This is because they can encode information from more training samples
while minimizing the user's token usage, leaving more space in the context
window for task-specific input. However, soft prompts are tightly coupled to
the LLM they are tuned on, limiting their generalization to other LLMs. This
constraint is particularly problematic for efficiency and privacy: (1) tuning
prompts on each LLM incurs high computational costs, especially as LLMs
continue to grow in size. Additionally, (2) when the LLM is hosted externally,
soft prompt tuning often requires sharing private data with the LLM provider.
For instance, this is the case with the NVIDIA NeMo API. To address these
issues, we propose POST (Privacy Of Soft prompt Transfer), a framework that
enables private tuning of soft prompts on a small model and subsequently
transfers these prompts to a larger LLM. POST uses knowledge distillation to
derive a small model directly from the large LLM to improve prompt
transferability, tunes the soft prompt locally, optionally with differential
privacy guarantees, and transfers it back to the larger LLM using a small
public dataset. Our experiments show that POST reduces computational costs,
preserves privacy, and effectively transfers high-utility soft prompts.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to optimize the radio resource management of a
communication system between a remote controller and its device, whose state is
represented through image frames, without compromising the performance of the
control task. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) technique to jointly
model and predict the dynamics of the control system as well as the wireless
propagation environment in latent space. Our method leverages two coupled
joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPAs): a control JEPA models the
control dynamics and guides the predictions of a wireless JEPA, which captures
the dynamics of the device's channel state information (CSI) through
cross-modal conditioning. We then train a deep reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm to derive a control policy from latent control dynamics and a power
predictor to estimate scheduling intervals with favorable channel conditions
based on latent CSI representations. As such, the controller minimizes the
usage of radio resources by utilizing the coupled JEPA networks to imagine the
device's trajectory in latent space. We present simulation results on synthetic
multimodal data and show that our proposed approach reduces transmit power by
over 50% while maintaining control performance comparable to baseline methods
that do not account for wireless optimization.

Result: 在多种数据集上表现优于现有方法，结构准确性更高，且对语言模型噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLANCE成功整合了语言模型和观测数据，为因果发现提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data typically assumes full access to
data and availability of domain experts. In practice, data often arrive in
batches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a
surrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and
bias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid
Bayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential
batch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both
data-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates
ambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global
LM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a
sequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative
edges. Across varied datasets, BLANCE outperforms prior work in structural
accuracy and extends to Bayesian parameter estimation, showing robustness to LM
noise.

Conclusion: 该方法为MRI加速采集提供了自适应、任务依赖的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: A key challenge in maximizing the benefits of Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) in clinical settings is to accelerate acquisition times without
significantly degrading image quality. This objective requires a balance
between under-sampling the raw k-space measurements for faster acquisitions and
gathering sufficient raw information for high-fidelity image reconstruction and
analysis tasks. To achieve this balance, we propose to use sequential Bayesian
experimental design (BED) to provide an adaptive and task-dependent selection
of the most informative measurements. Measurements are sequentially augmented
with new samples selected to maximize information gain on a posterior
distribution over target images. Selection is performed via a gradient-based
optimization of a design parameter that defines a subsampling pattern. In this
work, we introduce a new active BED procedure that leverages diffusion-based
generative models to handle the high dimensionality of the images and employs
stochastic optimization to select among a variety of patterns while meeting the
acquisition process constraints and budget. So doing, we show how our setting
can optimize, not only standard image reconstruction, but also any associated
image analysis task. The versatility and performance of our approach are
demonstrated on several MRI acquisitions.

Conclusion: 合成信号可用于数据增强，改善分类器性能，促进数据共享和诊断模型优化。

Abstract: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, and
high-quality EEG data from ALS patients are scarce. This data scarcity, coupled
with severe class imbalance between ALS and healthy control recordings, poses a
challenge for training reliable machine learning classifiers. In this work, we
address these issues by generating synthetic EEG signals for ALS patients using
a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN). We train
CWGAN on a private EEG dataset (ALS vs. non-ALS) to learn the distribution of
ALS EEG signals and produce realistic synthetic samples. We preprocess and
normalize EEG recordings, and train a CWGAN model to generate synthetic ALS
signals. The CWGAN architecture and training routine are detailed, with key
hyperparameters chosen for stable training. Qualitative evaluation of generated
signals shows that they closely mimic real ALS EEG patterns. The CWGAN training
converged with generator and discriminator loss curves stabilizing, indicating
successful learning. The synthetic EEG signals appear realistic and have
potential use as augmented data for training classifiers, helping to mitigate
class imbalance and improve ALS detection accuracy. We discuss how this
approach can facilitate data sharing and enhance diagnostic models.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了庄家策略与Hermite多项式的关系，并提供了实际可行的算法，为博彩行业提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the Online Bookmaking problem, where a bookmaker dynamically updates
betting odds on the possible outcomes of an event. In each betting round, the
bookmaker can adjust the odds based on the cumulative betting behavior of
gamblers, aiming to maximize profit while mitigating potential loss. We show
that for any event and any number of betting rounds, in a worst-case setting
over all possible gamblers and outcome realizations, the bookmaker's optimal
loss is the largest root of a simple polynomial. Our solution shows that
bookmakers can be as fair as desired while avoiding financial risk, and the
explicit characterization reveals an intriguing relation between the
bookmaker's regret and Hermite polynomials. We develop an efficient algorithm
that computes the optimal bookmaking strategy: when facing an optimal gambler,
the algorithm achieves the optimal loss, and in rounds where the gambler is
suboptimal, it reduces the achieved loss to the optimal opportunistic loss, a
notion that is related to subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The key technical
contribution to achieve these results is an explicit characterization of the
Bellman-Pareto frontier, which unifies the dynamic programming updates for
Bellman's value function with the multi-criteria optimization framework of the
Pareto frontier in the context of vector repeated games.

Method: 提出MetaHMM合成序列元学习基准，并设计蒙特卡洛预测方法，将任务推理与标记预测分离。

Result: 实验表明，Transformer模型在高模糊性预测中表现较差，而蒙特卡洛方法在模糊情境中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 蒙特卡洛预测方法能有效改善高模糊性预测，但仍存在挑战。

Abstract: The rapid adaptation ability of auto-regressive foundation models is often
attributed to the diversity of their pre-training data. This is because, from a
Bayesian standpoint, minimizing prediction error in such settings requires
integrating over all plausible latent hypotheses consistent with observations.
While this behavior is desirable in principle, it often proves too ambitious in
practice: under high ambiguity, the number of plausible latent alternatives
makes Bayes-optimal prediction computationally intractable. Cognitive science
has long recognized this limitation, suggesting that under such conditions,
heuristics or information-seeking strategies are preferable to exhaustive
inference. Translating this insight to next-token prediction, we hypothesize
that low- and high-ambiguity predictions pose different computational demands,
making ambiguity-agnostic next-token prediction a detrimental inductive bias.
To test this, we introduce MetaHMM, a synthetic sequence meta-learning
benchmark with rich compositional structure and a tractable Bayesian oracle. We
show that Transformers indeed struggle with high-ambiguity predictions across
model sizes. Motivated by cognitive theories, we propose a method to convert
pre-trained models into Monte Carlo predictors that decouple task inference
from token prediction. Preliminary results show substantial gains in ambiguous
contexts through improved capacity allocation and test-time scalable inference,
though challenges remain.

Conclusion: 该系统通过可扩展的口音-情感解耦，为跨语言合成提供了更可行的解决方案，适用于南亚教育科技和辅助软件。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) systems realize high naturalness in
monolingual environments, synthesizing speech with correct multilingual accents
(especially for Indic languages) and context-relevant emotions still poses
difficulty owing to cultural nuance discrepancies in current frameworks. This
paper introduces a new TTS architecture integrating accent along with
preserving transliteration with multi-scale emotion modelling, in particularly
tuned for Hindi and Indian English accent. Our approach extends the Parler-TTS
model by integrating A language-specific phoneme alignment hybrid
encoder-decoder architecture, and culture-sensitive emotion embedding layers
trained on native speaker corpora, as well as incorporating a dynamic accent
code switching with residual vector quantization. Quantitative tests
demonstrate 23.7% improvement in accent accuracy (Word Error Rate reduction
from 15.4% to 11.8%) and 85.3% emotion recognition accuracy from native
listeners, surpassing METTS and VECL-TTS baselines. The novelty of the system
is that it can mix code in real time - generating statements such as "Namaste,
let's talk about <Hindi phrase>" with uninterrupted accent shifts while
preserving emotional consistency. Subjective evaluation with 200 users reported
a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.2/5 for cultural correctness, much better than
existing multilingual systems (p<0.01). This research makes cross-lingual
synthesis more feasible by showcasing scalable accent-emotion disentanglement,
with direct application in South Asian EdTech and accessibility software.

Result: 在网格环境和结构化序列生成中，ENN-GFN-Enhanced优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了探索效率和最优轨迹的识别能力。

Abstract: Efficiently identifying the right trajectories for training remains an open
problem in GFlowNets. To address this, it is essential to prioritize
exploration in regions of the state space where the reward distribution has not
been sufficiently learned. This calls for uncertainty-driven exploration, in
other words, the agent should be aware of what it does not know. This attribute
can be measured by joint predictions, which are particularly important for
combinatorial and sequential decision problems. In this research, we integrate
epistemic neural networks (ENN) with the conventional architecture of GFlowNets
to enable more efficient joint predictions and better uncertainty
quantification, thereby improving exploration and the identification of optimal
trajectories. Our proposed algorithm, ENN-GFN-Enhanced, is compared to the
baseline method in GFlownets and evaluated in grid environments and structured
sequence generation in various settings, demonstrating both its efficacy and
efficiency.

Result: Beta核函数在有界域中表现优异，尤其在优化问题中显著优于Matérn和RBF核函数。

Conclusion: Beta核函数为有界域问题提供了更有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes (GP) is commonly used to
optimize black-box functions. The Mat\'ern and the Radial Basis Function (RBF)
covariance functions are used frequently, but they do not make any assumptions
about the domain of the function, which may limit their applicability in
bounded domains. To address the limitation, we introduce the Beta kernel, a
non-stationary kernel induced by a product of Beta distribution density
functions. Such a formulation allows our kernel to naturally model functions on
bounded domains. We present statistical evidence supporting the hypothesis that
the kernel exhibits an exponential eigendecay rate, based on empirical analyses
of its spectral properties across different settings. Our experimental results
demonstrate the robustness of the Beta kernel in modeling functions with optima
located near the faces or vertices of the unit hypercube. The experiments show
that our kernel consistently outperforms a wide range of kernels, including the
well-known Mat\'ern and RBF, in different problems, including synthetic
function optimization and the compression of vision and language models.

Conclusion: 本文首次实现了在自回归图像生成模型的标记级别嵌入水印，解决了RCC问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising
approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in
autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior
work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work,
we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking
techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse
cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens
significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To
address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations,
neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom
tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a
complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate,
our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically
grounded p-values.

Abstract: Increasing global energy demand and renewable integration complexity have
placed buildings at the center of sustainable energy management. We present a

(BEMS) that combines clustering, forecasting, and constrained policy learning
to address scalability, adaptability, and safety challenges. First, we cluster
non-shiftable load profiles to identify common consumption patterns, enabling
policy generalization and transfer without retraining for each new building.
Next, we integrate an LSTM based forecasting module to anticipate future
states, improving the RL agents' responsiveness to dynamic conditions. Lastly,
domain-informed action masking ensures safe exploration and operation,
preventing harmful decisions. Evaluated on real-world data, our approach
reduces operating costs by up to 15% for certain building types, maintains
stable environmental performance, and quickly classifies and optimizes new
buildings with limited data. It also adapts to stochastic tariff changes
without retraining. Overall, this framework delivers scalable, robust, and
cost-effective building energy management.

synchronized CCTV footage to annotate behaviors such as feeding, rumination,

Conclusion: GoalLadder通过结合VLM和ELO评分系统，有效减少了噪声反馈的影响，显著提升了RL代理的性能。

Abstract: Natural language can offer a concise and human-interpretable means of
specifying reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. The ability to extract rewards
from a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that
can learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,
especially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,
pretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment
representations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate
noisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
$\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL
agents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder
works by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to
completing a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to
identify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to
rank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not
trust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal
states using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects
of noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with
minimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,
which is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to
bypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train
a well-shaped reward function. We demonstrate that GoalLadder outperforms
existing related methods on classic control and robotic manipulation
environments with the average final success rate of $\sim$95% compared to only
$\sim$45% of the best competitor.

Conclusion: Directo为有向图生成研究奠定了坚实基础，展示了其有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Directed graphs naturally model systems with asymmetric, ordered
relationships, essential to applications in biology, transportation, social
networks, and visual understanding. Generating such graphs enables tasks such
as simulation, data augmentation and novel instance discovery; however,
directed graph generation remains underexplored. We identify two key factors
limiting progress in this direction: first, modeling edge directionality
introduces a substantially larger dependency space, making the underlying
distribution harder to learn; second, the absence of standardized benchmarks
hinders rigorous evaluation. Addressing the former requires more expressive
models that are sensitive to directional topologies. We propose Directo, the
first generative model for directed graphs built upon the discrete flow
matching framework. Our approach combines: (i) principled positional encodings
tailored to asymmetric pairwise relations, (ii) a dual-attention mechanism
capturing both incoming and outgoing dependencies, and (iii) a robust, discrete
generative framework. To support evaluation, we introduce a benchmark suite
covering synthetic and real-world datasets. It shows that our method performs
strongly across diverse settings and even competes with specialized models for
particular classes, such as directed acyclic graphs. Our results highlight the
effectiveness and generality of our approach, establishing a solid foundation
for future research in directed graph generation.

Result: DnD在性能上优于传统LoRA方法，计算开销降低12,000倍，并在未见任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提示驱动的参数生成是替代梯度优化的可行方案，能快速适配LLM。

Abstract: Modern Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) reduce the cost of customizing large language models (LLMs),
yet still require a separate optimization run for every downstream dataset. We
introduce \textbf{Drag-and-Drop LLMs (\textit{DnD})}, a prompt-conditioned
parameter generator that eliminates per-task training by mapping a handful of
unlabeled task prompts directly to LoRA weight updates. A lightweight text
encoder distills each prompt batch into condition embeddings, which are then
transformed by a cascaded hyper-convolutional decoder into the full set of LoRA
matrices. Once trained in a diverse collection of prompt-checkpoint pairs, DnD
produces task-specific parameters in seconds, yielding i) up to
\textbf{12,000$\times$} lower overhead than full fine-tuning, ii) average gains
up to \textbf{30\%} in performance over the strongest training LoRAs on unseen
common-sense reasoning, math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks, and iii)
robust cross-domain generalization despite never seeing the target data or
labels. Our results demonstrate that prompt-conditioned parameter generation is
a viable alternative to gradient-based adaptation for rapidly specializing
LLMs. Our project is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了混合专家（MoE）架构中的路由模块设计，通过实验比较了六种路由器变体，提出了新的MLP-Hadamard路由器，并分析了其在参数效率、推理延迟等方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构的可扩展性依赖于路由模块，但不良路由会导致负载不平衡和准确性下降，因此需要优化路由设计。

Method: 设计了六种路由器变体（Linear、Attention、MLP、Hybrid、Hash、MLP-Hadamard），并在BERT和Qwen1.5-MoE模型上进行了实验评估。

Result: 不同路由器各有优劣：Linear速度快，MLP和Attention表现力强，MLP-Hadamard在结构化稀疏路由中表现独特。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE路由设计提供了比较分析，并为大规模模型部署的优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures increase large language model
scalability, yet their performance depends on the router module that moves
tokens to specialized experts. Bad routing can load imbalance and reduced
accuracy. This project designed and implemented different router architectures
within Transformer models to fix these limitations. We experimented with six
distinct router variants Linear, Attention, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Hybrid, Hash, and our new MLP-Hadamard. We characterized these routers using
BERT and the Qwen1.5-MoE model, looking at parameter efficiency, inference
latency, routing entropy, and expert utilization patterns. Our evaluations
showed distinct trade-offs: Linear routers offer speed, while MLP and Attention
routers provide greater expressiveness. The MLP-Hadamard router shows a unique
capability for structured, sparse routing. We successfully replaced and
fine-tuned custom routers within the complex, quantized Qwen1.5-MoE model. This
work provides a comparative analysis of MoE router designs and offers insights
into optimizing their performance for efficient and effective large-scale model
deployment.

TL;DR: EFormer是一种基于边的Transformer模型，用于解决车辆路径问题（VRP），通过并行编码和解码策略，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经启发式方法主要依赖节点坐标作为输入，但在实际场景中，基于边的距离等成本指标更为重要。

Method: EFormer采用预编码模块和并行编码策略，结合图编码器和节点编码器，通过强化学习进行自回归训练。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP的合成数据集上表现优异，且在真实数据集TSPLib和CVRPLib上具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EFormer的设计有效解决了VRP问题，验证了其核心方法的优越性。

Abstract: Recent neural heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) primarily rely
on node coordinates as input, which may be less effective in practical
scenarios where real cost metrics-such as edge-based distances-are more
relevant. To address this limitation, we introduce EFormer, an Edge-based
Transformer model that uses edge as the sole input for VRPs. Our approach
employs a precoder module with a mixed-score attention mechanism to convert
edge information into temporary node embeddings. We also present a parallel
encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder and a node encoder, each
responsible for processing graph and node embeddings in distinct feature
spaces, respectively. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of
the global relationships among edges. In the decoding phase, parallel context
embedding and multi-query integration are used to compute separate attention
mechanisms over the two encoded embeddings, facilitating efficient path
construction. We train EFormer using reinforcement learning in an
autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) reveal that EFormer
outperforms established baselines on synthetic datasets, including large-scale
and diverse distributions. Moreover, EFormer demonstrates strong generalization
on real-world instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. These findings confirm the
effectiveness of EFormer's core design in solving VRPs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在ICL中是否真正理解潜在概念，而非仅通过捷径解决问题。

Method: 通过2跳推理任务（离散潜在概念）和连续潜在概念任务，分析模型的表示空间和解耦能力。

Result: 模型成功识别离散潜在概念并逐步组合；在连续潜在概念任务中，表示空间的几何结构与潜在参数化一致。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对ICL和Transformer表示的理解，证明了模型在ICL任务中解耦潜在概念的局部化结构。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a
new task, they seem to grasp not only the goal of the task but also core,
latent concepts in the demonstration examples. This begs the question of
whether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation
or whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on
ICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the
relationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the
considered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this
work, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show
that in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model
successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept
composition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find
low-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics
the underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our
understanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide
evidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent
concepts in ICL tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何利用XAI中的影响函数优化PINNs的训练数据采样，以提升模型性能。

Result: 基于数据归因方法的采样策略能有效提高PINNs的预测准确性。

Conclusion: XAI方法在PINN训练中具有实际应用价值，能通过优化数据采样提升性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful approach to solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are ubiquitous in the quantitative
sciences. Applied to both forward and inverse problems across various
scientific domains, PINNs have recently emerged as a valuable tool in the field
of scientific machine learning. A key aspect of their training is that the data
-- spatio-temporal points sampled from the PDE's input domain -- are readily
available. Influence functions, a tool from the field of explainable AI (XAI),
approximate the effect of individual training points on the model, enhancing
interpretability. In the present work, we explore the application of influence
function-based sampling approaches for the training data. Our results indicate
that such targeted resampling based on data attribution methods has the
potential to enhance prediction accuracy in physics-informed neural networks,
demonstrating a practical application of an XAI method in PINN training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAMD的方法，用于将复杂概念映射到Transformer模型的特定注意力头上，并通过SAMI策略调整这些模块的效果。实验表明，该方法在语言和视觉任务中均有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的研究主要关注简单的概念（如事实关联），忽略了注意力机制的影响，且缺乏分析复杂概念的统一方法。

Method: SAMD通过将概念表示为向量，计算其与每个注意力头的余弦相似度，选择TopK得分头构建概念相关模块；SAMI通过调整单个标量参数来增强或减弱概念效果。

Result: 实验显示模块位置在LLM训练前后稳定，SAMI能显著提升或抑制任务表现（如安全性和推理能力）。

Conclusion: SAMD和SAMI为Transformer模型的解释和行为控制提供了通用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across language and
vision tasks. This success drives the imperative to interpret their internal
mechanisms with the dual goals of enhancing performance and improving
behavioral control. Attribution methods help advance interpretability by
assigning model outputs associated with a target concept to specific model
components. Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer
perceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual
associations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook
the impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for
analyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable
Attention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping
arbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer
models. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,
calculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the
TopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We
then propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to
diminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module
using only a single scalar parameter. Empirically, we demonstrate SAMD on
concepts of varying complexity, and visualize the locations of their
corresponding modules. Our results demonstrate that module locations remain
stable before and after LLM post-training, and confirm prior work on the
mechanics of LLM multilingualism. Through SAMI, we facilitate jailbreaking on
HarmBench (+72.7%) by diminishing "safety" and improve performance on the GSM8K
benchmark (+1.6%) by amplifying "reasoning". Lastly, we highlight the
domain-agnostic nature of our approach by suppressing the image classification
accuracy of vision transformers on ImageNet.

Motivation: 开发一种能够在真实场景下进行EEG情绪识别的深度学习模型。

Method: 利用多尺度卷积神经网络，结合多种比例系数的特征提取核和一种新型核（从大脑四个区域学习关键信息）。

Abstract: EEG is a non-invasive, safe, and low-risk method to record
electrophysiological signals inside the brain. Especially with recent
technology developments like dry electrodes, consumer-grade EEG devices, and
rapid advances in machine learning, EEG is commonly used as a resource for
automatic emotion recognition. With the aim to develop a deep learning model

propose a novel approach to utilize multi-scale convolutional neural networks
to accomplish such tasks. By implementing feature extraction kernels with many
ratio coefficients as well as a new type of kernel that learns key information
from four separate areas of the brain, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art TSception model in predicting valence, arousal, and dominance
scores across many performance evaluation metrics.

Result: 实验表明，TensorGuide在量子点分类和GPT-2微调任务中优于标准LoRA和TT-LoRA。

Conclusion: TensorGuide在不增加参数的情况下显著提升了性能，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely recognized for its parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large-scale neural models. However, standard LoRA independently
optimizes low-rank matrices, which inherently limits its expressivity and
generalization capabilities. While classical tensor-train (TT) decomposition
can be separately employed on individual LoRA matrices, this work demonstrates
that the classical TT-based approach neither significantly improves parameter
efficiency nor achieves substantial performance gains. This paper proposes
TensorGuide, a novel tensor-train-guided adaptation framework to overcome these
limitations. TensorGuide generates two correlated low-rank LoRA matrices
through a unified TT structure driven by controlled Gaussian noise. The
resulting joint TT representation inherently provides structured, low-rank
adaptations, significantly enhancing expressivity, generalization, and
parameter efficiency without increasing the number of trainable parameters.
Theoretically, we justify these improvements through neural tangent kernel
analyses, demonstrating superior optimization dynamics and enhanced
generalization. Extensive experiments on quantum dot classification and GPT-2
fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that TensorGuide-based LoRA consistently
outperforms standard LoRA and TT-LoRA, achieving improved accuracy and
scalability with fewer parameters.

Result: 实验证明攻击在视觉和语言领域有效，即使仅使用新样本也能推断任务是否参与训练。

Conclusion: 共享表示存在信息泄露风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm that leverages
similarities among multiple learning tasks, each with insufficient samples to
train a standalone model, to solve them simultaneously while minimizing data
sharing across users and organizations. MTL typically accomplishes this goal by
learning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks
by embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being
designed to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively
learn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can
inadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were
trained on.
  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared
representations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose
a novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the
embedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples
from a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when
training the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box
attacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between
embeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled
reference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for
multiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh
task samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully
infer a task's inclusion in training. To complement our experiments, we provide
theoretical analysis of a simplified learning setting and show a strict
separation between adversaries with training samples and fresh samples from the
target task's distribution.

Conclusion: PITA为复杂系统的扩散采样提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sampling efficiently from a target unnormalized probability density remains a
core challenge, with relevance across countless high-impact scientific
applications. A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of
amortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from
state-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing
diffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at
the scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn
diffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation
techniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion
smoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low
temperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher
temperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the
temperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables
simulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower
temperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using
a novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA
enables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,
Alanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically
lower energy function evaluations. Code available at:

Conclusion: NLDR在心脏监测和个性化医疗中潜力巨大，适用于单导联和12导联ECG。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide direct, non-invasive measurements of heart
activity and are well-established tools for detecting and monitoring
cardiovascular disease. However, manual ECG analysis can be time-consuming and
prone to errors. Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for
automated heartbeat recognition and classification, but substantial variations
in ECG signals make it challenging to develop generalizable models. ECG signals
can vary widely across individuals and leads, while datasets often follow
different labeling standards and may be biased, all of which greatly hinder
supervised methods. Conventional unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component
analysis, prioritize large (and often obvious) variances in the data and
typically overlook subtle yet clinically relevant patterns. If labels are
missing and/or variations are significant but small, both approaches fail.
Here, we show that nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) can accommodate
these issues and identify medically relevant features in ECG signals, with no
need for training or prior information. Using the MLII and V1 leads of the
MIT-BIH dataset, we demonstrate that t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding and uniform manifold approximation and projection can discriminate
individual recordings in mixed populations with >= 90% accuracy and distinguish
different arrhythmias in individual patients with a median accuracy of 98.96%
and a median F1-score of 91.02%. The results show that NLDR holds much promise
for cardiac monitoring, including the limiting cases of single-lead ECG and the
current 12-lead standard of care, and for personalized health care beyond
cardiology.

Conclusion: SparseLoRA是一种高效且实用的LLM微调方法，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the
number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease
computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this
paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning
through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD
sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss
and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address
sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results
show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a
measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various
downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code
generation, and instruction following.

Conclusion: Subspace Boosting有效解决秩崩溃问题，为模型合并提供了新的可解释视角。

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models
into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits
of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to
diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we
offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing
that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods)
continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space
experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace
Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and
maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up
to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on vision
benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition to further quantify task similarity, offering a new
interpretable perspective on model merging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型（RMs）在训练中容易受到奖励黑客的影响，即模型会错误地将表面或虚假属性（如回答长度或格式）与质量（如事实性、相关性）混淆。

Method: Crome框架通过因果增强（针对因果属性）和中性增强（针对虚假属性）进行训练，无需了解虚假因素，仅通过因果干预生成增强数据。

Result: Crome在RewardBench上平均准确率提升5.4%，某些类别提升高达13.2%和7.2%，并在多个基准测试中表现稳健。

Conclusion: Crome通过因果建模有效缓解了奖励黑客问题，显著提升了奖励模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are fundamental to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs)
via human feedback, yet they often suffer from reward hacking. They tend to
latch on to superficial or spurious attributes, such as response length or
formatting, mistaking these cues learned from correlations in training data for
the true causal drivers of quality (e.g., factuality, relevance). This occurs
because standard training objectives struggle to disentangle these factors,
leading to brittle RMs and misaligned policies. We introduce Crome (Causally
Robust Reward Modeling), a novel framework grounded in an explicit causal model
designed to mitigate reward hacking. Crome employs the following synthetic
targeted augmentations during training: (1) Causal Augmentations, which are
pairs that differ along specific causal attributes, to enforce sensitivity
along each causal attribute individually, and (2) Neutral Augmentations, which
are tie-label pairs varying primarily in spurious attributes, to enforce
invariance along spurious attributes. Notably, our augmentations are produced
without any knowledge of spurious factors, via answer interventions only along
causal rubrics, that are identified by querying an oracle LLM. Empirically,
Crome significantly outperforms standard baselines on RewardBench, improving
average accuracy by up to 5.4% and achieving gains of up to 13.2% and 7.2% in
specific categories. The robustness of Crome is further testified by the
consistent gains obtained in a Best-of-N inference setting across increasing N,
across various benchmarks, including the popular RewardBench (covering chat,
chat-hard, safety, and reasoning tasks), the safety-focused WildGuardTest, and
the reasoning-specific GSM8k.

Motivation: 传统ASR指标（如WER和CER）无法准确捕捉语音可懂度，特别是在构音障碍和发声障碍语音中，语义对齐比精确单词匹配更重要。

Method: 提出了一种新指标，整合了自然语言推理（NLI）分数、语义相似性和语音相似性。

Result: 新指标在Speech Accessibility Project数据上与人类判断的相关性达到0.890，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 新指标强调了在ASR评估中优先考虑可懂度而非基于错误的方法的重要性。

Abstract: Traditional ASR metrics like WER and CER fail to capture intelligibility,
especially for dysarthric and dysphonic speech, where semantic alignment
matters more than exact word matches. ASR systems struggle with these speech
types, often producing errors like phoneme repetitions and imprecise
consonants, yet the meaning remains clear to human listeners. We identify two
key challenges: (1) Existing metrics do not adequately reflect intelligibility,
and (2) while LLMs can refine ASR output, their effectiveness in correcting ASR
transcripts of dysarthric speech remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose a novel metric integrating Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores,
semantic similarity, and phonetic similarity. Our ASR evaluation metric
achieves a 0.890 correlation with human judgments on Speech Accessibility
Project data, surpassing traditional methods and emphasizing the need to
prioritize intelligibility over error-based measures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RMU的技术，用于从大语言模型中移除敏感信息，解决了隐私和版权问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型可能记忆训练数据中的敏感信息，引发隐私和版权问题，现有方法对此处理不足。

Method: 采用自适应表示误导遗忘（RMU）技术，分析不同解码层对敏感信息移除的效果。

Result: RMU技术在1B和7B参数模型官方排行榜上均排名第4。

Conclusion: RMU技术能有效移除大语言模型中的敏感信息，为隐私保护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation. However, their tendency to
memorize training data raises concerns regarding privacy, copyright compliance,
and security, particularly in cases involving Personally Identifiable
Information (PII). Effective machine unlearning techniques are essential to
mitigate these risks, yet existing methods remain underdeveloped for LLMs due
to their open-ended output space. In this work, we apply the Adaptive
Representation Misdirection Unlearning (RMU) technique to unlearn sensitive
information from LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the effects of
unlearning across different decoder layers to determine the most effective
regions for sensitive information removal. Our technique ranked 4th on the
official leaderboard of both 1B parameter and 7B parameter models.

Motivation: 通过将token嵌入和注意力机制表示为自伴算子，重新解释注意力为非交换卷积，从而深入理解Transformer架构的信息流和结构复杂性。

Method: 使用自由概率理论工具，将注意力机制建模为非交换卷积，并通过自由加性卷积分析表示在层间的传播。

Result: 提出了基于自由熵的泛化界，并证明Transformer层的谱迹随深度可预测地演化。

Conclusion: 该框架将神经架构与非交换调和分析联系起来，为大型语言模型的信息流和结构复杂性提供了理论分析基础。

Abstract: We outline an operator-theoretic framework for analyzing transformer-based
language models using the tools of free probability theory. By representing
token embeddings and attention mechanisms as self-adjoint operators in a racial
probability space, we reinterpret attention as a non-commutative convolution
and view the layer-wise propagation of representations as an evolution governed
by free additive convolution. This formalism reveals a spectral dynamical
system underpinning deep transformer stacks and offers insight into their
inductive biases, generalization behavior, and entropy dynamics. We derive a
generalization bound based on free entropy and demonstrate that the spectral
trace of transformer layers evolves predictably with depth. Our approach
bridges neural architecture with non-commutative harmonic analysis, enabling
principled analysis of information flow and structural complexity in large
language models

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种单样本鲁棒共形预测（RCP1）方法，通过单次随机扰动输入实现鲁棒性，减少了计算开销，并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于平滑的鲁棒共形预测（RCP）方法需要多次模型前向传递，计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 利用二元证书对共形预测过程本身进行认证，而非单个分数，提出RCP1方法，适用于分类和回归任务。

Result: RCP1在保持鲁棒性的同时，平均预测集大小更小，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RCP1通过单次扰动输入实现鲁棒性，显著降低了计算成本，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Given any model, conformal prediction (CP) returns prediction sets guaranteed
to include the true label with high adjustable probability. Robust CP (RCP)
extends this to inputs with worst-case noise. A well-established approach is to
use randomized smoothing for RCP since it is applicable to any black-box model
and provides smaller sets compared to deterministic methods. However, current
smoothing-based RCP requires many model forward passes per each input which is
computationally expensive. We show that conformal prediction attains some
robustness even with a forward pass on a single randomly perturbed input. Using
any binary certificate we propose a single sample robust CP (RCP1). Our
approach returns robust sets with smaller average set size compared to SOTA
methods which use many (e.g. around 100) passes per input. Our key insight is
to certify the conformal prediction procedure itself rather than individual
scores. Our approach is agnostic to the setup (classification and regression).
We further extend our approach to smoothing-based robust conformal risk
control.

Result: 理论证明能量分数反映教师策略的状态访问密度，实验验证了样本效率和性能的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在单任务和多任务场景中均有效，提高了强化学习的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from poor sample efficiency,
making them challenging to apply in multi-task or continual learning settings.
Efficiency can be improved by transferring knowledge from a previously trained
teacher policy to guide exploration in new but related tasks. However, if the
new task sufficiently differs from the teacher's training task, the transferred
guidance may be sub-optimal and bias exploration toward low-reward behaviors.
We propose an energy-based transfer learning method that uses
out-of-distribution detection to selectively issue guidance, enabling the
teacher to intervene only in states within its training distribution. We
theoretically show that energy scores reflect the teacher's state-visitation
density and empirically demonstrate improved sample efficiency and performance
across both single-task and multi-task settings.

TL;DR: FLAME是一种基于稀疏专家混合（SMoE）架构的新型联邦学习框架，通过动态激活专家数量实现客户端适应性，解决了现有方法因压缩导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有资源自适应的LoRA联邦微调方法因压缩全局LoRA矩阵导致信息丢失，性能不佳。FLAME旨在通过保留完整矩阵并动态调整专家数量来解决这一问题。

Method: FLAME采用SMoE架构，保留完整全局LoRA矩阵，通过调整激活专家数量实现客户端适应性，并引入轻量级重缩放机制和激活感知聚合方案解决输出幅度不匹配和专家训练质量不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明，FLAME在不同计算环境下均优于现有方法，提供了稳健且高效的资源自适应联邦学习解决方案。

Conclusion: FLAME通过SMoE架构和创新的优化机制，显著提升了资源自适应联邦学习的性能，为实际应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients
to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order
to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression
requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To
address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on
the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches,
FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side
adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However,
incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges,
specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation
and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles
these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an
activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse
computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing
methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive
federated learning.

Result: 在多个fMRI和交通数据集上，SlepNet性能优于基线模型，并能提取更高分辨率的信号模式表示。

Conclusion: SlepNet在预测和表示学习方面均表现出色，适用于时空数据任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been useful in machine learning on
graph-structured data, particularly for node classification and some types of
graph classification tasks. However, they have had limited use in representing
patterning of signals over graphs. Patterning of signals over graphs and in
subgraphs carries important information in many domains including neuroscience.
Neural signals are spatiotemporally patterned, high dimensional and difficult
to decode. Graph signal processing and associated GCN models utilize the graph
Fourier transform and are unable to efficiently represent spatially or
spectrally localized signal patterning on graphs. Wavelet transforms have shown
promise here, but offer non-canonical representations and cannot be tightly
confined to subgraphs. Here we propose SlepNet, a novel GCN architecture that
uses Slepian bases rather than graph Fourier harmonics. In SlepNet, the Slepian
harmonics optimally concentrate signal energy on specifically relevant
subgraphs that are automatically learned with a mask. Thus, they can produce
canonical and highly resolved representations of neural activity, focusing
energy of harmonics on areas of the brain which are activated. We evaluated
SlepNet across three fMRI datasets, spanning cognitive and visual tasks, and
two traffic dynamics datasets, comparing its performance against conventional
GNNs and graph signal processing constructs. SlepNet outperforms the baselines
in all datasets. Moreover, the extracted representations of signal patterns
from SlepNet offers more resolution in distinguishing between similar patterns,
and thus represent brain signaling transients as informative trajectories. Here
we have shown that these extracted trajectory representations can be used for
other downstream untrained tasks. Thus we establish that SlepNet is useful both
for prediction and representation learning in spatiotemporal data.

Motivation: 传统强化学习中动作空间的离散或混合性质限制了算法的通用性和效率，需要一种更通用的框架。

Method: 通过将分布参数作为动作，提出DPPG梯度估计器和ICL策略，开发DPAC算法。

Result: DPAC在MuJoCo连续控制任务中优于TD3，在离散动作空间任务中表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 新框架和算法在多种动作空间任务中表现出色，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that treats
distribution parameters as actions, redefining the boundary between agent and
environment. This reparameterization makes the new action space continuous,
regardless of the original action type (discrete, continuous, mixed, etc.).
Under this new parameterization, we develop a generalized deterministic policy
gradient estimator, Distribution Parameter Policy Gradient (DPPG), which has
lower variance than the gradient in the original action space. Although
learning the critic over distribution parameters poses new challenges, we
introduce interpolated critic learning (ICL), a simple yet effective strategy
to enhance learning, supported by insights from bandit settings. Building on
TD3, a strong baseline for continuous control, we propose a practical
DPPG-based actor-critic algorithm, Distribution Parameter Actor-Critic (DPAC).
Empirically, DPAC outperforms TD3 in MuJoCo continuous control tasks from
OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite, and demonstrates competitive performance
on the same environments with discretized action spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神病学中症状异质性和潜在混杂因素使传统因果推断方法失效，需改进结果定义以解决未观测混杂问题。

Method: DEBIAS算法学习非负、临床可解释的权重以聚合结果，最大化持久治疗效果并最小化混杂。

Result: DEBIAS在抑郁和精神分裂症实验中一致优于现有方法，恢复因果效果更优。

Conclusion: DEBIAS通过优化结果定义和验证未混杂性，为精神病学因果推断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge,
especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding
frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment
effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding
through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of
unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this
foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to
maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with
Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,
clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable
treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent
confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments
in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically
verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically
interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression
and schizophrenia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多语言和上下文敏感场景中表现不佳，而LLM成本高，需要一种更优解决方案。

Method: 通过元数据嵌入识别核心内容，标记与异常组匹配或偏离核心的文本段。

Result: 在HTML数据集上表现优于结构方法，高精度且高效。

Conclusion: SORE已部署生产，支持多语言处理，开源实现促进研究。

Abstract: Modern text processing pipelines demand robust methods to remove extraneous
content while preserving a document's core message. Traditional approaches such
as HTML boilerplate extraction or keyword filters often fail in multilingual
settings and struggle with context-sensitive nuances, whereas Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer improved quality at high computational cost. We introduce
SORE (Semantic Outlier Removal), a cost-effective, transparent method that
leverages multilingual sentence embeddings and approximate nearest-neighbor
search to identify and excise unwanted text segments. By first identifying core
content via metadata embedding and then flagging segments that either closely
match predefined outlier groups or deviate significantly from the core, SORE
achieves near-LLM extraction precision at a fraction of the cost. Experiments
on HTML datasets demonstrate that SORE outperforms structural methods and yield
high precision in diverse scenarios. Our system is currently deployed in
production, processing millions of documents daily across multiple languages
while maintaining both efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility
and further research, we release our implementation and evaluation datasets.

Result: 新方法在标准PAC模型中有效，具有更好的样本复杂性和噪声容忍性。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了分布提升过程，适用于更广泛的分布族。

Abstract: The apparent difficulty of efficient distribution-free PAC learning has led
to a large body of work on distribution-specific learning. Distributional
assumptions facilitate the design of efficient algorithms but also limit their
reach and relevance. Towards addressing this, we prove a distributional-lifting
theorem: This upgrades a learner that succeeds with respect to a limited
distribution family $\mathcal{D}$ to one that succeeds with respect to any
distribution $D^\star$, with an efficiency overhead that scales with the
complexity of expressing $D^\star$ as a mixture of distributions in
$\mathcal{D}$.
  Recent work of Blanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan considered the special case of
lifting uniform-distribution learners and designed a lifter that uses a
conditional sample oracle for $D^\star$, a strong form of access not afforded
by the standard PAC model. Their approach, which draws on ideas from
semi-supervised learning, first learns $D^\star$ and then uses this information
to lift.
  We show that their approach is information-theoretically intractable with
access only to random examples, thereby giving formal justification for their
use of the conditional sample oracle. We then take a different approach that
sidesteps the need to learn $D^\star$, yielding a lifter that works in the
standard PAC model and enjoys additional advantages: it works for all base
distribution families, preserves the noise tolerance of learners, has better
sample complexity, and is simpler.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has led to a significant increase in the capabilities
of models that learn on arbitrary graph-structured data and has been applied to
molecules, social networks, recommendation systems, and transportation, among
other domains. Data in multi-tabular relational databases can also be
constructed as 'relational entity graphs' for Relational Deep Learning (RDL) -
a new blueprint that enables end-to-end representation learning without
traditional feature engineering. Compared to arbitrary graph-structured data,
relational entity graphs have key properties: (i) their structure is defined by
primary-foreign key relationships between entities in different tables, (ii)
the structural connectivity is a function of the relational schema defining a
database, and (iii) the graph connectivity is temporal and heterogeneous in
nature. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of RDL by first
introducing the representation of relational databases as relational entity
graphs, and then reviewing public benchmark datasets that have been used to
develop and evaluate recent GNN-based RDL models. We discuss key challenges
including large-scale multi-table integration and the complexities of modeling
temporal dynamics and heterogeneous data, while also surveying foundational
neural network methods and recent architectural advances specialized for
relational entity graphs. Finally, we explore opportunities to unify these
distinct modeling challenges, highlighting how RDL converges multiple
sub-fields in graph machine learning towards the design of foundation models
that can transform the processing of relational data.

Abstract: Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of
generative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention
due to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering
applications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and
discretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier
Neural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and
rectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the
Mesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and
cross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and
discretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.
This advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse
applications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO
provides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general
advanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of
standardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional
generative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.

Method: 采用列归一化梯度和最后一层动量，提出SCALE优化器。

Result: SCALE在LLaMA模型上性能优于Adam，内存使用仅为35-45%，且优于其他高效优化器。

Conclusion: SCALE是内存受限下大规模预训练的理想选择，并为优化器设计提供了简约基线。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers
such as Adam, which require significant memory to maintain first- and
second-moment matrices, known as optimizer states. While recent works such as
GaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce
memory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount
of optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art
performance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate
this question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and
compute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)
column-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of
plain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only
to the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance
competitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,
we propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new
optimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where
column normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output
dimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the
performance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also
consistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and
APOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory
constraints. For the LLaMA 7B model, SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art
method APOLLO in terms of both perplexity and memory consumption. In addition,
our method serves as a minimalist baseline for more sophisticated optimizer
design.

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强、可扩展性好，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often use large, high-quality datasets to achieve high
performance on many machine learning tasks. When training involves potentially
sensitive data, this process can raise privacy concerns, as large models have
been shown to unintentionally memorize and reveal sensitive information,
including reconstructing entire training samples. Differential privacy (DP)
provides a robust framework for protecting individual data and in particular, a
new approach to privately training deep neural networks is to approximate the
input dataset with a privately generated synthetic dataset, before any
subsequent training algorithm. We introduce a novel principled method for DP
synthetic image embedding generation, based on fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) in an appropriate embedding space using DP clustering. Our method
provably learns a GMM under separation conditions. Empirically, a simple
two-layer neural network trained on synthetically generated embeddings achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracy on standard benchmark datasets.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can generate realistic synthetic
images that achieve downstream classification accuracy comparable to SOTA
methods. Our method is quite general, as the encoder and decoder modules can be
freely substituted to suit different tasks. It is also highly scalable,
consisting only of subroutines that scale linearly with the number of samples
and/or can be implemented efficiently in distributed systems.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in offline RL. However, these
methods often suffer from high training costs and slow convergence,
particularly when using transformer-based denoising backbones. While several
optimization strategies have been proposed -- such as modified noise schedules,
auxiliary prediction targets, and adaptive loss weighting -- challenges remain
in achieving stable and efficient training. In particular, existing loss
weighting functions typically rely on neural network approximators, which can
be ineffective in early training phases due to limited generalization capacity
of MLPs when exposed to sparse feedback in the early training stages. In this
work, we derive a variationally optimal uncertainty-aware weighting function
and introduce a closed-form polynomial approximation method for its online
estimation under the flow-based generative modeling framework. We integrate our
method into a diffusion planning pipeline and evaluate it on standard offline
RL benchmarks. Experimental results on Maze2D and Kitchen tasks show that our
method achieves competitive performance with up to 10 times fewer training
steps, highlighting its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Sequence-based recommendations models are driving the state-of-the-art for
industrial ad-recommendation systems. Such systems typically deal with user
histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4)
events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained
models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due
to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we
propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a
compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a
collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by
introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ
fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into
a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding
conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding
collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup
table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which
generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed
enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system
achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in
data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了领域泛化的一个基本问题：给定一组领域（数据分布），需要从多少随机采样的领域收集数据才能学习一个在所有领域（包括未见过的）上表现良好的模型。作者在PAC框架下建模此问题，并提出了一个新的组合度量——领域破碎维度，证明了该维度决定了领域样本复杂度。此外，作者还建立了领域破碎维度与经典VC维度的定量关系，表明所有在标准PAC设置下可学习的假设类在此设置下也可学习。

Method: 在PAC框架下引入新的组合度量——领域破碎维度，并分析其与领域样本复杂度的关系。

Result: 证明了领域破碎维度决定了领域样本复杂度，并建立了其与VC维度的定量关系。

Conclusion: 所有在标准PAC设置下可学习的假设类在领域泛化设置下也可学习，领域破碎维度是关键度量。

Abstract: We study a fundamental question of domain generalization: given a family of
domains (i.e., data distributions), how many randomly sampled domains do we
need to collect data from in order to learn a model that performs reasonably
well on every seen and unseen domain in the family? We model this problem in
the PAC framework and introduce a new combinatorial measure, which we call the
domain shattering dimension. We show that this dimension characterizes the
domain sample complexity. Furthermore, we establish a tight quantitative
relationship between the domain shattering dimension and the classic VC
dimension, demonstrating that every hypothesis class that is learnable in the
standard PAC setting is also learnable in our setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriCon-SF是一种新型的串行联邦学习框架，通过三重随机化和贡献感知技术解决数据异构性和隐私安全问题，在非独立同分布医疗数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决串行联邦学习中模型直接传输导致的隐私泄露和恶意客户端攻击问题，特别是在医疗等隐私敏感领域。

Method: TriCon-SF结合三重随机化（模型层、数据段、训练顺序）和Shapley值方法，增强隐私保护和系统问责。

Result: 在非独立同分布医疗数据上，TriCon-SF在准确性和通信效率上优于标准串行和并行联邦学习。

Conclusion: TriCon-SF通过创新设计有效提升了联邦学习的隐私保护和鲁棒性，适用于隐私敏感场景。

Abstract: Serial pipeline training is an efficient paradigm for handling data
heterogeneity in cross-silo federated learning with low communication overhead.
However, even without centralized aggregation, direct transfer of models
between clients can violate privacy regulations and remain susceptible to
gradient leakage and linkage attacks. Additionally, ensuring resilience against
semi-honest or malicious clients who may manipulate or misuse received models
remains a grand challenge, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose TriCon-SF, a novel serial
federated learning framework that integrates triple shuffling and contribution
awareness. TriCon-SF introduces three levels of randomization by shuffling
model layers, data segments, and training sequences to break deterministic
learning patterns and disrupt potential attack vectors, thereby enhancing
privacy and robustness. In parallel, it leverages Shapley value methods to
dynamically evaluate client contributions during training, enabling the
detection of dishonest behavior and enhancing system accountability. Extensive
experiments on non-IID healthcare datasets demonstrate that TriCon-SF
outperforms standard serial and parallel federated learning in both accuracy
and communication efficiency. Security analysis further supports its resilience
against client-side privacy attacks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了无监督组合优化（UCO）中训练与测试的不对齐问题，提出通过将可微分的去随机化引入训练来改善对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UCO方法中，训练与测试存在不对齐问题，导致训练损失低不一定带来更好的去随机化性能。

Method: 在训练中引入可微分的去随机化方法，以改善训练与测试的对齐性。

Result: 初步实验表明该方法能改善对齐性，但也带来训练挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为UCO中训练与测试对齐提供了新思路，但需进一步解决训练中的挑战。

Abstract: In unsupervised combinatorial optimization (UCO), during training, one aims
to have continuous decisions that are promising in a probabilistic sense for
each training instance, which enables end-to-end training on initially discrete
and non-differentiable problems. At the test time, for each test instance,
starting from continuous decisions, derandomization is typically applied to
obtain the final deterministic decisions. Researchers have developed more and
more powerful test-time derandomization schemes to enhance the empirical
performance and the theoretical guarantee of UCO methods. However, we notice a
misalignment between training and testing in the existing UCO methods.
Consequently, lower training losses do not necessarily entail better
post-derandomization performance, even for the training instances without any
data distribution shift. Empirically, we indeed observe such undesirable cases.
We explore a preliminary idea to better align training and testing in UCO by
including a differentiable version of derandomization into training. Our
empirical exploration shows that such an idea indeed improves training-test
alignment, but also introduces nontrivial challenges into training.

Method: 利用对偶空间中的几何视角，分析迭代过程中能量函数的有界性。

Conclusion: 乐观虚构博弈在无正则化情况下仍能实现最优性能，而交替虚构博弈则无法达到次线性后悔。

Abstract: This paper studies the optimistic variant of Fictitious Play for learning in
two-player zero-sum games. While it is known that Optimistic FTRL -- a
regularized algorithm with a bounded stepsize parameter -- obtains constant
regret in this setting, we show for the first time that similar, optimal rates
are also achievable without regularization: we prove for two-strategy games
that Optimistic Fictitious Play (using any tiebreaking rule) obtains only
constant regret, providing surprising new evidence on the ability of
non-no-regret algorithms for fast learning in games. Our proof technique
leverages a geometric view of Optimistic Fictitious Play in the dual space of
payoff vectors, where we show a certain energy function of the iterates remains
bounded over time. Additionally, we also prove a regret lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for Alternating Fictitious Play. In the unregularized
regime, this separates the ability of optimism and alternation in achieving
$o(\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Motivation: 解决传统人机接口依赖单一生物信号模态的局限性，探索多模态融合在神经科学和辅助技术（如假肢）中的应用潜力。

Method: 系统比较了三种架构（多模态MLP、多模态Transformer和分层Transformer）的线性与注意力融合策略，并在两个公开数据集上评估性能。

Result: 分层Transformer结合注意力融合在两个数据集上均表现最佳，准确率分别超过基线10%和3.7%，且跨模态交互贡献了约30%的决策信号。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态融合在生物信号分类中的优势，为神经机器人系统的传感器设计提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Hand gestures are a primary output of the human motor system, yet the
decoding of their neuromuscular signatures remains a bottleneck for basic
neuroscience and assistive technologies such as prosthetics. Traditional
human-machine interface pipelines rely on a single biosignal modality, but
multimodal fusion can exploit complementary information from sensors. We
systematically compare linear and attention-based fusion strategies across
three architectures: a Multimodal MLP, a Multimodal Transformer, and a
Hierarchical Transformer, evaluating performance on scenarios with unimodal and
multimodal inputs. Experiments use two publicly available datasets: NinaPro DB2
(sEMG and accelerometer) and HD-sEMG 65-Gesture (high-density sEMG and force).
Across both datasets, the Hierarchical Transformer with attention-based fusion
consistently achieved the highest accuracy, surpassing the multimodal and best
single-modality linear-fusion MLP baseline by over 10% on NinaPro DB2 and 3.7%
on HD-sEMG. To investigate how modalities interact, we introduce an Isolation
Network that selectively silences unimodal or cross-modal attention pathways,
quantifying each group of token interactions' contribution to downstream
decisions. Ablations reveal that cross-modal interactions contribute
approximately 30% of the decision signal across transformer layers,
highlighting the importance of attention-driven fusion in harnessing
complementary modality information. Together, these findings reveal when and
how multimodal fusion would enhance biosignal classification and also provides
mechanistic insights of human muscle activities. The study would be beneficial
in the design of sensor arrays for neurorobotic systems.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了对抗学习中的效率问题，为离策略方法的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, robust reinforcement learning (RL) methods designed to handle
adversarial input observations have received significant attention, motivated
by RL's inherent vulnerabilities. While existing approaches have demonstrated
reasonable success, addressing worst-case scenarios over long time horizons
requires both minimizing the agent's cumulative rewards for adversaries and
training agents to counteract them through alternating learning. However, this
process introduces mutual dependencies between the agent and the adversary,
making interactions with the environment inefficient and hindering the
development of off-policy methods. In this work, we propose a novel off-policy
method that eliminates the need for additional environmental interactions by
reformulating adversarial learning as a soft-constrained optimization problem.
Our approach is theoretically supported by the symmetric property of policy
evaluation between the agent and the adversary. The implementation is available
at https://github.com/nakanakakosuke/VALT_SAC.

Motivation: 现有双曲异构图嵌入模型仅依赖单一双曲空间，难以捕捉异构图的多样性幂律结构。

Result: 实验表明MHCL在多种图机器学习任务中优于现有基线。

Conclusion: MHCL通过多双曲空间和对比学习，有效提升了异构图嵌入的性能。

Abstract: The hyperbolic space, characterized by a constant negative curvature and
exponentially expanding space, aligns well with the structural properties of
heterogeneous graphs. However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess
diverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding
models rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively
capture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To
address this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive
Learning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture
diverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by
learning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex
structures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic
information effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic
information, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating
them to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning
approach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath
embeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the
distance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance
between those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the
separability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The
experimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the
complex structures of heterogeneous graphs.

Conclusion: 多元平等框架能更全面地解决机器学习系统中的分配性和代表性危害。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of
research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And
why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly
appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,
such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally
distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because
they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive
focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading
ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that
equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging
structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that
privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality
manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,
economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While
distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why
representational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce
social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --
and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals
(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a
multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both
distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political
philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for
tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also
outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML
pipeline.

Result: 实验表明，SeLoRA在减少参数的同时提高了效率，并在多个下游任务中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: SeLoRA是一种可扩展的即插即用框架，能有效提升LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large foundation models. Despite its successes, the substantial
parameter redundancy, which limits the capacity and efficiency of LoRA, has
been recognized as a bottleneck. In this work, we systematically investigate
the impact of redundancy in fine-tuning LoRA and reveal that reducing density
redundancy does not degrade expressiveness. Based on this insight, we introduce
\underline{S}pectral-\underline{e}ncoding \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank
\underline{A}daptation (SeLoRA), which harnesses the robust expressiveness of
spectral bases to re-parameterize LoRA from a sparse spectral subspace.
Designed with simplicity, SeLoRA enables seamless integration with various LoRA
variants for performance boosting, serving as a scalable plug-and-play
framework. Extensive experiments substantiate that SeLoRA achieves greater
efficiency with fewer parameters, delivering superior performance enhancements
over strong baselines on various downstream tasks, including commonsense
reasoning, math reasoning, and code generation.

Motivation: GNNs在深度增加时性能下降，现有初始化方法无法同时控制信号传播的三个关键指标。

Method: 提出SPoGInit方法，通过优化前向传播、反向传播和图嵌入变化（GEV）三个指标来改进初始化。

Result: SPoGInit在多种任务和架构上优于常用初始化方法，且能随着GNNs深度增加提升性能。

Conclusion: SPoGInit有效解决了GNNs深度相关挑战，验证了信号传播分析框架的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from performance degradation as the
network depth increases. This paper addresses this issue by introducing
initialization methods that enhance signal propagation (SP) within GNNs. We
propose three key metrics for effective SP in GNNs: forward propagation,
backward propagation, and graph embedding variation (GEV). While the first two
metrics derive from classical SP theory, the third is specifically designed for
GNNs. We theoretically demonstrate that a broad range of commonly used
initialization methods for GNNs, which exhibit performance degradation with
increasing depth, fail to control these three metrics simultaneously. To deal
with this limitation, a direct exploitation of the SP analysis--searching for
weight initialization variances that optimize the three metrics--is shown to
significantly enhance the SP in deep GCNs. This approach is called Signal
Propagation on Graph-guided Initialization (SPoGInit). Our experiments
demonstrate that SPoGInit outperforms commonly used initialization methods on
various tasks and architectures. Notably, SPoGInit enables performance
improvements as GNNs deepen, which represents a significant advancement in
addressing depth-related challenges and highlights the validity and
effectiveness of the SP analysis framework.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep learning and foundation models for
tabular data, the need for standardized and reliable benchmarks is higher than
ever. However, current benchmarks are static. Their design is not updated even
if flaws are discovered, model versions are updated, or new models are
released. To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously
maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually
curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models,
conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard,
and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the
influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations
to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are
still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep
learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At
the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show
that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine
learning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch
TabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance
protocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai.

Conclusion: seq2GMM能有效识别异常时间序列，并提供决策解释，适用于网络时间序列数据库。

Abstract: Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of
physical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The
quasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar
repetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in
different lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude
of such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to
identify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the
observations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how
the decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model
(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify
unusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We
further develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently
train the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a
plurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the
convergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical
results to substantiate our theoretical claims.

Abstract: Due to an exponential increase in published research articles, it is
impossible for individual scientists to read all publications, even within
their own research field. In this work, we investigate the use of large
language models (LLMs) for the purpose of extracting the main concepts and
semantic information from scientific abstracts in the domain of materials
science to find links that were not noticed by humans and thus to suggest
inspiring near/mid-term future research directions. We show that LLMs can
extract concepts more efficiently than automated keyword extraction methods to
build a concept graph as an abstraction of the scientific literature. A machine
learning model is trained to predict emerging combinations of concepts, i.e.
new research ideas, based on historical data. We demonstrate that integrating
semantic concept information leads to an increased prediction performance. The
applicability of our model is demonstrated in qualitative interviews with
domain experts based on individualized model suggestions. We show that the
model can inspire materials scientists in their creative thinking process by
predicting innovative combinations of topics that have not yet been
investigated.

Conclusion: FedFitTech为FitTech领域的研究和开发提供了开源基础。

Abstract: Rapid evolution of sensors and resource-efficient machine learning models
have spurred the widespread adoption of wearable fitness tracking devices.
Equipped with inertial sensors, such devices can continuously capture physical
movements for fitness technology (FitTech), enabling applications from sports
optimization to preventive healthcare. Traditional centralized learning
approaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,
regulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies. In contrast,
Federated Learning (FL) enables a decentralized model training by communicating
model updates rather than private wearable sensor data. Applying FL to FitTech
presents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,
heterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization
and generalization. To simplify research on FitTech in FL, we present the
FedFitTech baseline, under the Flower framework, which is publicly available
and widely used by both industry and academic researchers. Additionally, to
illustrate its usage, this paper presents a case study that implements a system
based on the FedFitTech baseline, incorporating a client-side early stopping
strategy and comparing the results. For instance, this system allows wearable
devices to optimize the trade-off between capturing common fitness activity
patterns and preserving individuals' nuances, thereby enhancing both the
scalability and efficiency of privacy-aware fitness tracking applications.
Results show that this reduces overall redundant communications by 13 percent,
while maintaining the overall recognition performance at a negligible
recognition cost by 1 percent. Thus, FedFitTech baseline creates a foundation
for a wide range of new research and development opportunities in FitTech, and
it is available as open-source at:

Conclusion: 新带宽选择方法显著提升SPBNs性能，适用于实际数据。

Abstract: Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and
non-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex
data distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators
(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of
data normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the
KDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the
trade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates
from normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and
reduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical
framework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and
subsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the
approaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their
effectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.
To support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package
PyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and
conducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively
than the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.
In particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,
highlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.

Result: 在15个数据集上，SST在判别和校准指标上优于三种基准生存树模型。

Conclusion: SST在灵活性和可解释性上表现优异，并可扩展至群体公平性考虑。

Abstract: Decision trees are popular in survival analysis for their interpretability
and ability to model complex relationships. Survival trees, which predict the
timing of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built
through heuristic approaches. Recently, there has been growing interest in
globally optimized trees, where the overall tree is trained by minimizing the
error function over all its parameters. We propose a new soft survival tree
model (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a
nonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs
provide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a
single leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit
the related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with
interpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or
nonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf
node of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are
associated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15
well-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based
semiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the
node-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al. (2024) for soft
regression trees, outperform three benchmark survival trees in terms of four
widely-used discrimination and calibration measures. SSTs can also be extended
to consider group fairness.

Result: RATTPO在多种奖励设置下表现优异，搜索效率高，推理预算节省3.5倍，性能接近需微调的学习基线。

Conclusion: RATTPO是一种高效通用的提示优化方法，适用于多样化奖励场景，显著提升生成效果。

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image
(T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function
specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating
image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically
target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs
exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios
involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce
RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time
optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without
modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying
large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task
descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel
reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results
demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts
across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as
aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects.
RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using
up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget,
achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require
reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为事件触发时间序列的相似性建模提供了系统化方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Time series analysis has achieved great success in cyber security such as
intrusion detection and device identification. Learning similarities among
multiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for
downstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the
event-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric
is appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and
clustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised
learning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of
event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the
proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution
sequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively
learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the
obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation. The
proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a
systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of
event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods considerably.

Motivation: 确定神经网络的最佳深度是一个基础但具有挑战性的问题，通常需要通过资源密集型实验解决。本文旨在通过理论框架解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 本文的理论和实证结果表明，通过最优停止框架和正则化方法，可以在不牺牲准确性的情况下显著提高计算效率。

Abstract: Determining the optimal depth of a neural network is a fundamental yet
challenging problem, typically resolved through resource-intensive
experimentation. This paper introduces a formal theoretical framework to
address this question by recasting the forward pass of a deep network,
specifically a Residual Network (ResNet), as an optimal stopping problem. We
model the layer-by-layer evolution of hidden representations as a sequential
decision process where, at each layer, a choice is made between halting
computation to make a prediction or continuing to a deeper layer for a
potentially more refined representation. This formulation captures the
intrinsic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our primary
theoretical contribution is a proof that, under a plausible condition of
diminishing returns on the residual functions, the expected optimal stopping
depth is provably finite, even in an infinite-horizon setting. We leverage this
insight to propose a novel and practical regularization term, $\mathcal{L}_{\rm
depth}$, that encourages the network to learn representations amenable to
efficient, early exiting. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by
extending it to the Transformer architecture and exploring its connection to
continuous-depth models via free-boundary problems. Empirical validation on
ImageNet confirms that our regularizer successfully induces the theoretically
predicted behavior, leading to significant gains in computational efficiency
without compromising, and in some cases improving, final model accuracy.

Result: 发现高特征学习仅对高度相似任务有益，并识别了任务相似性调制的过渡点。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特征学习的临界水平上达到最佳性能，该水平取决于任务非平稳性，并跨模型规模转移。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts, neural networks still struggle to learn in
non-stationary environments, and our understanding of catastrophic forgetting
(CF) is far from complete. In this work, we perform a systematic study on the
impact of model scale and the degree of feature learning in continual learning.
We reconcile existing contradictory observations on scale in the literature, by
differentiating between lazy and rich training regimes through a variable
parameterization of the architecture. We show that increasing model width is
only beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more
laziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the
infinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and
characterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy
regime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task
non-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only
beneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by
task similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low
forgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting. Finally, our
findings reveal that neural networks achieve optimal performance at a critical
level of feature learning, which depends on task non-stationarity and transfers
across model scales. This work provides a unified perspective on the role of
scale and feature learning in continual learning.

Motivation: 传统手动检测质量问题的成本高且易出错，机器学习有潜力替代，但现有方法在低数据质量和实际工业环境中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 评估了两种先进模型，用于识别和改进生产数据中的质量问题，无需新数据，并提供了识别模型或数据问题的指导。

Result: 提出了一个框架，用于更准确地估计实际场景中的经验风险，并指出了基于似然方法的常见缺陷。

Conclusion: 论文为实践者提供了改进模型和数据质量的指导，并提出了更适合实际工业场景的风险估计框架。

Abstract: The detection and localization of quality-related problems in industrially
mass-produced products has historically relied on manual inspection, which is
costly and error-prone. Machine learning has the potential to replace manual
handling. As such, the desire is to facilitate an unsupervised (or
self-supervised) approach, as it is often impossible to specify all conceivable
defects ahead of time. A plethora of prior works have demonstrated the aptitude
of common reconstruction-, embedding-, and synthesis-based methods in
laboratory settings. However, in practice, we observe that most methods do not
handle low data quality well or exude low robustness in unfavorable, but
typical real-world settings. For practitioners it may be very difficult to
identify the actual underlying problem when such methods underperform. Worse,
often-reported metrics (e.g., AUROC) are rarely suitable in practice and may
give misleading results. In our setting, we attempt to identify subtle
anomalies on the surface of blasted forged metal parts, using rather
low-quality RGB imagery only, which is a common industrial setting. We
specifically evaluate two types of state-of-the-art models that allow us to
identify and improve quality issues in production data, without having to
obtain new data. Our contribution is to provide guardrails for practitioners
that allow them to identify problems related to, e.g., (lack of) robustness or
invariance, in either the chosen model or the data reliably in similar
scenarios. Furthermore, we exemplify common pitfalls in and shortcomings of
likelihood-based approaches and outline a framework for proper empirical risk
estimation that is more suitable for real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 新生儿死亡率高，早期预测可降低死亡风险。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、KNN、随机森林、XGBoost、CNN和LSTM等算法，基于140万新生儿历史数据训练模型。

Result: XGBoost和随机森林准确率为94%，LSTM达99%。

Conclusion: LSTM是最适合预测新生儿死亡风险的模型。

Abstract: Neonatal death is still a concerning reality for underdeveloped and even some
developed countries. Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000
births die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction
of endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to
take ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be
avoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a
newborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4
million newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such
as logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term
memory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate
model for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,
XGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while
among the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.
Therefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict
whether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.

Result: 在33个数据集上验证，深度堆叠显著提升性能，同时减少运行时间和特征维度。

Conclusion: RocketStack通过修剪和压缩实现了高效深度集成，为机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking
used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.
However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal
diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and
computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware
recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking
levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally
prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without
excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian
noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against
strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions
are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)
filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),
linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and
the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the
strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild
OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the
strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no
compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached
98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing
runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.
These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and
periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets
in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive
ensembling with tractable complexity.

Result: 新算法在合成和实际任务中均能生成更高质量和多样性的候选。

Conclusion: 研究为离散组合生成任务提供了灵活的新视角。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in scientific discovery involves narrowing a large
combinatorial set of objects, such as proteins or molecules, to a small set of
promising candidates. While this process largely relies on expert knowledge,
recent methods leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance this filtering.
They achieve this by estimating proxy reward functions from available datasets
and using regularization to generate more diverse candidates. These reward
functions are inherently uncertain, raising a particularly salient challenge
for scientific discovery. In this work, we show that existing methods, often
framed as sampling proportional to a reward function, are inadequate and yield
suboptimal candidates, especially in large search spaces. To remedy this issue,
we take a robust RL approach and introduce a unified operator that seeks
robustness to the uncertainty of the proxy reward function. This general
operator targets peakier sampling distributions while encompassing known soft
RL operators. It also leads us to a novel algorithm that identifies
higher-quality, diverse candidates in both synthetic and real-world tasks.
Ultimately, our work offers a new, flexible perspective on discrete
compositional generation tasks. Code: https://github.com/marcojira/tgm.

Abstract: With the growing adoption of AI image generation, in conjunction with the
ever-increasing environmental resources demanded by AI, we are urged to answer
a fundamental question: What is the environmental impact hidden behind each
image we generate? In this research, we present a comprehensive empirical
experiment designed to assess the energy consumption of AI image generation.
Our experiment compares 17 state-of-the-art image generation models by
considering multiple factors that could affect their energy consumption, such
as model quantization, image resolution, and prompt length. Additionally, we
consider established image quality metrics to study potential trade-offs
between energy consumption and generated image quality. Results show that image
generation models vary drastically in terms of the energy they consume, with up
to a 46x difference. Image resolution affects energy consumption
inconsistently, ranging from a 1.3x to 4.7x increase when doubling resolution.
U-Net-based models tend to consume less than Transformer-based one. Model
quantization instead results to deteriorate the energy efficiency of most
models, while prompt length and content have no statistically significant
impact. Improving image quality does not always come at the cost of a higher
energy consumption, with some of the models producing the highest quality
images also being among the most energy efficient ones.

Conclusion: MARL-OD-DA框架在可扩展性和可靠性方面表现优异，为大规模交通分配问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of metropolitan cities and the increase in travel demands
impose stringent requirements on traffic assignment methods. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches outperform traditional methods in
modeling adaptive routing behavior without requiring explicit system dynamics,
which is beneficial for real-world deployment. However, MARL frameworks face
challenges in scalability and reliability when managing extensive networks with
substantial travel demand, which limiting their practical applicability in
solving large-scale traffic assignment problems. To address these challenges,
this study introduces MARL-OD-DA, a new MARL framework for the traffic
assignment problem, which redefines agents as origin-destination (OD) pair
routers rather than individual travelers, significantly enhancing scalability.
Additionally, a Dirichlet-based action space with action pruning and a reward
function based on the local relative gap are designed to enhance solution
reliability and improve convergence efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that
the proposed MARL framework effectively handles medium-sized networks with
extensive and varied city-level OD demand, surpassing existing MARL methods.
When implemented in the SiouxFalls network, MARL-OD-DA achieves better
assignment solutions in 10 steps, with a relative gap that is 94.99% lower than
that of conventional methods.

Result: 发现公平性指标碎片化，临床验证有限，且缺乏临床实用性指标。

Abstract: Predictive artificial intelligence (AI) offers an opportunity to improve
clinical practice and patient outcomes, but risks perpetuating biases if
fairness is inadequately addressed. However, the definition of "fairness"
remains unclear. We conducted a scoping review to identify and critically
appraise fairness metrics for clinical predictive AI. We defined a "fairness
metric" as a measure quantifying whether a model discriminates (societally)
against individuals or groups defined by sensitive attributes. We searched five
databases (2014-2024), screening 820 records, to include 41 studies, and
extracted 62 fairness metrics. Metrics were classified by
performance-dependency, model output level, and base performance metric,
revealing a fragmented landscape with limited clinical validation and
overreliance on threshold-dependent measures. Eighteen metrics were explicitly
developed for healthcare, including only one clinical utility metric. Our
findings highlight conceptual challenges in defining and quantifying fairness
and identify gaps in uncertainty quantification, intersectionality, and
real-world applicability. Future work should prioritise clinically meaningful
metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松集成到学习框架中，为涉及不完整或不规则数据的机器学习方法提供频谱指导。

Abstract: Time series with missing or irregularly sampled data are a persistent
challenge in machine learning. Many methods operate on the frequency-domain,
relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling,
therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that
enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled
data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD)
for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method
recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while
simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method
can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of
spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or
irregular data.

transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the
CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The
resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011,
2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic.
  To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods,
including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are
compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical
results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally
static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In
contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing
improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic
benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets
with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model
implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and
reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有签名提取方法在深度网络中的局限性（如秩不足和噪声传播），提出改进方案。

Method: 提出高效算法解决秩不足和噪声传播问题，优化签名提取过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上成功提取八层网络，准确率至少95%，远超之前方法的三层限制。

Conclusion: 该方法为攻击更大、更复杂的神经网络架构提供了关键进展。

Abstract: Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important
security concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via
black-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which
aims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.
Prior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired
by differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,
their method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability
to networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign
extraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction
itself was feasible.
  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by
systematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical
limitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations
include rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome
these challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the
identified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.
Our approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously
possible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based
neural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and
accuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at
least 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network
trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the
first three layers. Our results represent a crucial step toward practical
attacks on larger and more complex neural network architectures.

Motivation: 多变量时间序列中的因果关系分析在金融和神经科学等领域至关重要，但现有方法无法处理非平稳性和复杂噪声分布。

Method: FANTOM使用贝叶斯期望最大化算法，同时推断多个因果结构及其边界，并学习每个因果结构的DAG。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，FANTOM在非平稳和非高斯噪声条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FANTOM为复杂时间序列的因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in
many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many
such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments
with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal
structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for
analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this
setting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have
its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,
which may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery
approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity
or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified
framework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with
non Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the
number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's
Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm
that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the
theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal
heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are
identifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,
extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms
existing methods.

Conclusion: 研究解决了PNNs神经变种的预期维度猜想，并提供了激活度所需的新界限。

Abstract: Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) possess a rich algebraic and geometric
structure. However, their identifiability -- a key property for ensuring
interpretability -- remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the identifiability of deep PNNs, including
architectures with and without bias terms. Our results reveal an intricate
interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving
identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with
non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,
while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not
grow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection
between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type
uniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the
architecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.
We also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's
neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for
it to reach its maximum.

Abstract: Trust is emerging as an effective tool to ensure the successful completion of
collaborative tasks within collaborative systems. However, rapidly and
continuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task
execution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex
operational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust
evaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,
the communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a
trusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and
represented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures
trust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison
with data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,
the collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as
task completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with
an ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,
consisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to
learn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.
Finally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is
calculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A
real system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to
test the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results
demonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and
achieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline
algorithm.

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了扩散模型在模拟中的一致性，并实现了高效采样。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention due to their
effectiveness in various scientific domains, including biochemistry. When
trained on equilibrium molecular distributions, diffusion models provide both:
a generative procedure to sample equilibrium conformations and associated
forces derived from the model's scores. However, using the forces for
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations uncovers inconsistencies in the
samples generated via classical diffusion inference and simulation, despite
both originating from the same model. Particularly at the small diffusion
timesteps required for simulations, diffusion models fail to satisfy the
Fokker-Planck equation, which governs how the score should evolve over time. We
interpret this deviation as an indication of the observed inconsistencies and
propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived
regularization term enforcing consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on toy systems, alanine dipeptide, and introduce a
state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports
simulation and demonstrates enhanced consistency and efficient sampling.

Conclusion: Sparse-Reg有效解决了小数据集下的过拟合问题，提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of small datasets in the context of
offline reinforcement learning (RL). While many common offline RL benchmarks
employ datasets with over a million data points, many offline RL applications
rely on considerably smaller datasets. We show that offline RL algorithms can
overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor performance. To address this
challenge, we introduce "Sparse-Reg": a regularization technique based on
sparsity to mitigate overfitting in offline reinforcement learning, enabling
effective learning in limited data settings and outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in continuous control.

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical perspective that views deep
generative models as probability transformation functions. Despite the apparent
differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of
generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial
networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we
demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple
predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying
perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between
model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal
theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective
generative modeling techniques.

TL;DR: DISCoVeR是一种新的变分框架，用于在多条件设置中分离条件不变和条件特定的因素，通过双潜在架构和最大最小目标实现更好的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学数据分析等领域，需要分离稳定信号和上下文依赖效应以推广到新条件，现有VAE方法存在泄漏问题。

Method: DISCoVeR采用双潜在架构、并行重建和最大最小目标，无需手工先验即可实现解耦。

Result: 在合成数据集、自然图像和单细胞RNA-seq数据上，DISCoVeR表现出更好的解耦性能。

Conclusion: DISCoVeR为多条件设置中的解耦表示学习提供了理论支持和实证效果。

Abstract: Disentangled representations enable models to separate factors of variation
that are shared across experimental conditions from those that are
condition-specific. This separation is essential in domains such as biomedical
data analysis, where generalization to new treatments, patients, or species
depends on isolating stable biological signals from context-dependent effects.
While extensions of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework have been
proposed to address this problem, they frequently suffer from leakage between
latent representations, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen
conditions. Here, we introduce DISCoVeR, a new variational framework that
explicitly separates condition-invariant and condition-specific factors.
DISCoVeR integrates three key components: (i) a dual-latent architecture that
models shared and specific factors separately; (ii) two parallel
reconstructions that ensure both representations remain informative; and (iii)
a novel max-min objective that encourages clean separation without relying on
handcrafted priors, while making only minimal assumptions. Theoretically, we
show that this objective maximizes data likelihood while promoting
disentanglement, and that it admits a unique equilibrium. Empirically, we
demonstrate that DISCoVeR achieves improved disentanglement on synthetic
datasets, natural images, and single-cell RNA-seq data. Together, these results
establish DISCoVeR as a principled approach for learning disentangled
representations in multi-condition settings.

Result: 获得了泛化误差的紧下界，并找到了在某些条件下达到该下界的最优凸隐式偏差。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下，最优凸隐式偏差能够实现最佳泛化性能。

Abstract: Most modern learning problems are over-parameterized, where the number of
learnable parameters is much greater than the number of training data points.
In this over-parameterized regime, the training loss typically has infinitely
many global optima that completely interpolate the data with varying
generalization performance. The particular global optimum we converge to
depends on the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm. The question we
address in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best
generalization performance?". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a
precise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators
obtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for
over-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In
particular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error
possible among this class of interpolators in terms of the
over-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the
eigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the
parameter to be estimated. Finally, we find the optimal convex implicit bias
that achieves this lower bound under certain sufficient conditions involving
the log-concavity of the distribution of a Gaussian convolved with the prior of
the true underlying parameter.

Result: 稀疏网络在参数效率和优化稳定性上优于密集网络，且在视觉和流式强化学习场景中表现一致。

Conclusion: 静态网络稀疏性是一种简单有效的方法，可显著提升深度强化学习模型的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven
notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating
various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural
advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex
modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can
unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with
state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random
pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly
removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively
scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher
parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to
optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We
further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios,
demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.

TL;DR: 论文提出BREAD方法，通过部分专家指导和分支展开，解决了小语言模型在SFT + RL范式中的局限性，显著提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLM）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是高质量训练数据稀缺时。传统SFT + RL方法存在局限性，如专家轨迹难以表达或模型初始化成功率极低。

Method: 提出BREAD方法，结合GRPO，通过部分专家指导和分支展开，自适应插入专家提示，确保每次更新至少包含一条成功轨迹。

Result: BREAD仅需不到40%的真实轨迹，性能优于标准GRPO，训练速度提升约3倍，并能解决SFT + RL无法解决的问题。

Conclusion: BREAD通过分支展开和专家指导显著提升了SLM的推理能力，为小模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) struggle to learn complex reasoning behaviors,
especially when high-quality traces are scarce or difficult to learn from. The
standard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often
to distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning
(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose
methods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate
that the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are
too difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's
initialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,
we introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via
partial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,
BREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model
to complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update
includes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the
reward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer
than 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while
speeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that
BREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +
RL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can
substantially boost SLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于内部反馈的强化学习方法（RLIF），用于提升大型语言模型的推理能力，无需外部监督。实验表明RLIF在训练初期能显著提升性能，但随着训练深入，性能会下降甚至低于基线。此外，RLIF对已指令调优的模型效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如RLHF和RLVR）依赖外部监督，成本高且复杂。RLIF通过利用模型内部信号（如熵和自确定性）作为奖励代理，探索了一种无需外部监督的替代方案。

Method: RLIF利用无监督奖励代理（如词元级熵、轨迹级熵和自确定性）作为内部反馈信号。通过理论分析和实验验证，比较了不同RLIF策略在数学推理任务上的表现。

Result: RLIF在训练初期能显著提升模型推理性能，甚至超越RLVR方法。但随着训练深入，性能下降至低于基线水平。此外，RLIF对已指令调优的模型效果不明显。

Conclusion: RLIF为无需外部监督的模型优化提供了新思路，但其效果受训练阶段和模型状态影响。研究揭示了内部反馈的局限性，为未来LLM训练策略提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training
large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require
extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods,
Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on
intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we
leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,
trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows
these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate
various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs
at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques
on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even
below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little
improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of
intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze
this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's
training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal
feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback
will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖初始3D重建阶段，计算成本高且效果不佳，亟需一种更高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Result: VEIGAR在重建质量和跨视角一致性上达到新标杆，训练时间减少三倍。

Conclusion: VEIGAR在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，为NVS任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Novel View Synthesis (NVS) and 3D generation have
significantly improved editing tasks, with a primary emphasis on maintaining
cross-view consistency throughout the generative process. Contemporary methods
typically address this challenge using a dual-strategy framework: performing
consistent 2D inpainting across all views guided by embedded priors either
explicitly in pixel space or implicitly in latent space; and conducting 3D
reconstruction with additional consistency guidance. Previous strategies, in
particular, often require an initial 3D reconstruction phase to establish
geometric structure, introducing considerable computational overhead. Even with
the added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.
In this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that
outperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction
phase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors
explicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision
strategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for
traditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.
Through extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art
benchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving
a threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,
highlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Structural coloration is commonly modeled using wave optics for reliable and
photorealistic rendering of natural, quasi-periodic and complex nanostructures.
Such models often rely on dense, preliminary or preprocessed data to accurately
capture the nuanced variations in diffractive surface reflectances. This heavy
data dependency warrants implicit neural representation which has not been
addressed comprehensively in the current literature. In this paper, we present
a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based method for data-driven rendering of
diffractive surfaces with high accuracy and efficiency. We primarily approach
this problem from a data compression perspective to devise a nuanced training
and modeling method which is attuned to the domain and range characteristics of
diffractive reflectance datasets. Importantly, our approach avoids over-fitting
and has robust resampling behavior. Using Peak-Signal-to-Noise (PSNR),
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and a flipping difference evaluator
(FLIP) as evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the high-quality reconstruction of
the ground-truth. In comparison to a recent state-of-the-art offline,
wave-optical, forward modeling approach, our method reproduces subjectively
similar results with significant performance gains. We reduce the memory
footprint of the raw datasets by two orders of magnitude in general. Lastly, we
depict the working of our method with actual surface renderings.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经SDF的曲率代理方法，通过仅正则化混合二阶项（Weingarten项），降低计算成本，同时保持几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要计算完整的Hessian矩阵，导致内存和运行时成本高昂。

Method: 提出两种曲率代理实现：(i) 有限差分代理，(ii) 自动微分代理，均避免完整Hessian计算。

Result: 在ABC基准测试中，代理方法在重建精度上与基线相当或更优，同时减少GPU内存和运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为工程级形状重建提供了一种高效、可扩展的曲率感知SDF学习方案。

Abstract: Neural signed-distance fields (SDFs) have become a versatile backbone for
geometric learning, yet enforcing developable, CAD-style behavior still hinges
on Gaussian curvature penalties that require full Hessian evaluation and
second-order automatic differentiation, both of which are costly in memory and
runtime. We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed
second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to
adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary
instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces
each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order
gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative
via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and
remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second
derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full
second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the
reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory
use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and
framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware
SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.

Result: 方法能生成更高质量和多样性的图像，同时保持色彩一致性，并推广了现有PDE技术。

Conclusion: 该工作将流体动力学、PDE理论与深度学习结合，为基于扩散的图像合成提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a novel PDE-driven corruption process for generative image
synthesis based on advection-diffusion processes which generalizes existing
PDE-based approaches. Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a
physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic
diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet,
Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom
Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence,
we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and
capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns
to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel
generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of
our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based
corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and
quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette
unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and
deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed
image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.

Conclusion: DreamCube通过多平面同步技术有效扩展2D模型能力，生成高质量3D全景内容。

Abstract: 3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands
high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated
omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from
pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic
data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits
their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane
synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities
can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design,
we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D
panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to
achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D
scene generation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有硬件友好的去偏算法无法适应广泛的偏差变化（BV），因此需要一种能够补偿BV的熵源。

Method: 使用64x64阵列的pgSPADs，通过调整栅极电压补偿BV，并结合Von Neumann算法去偏。

Result: 在室温下，实现了小于1%的BV，并通过了NIST的16项统计测试。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了BV问题，生成了高质量的随机数。

Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements
suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient
debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options
depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV.
In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon
avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS
technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV
compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices'
native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit
generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased
using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits
were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于铯检测，还可推广到更复杂的放射性核素和其他数据类型（如脉冲质量、探测器位置等），具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a method to improve the detection limit for radionuclides using
spectroscopic radiation detectors and the arrival time of each detected
radiation quantum. We enable this method using a neural network with an
attention mechanism. We illustrate the method on the detection of Cesium
release from a nuclear facility during an upset, and our method shows $2\times$
improvement over the traditional spectroscopic method. We hypothesize that our
method achieves this performance increase by modulating its detection
probability by the overall rate of probable detections, specifically by
adapting detection thresholds based on temporal event distributions and local
spectral features, and show evidence to this effect. We believe this method is
applicable broadly and may be more successful for radionuclides with more
complicated decay chains than Cesium; we also note that our method can
generalize beyond the addition of arrival time and could integrate other data
about each detection event, such as pulse quality, location in detector, or
even combining the energy and time from detections in different detectors.

Abstract: In this article, we review modern approaches to building interpretable models
of property markets using machine learning on the base of mass valuation of
property in the Primorye region, Russia. The researcher, lacking expertise in
this topic, encounters numerous difficulties in the effort to build a good
model. The main source of this is the huge difference between noisy real market
data and ideal data which is very common in all types of tutorials on machine
learning. This paper covers all stages of modeling: the collection of initial
data, identification of outliers, the search and analysis of patterns in data,
the formation and final choice of price factors, the building of the model, and
the evaluation of its efficiency. For each stage, we highlight potential issues
and describe sound methods for overcoming emerging difficulties on actual
examples. We show that the combination of classical linear regression with
interpolation methods of geostatistics allows to build an effective model for
land parcels. For flats, when many objects are attributed to one spatial point
the application of geostatistical methods is difficult. Therefore we suggest
linear regression with automatic generation and selection of additional rules
on the base of decision trees, so called the RuleFit method. Thus we show, that
despite the strong restriction as the requirement of interpretability which is
important in practical aspects, for example, legal matters, it is still
possible to build effective models of real property markets.

Conclusion: TrainVerify为大规模分布式训练提供了高效且可靠的验证解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) at scale requires parallel execution
across thousands of devices, incurring enormous computational costs. Yet, these
costly distributed trainings are rarely verified, leaving them prone to silent
errors and potentially wasting millions of GPU hours. We introduce TrainVerify,
a system for verifiable distributed training of LLMs. Given a deep learning
model's logical specification as the ground truth, TrainVerify formally
verifies that a distributed parallel execution plan is mathematically
equivalent to it. Direct verification is notoriously difficult due to the sheer
scale of LLMs which often involves billions of variables and highly intricate
computation graphs. Therefore, TrainVerify introduces shape-reduction
techniques and a stage-wise parallel verification algorithm that significantly
reduces complexity while preserving formal correctness. TrainVerify scales to
frontier LLMs, including the successful verification of the Llama3 (405B) and
DeepSeek-V3 (671B) training plans.

LiDAR, radar, camera, GPS and weather etc., This approach gives a unified
quantum state representation between heterogeneous sensor modalities. Nav-Q
module processes the fused quantum states through variational quantum circuits
to learn optimal navigation policies under swift dynamic and complex
conditions. Finally, post quantum cryptographic protocols are used to secure
communication channels for both within vehicle communication and V2X (Vehicle

communication from both classical and quantum security threats. Thus, the
proposed framework addresses fundamental challenges in autonomous vehicles
navigation by providing quantum performance and future proof security. Index

Abstract: We introduce RapFlow-TTS, a rapid and high-fidelity TTS acoustic model that
leverages velocity consistency constraints in flow matching (FM) training.
Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves
natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation
steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address
this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along
the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with
fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time
interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of
the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves
high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis
steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.

Result: 清理步骤的时间复杂度降至O(N log N)，空间复杂度为O(N)，码本存储需求极低。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了VSA的可扩展性，实验验证了其高效性。

Abstract: A computational bottleneck in current Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) is
the ``clean-up'' step, which decodes the noisy vectors retrieved from the
architecture. Clean-up typically compares noisy vectors against a ``codebook''
of prototype vectors, incurring computational complexity that is quadratic or
similar. We present a new codebook representation that supports efficient
clean-up, based on Kroneker products of rotation-like matrices. The resulting
clean-up time complexity is linearithmic, i.e. $\mathcal{O}(N\,\text{log}\,N)$,
where $N$ is the vector dimension and also the number of vectors in the
codebook. Clean-up space complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Furthermore, the
codebook is not stored explicitly in computer memory: It can be represented in
$\mathcal{O}(\text{log}\,N)$ space, and individual vectors in the codebook can
be materialized in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. At the same time,
asymptotic memory capacity remains comparable to standard approaches. Computer
experiments confirm these results, demonstrating several orders of magnitude
more scalability than baseline VSA techniques.

Conclusion: 自监督学习特征和量化表示是改善构音障碍语音的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Dysarthria is a neurological disorder that significantly impairs speech
intelligibility, often rendering affected individuals unable to communicate
effectively. This necessitates the development of robust dysarthric-to-regular
speech conversion techniques. In this work, we investigate the utility and
limitations of self-supervised learning (SSL) features and their quantized
representations as an alternative to mel-spectrograms for speech generation.
Additionally, we explore methods to mitigate speaker variability by generating
clean speech in a single-speaker voice using features extracted from WavLM. To
this end, we propose a fully non-autoregressive approach that leverages
Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with Diffusion Transformers to learn a direct
mapping from dysarthric to clean speech. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of discrete acoustic units in improving intelligibility while
achieving faster convergence compared to traditional mel-spectrogram-based
approaches.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized music information retrieval, but
questions remain about their ability to generalize across diverse musical
traditions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art audio foundation models across six musical corpora spanning
Western popular, Greek, Turkish, and Indian classical traditions. We employ
three complementary methodologies to investigate these models' cross-cultural
capabilities: probing to assess inherent representations, targeted supervised
fine-tuning of 1-2 layers, and multi-label few-shot learning for low-resource
scenarios. Our analysis shows varying cross-cultural generalization, with
larger models typically outperforming on non-Western music, though results
decline for culturally distant traditions. Notably, our approaches achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five out of six evaluated datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of foundation models for world music
understanding. We also find that our targeted fine-tuning approach does not
consistently outperform probing across all settings, suggesting foundation
models already encode substantial musical knowledge. Our evaluation framework
and benchmarking results contribute to understanding how far current models are
from achieving universal music representations while establishing metrics for
future progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于无监督深度学习的框架SPArcdl，用于快速预选质子弧治疗中的能量层序列，以优化治疗计划质量和交付效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子弧治疗（PAT）在放疗中具有优势，但能量层序列的优化计算复杂，需要高效方法。

Method: 采用新的数据表示方法（spot-count representation）和UNet架构SPArcdl，优化目标覆盖、减少器官暴露和能量切换时间。

Result: SPArcdl显著提升计划质量和交付效率，减少能量切换时间38.4%，降低脑干平均剂量0.21。

Conclusion: SPArcdl是一种快速有效的工具，可生成高质量PAT计划，同时减少交付时间。

Abstract: Objective. Proton arc therapy (PAT) is an emerging and promising modality in
radiotherapy, offering several advantages over conventional intensitymodulated
proton therapy (IMPT). However, identifying the optimal energy layer (EL)
sequence remains computationally intensive due to the large number of possible
energy layer transitions. This study proposes an unsupervised deep learning
framework for fast and effective EL pre-selection, aiming to minimize energy
layer switch time while preserving high plan quality. Approach. We introduce a
novel data representation method, spot-count representation, which encodes the
number of proton spots intersecting the target and organs at risk (OARs) in a
matrix structured by sorted gantry angles and energy layers. This
representation is the input of a UNet-based architecture, SPArcdl, which is
trained to optimize a tri-objective function: maximizing target coverage,
minimizing OAR exposure, and reducing energy switching time. The model is
evaluated on 54 nasopharyngeal cancer cases, and its performance is benchmarked
against plans generated by SPArcparticle swarm. Main results. SPArcdl produces
EL pre-selection that significantly improves both plan quality and delivery
efficiency. Compared to SPArc particle swarm, it enhances the conformity index
by 0.16 (p < 0.01), reduces the homogeneity index by 0.71 (p < 0.01), shortens
the energy switching time by 38.4% (p < 0.01), and lowers the mean dose to
brainstem by 0.21 (p < 0.01). The results unintentionally reveal employing
unchanged ELS is more time-wise efficient than descended ELS. SPArcdl's
inference time is within 1 second. Significance. SPArcdl is a fast and
effective tool for generating high-quality PAT plans by strategically
pre-selecting energy layers to reduce delivery time while maintaining excellent

### [427] [From Prompts to Constructs: A Dual-Validity Framework for LLM Research in Psychology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16697)
*Zhicheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在心理学研究中应用大型语言模型（LLMs）时可能出现的测量幻象问题，提出了双重效度框架以整合可靠测量和因果推断标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心理学研究中，LLMs被广泛用作工具或模型，但人类测量工具的误用可能导致虚假结果，亟需建立更严格的验证标准。

Method: 提出了一个双重效度框架，根据科学目标的不同调整验证策略，区分了从基本准确性到心理现象模拟的不同证据要求。

Result: 当前实践常将统计模式匹配误认为心理现象证据，未能满足不同研究目标所需的验证标准。

Conclusion: 未来需开发心理构念的计算类比，并建立清晰、可扩展的证据标准，而非盲目应用人类测量工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted across psychology,
serving as research tools, experimental subjects, human simulators, and
computational models of cognition. However, the application of human
measurement tools to these systems can produce contradictory results, raising
concerns that many findings are measurement phantoms--statistical artifacts
rather than genuine psychological phenomena. In this Perspective, we argue that
building a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our
field's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the
standards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to
guide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a
claim scales with its scientific ambition. Using an LLM to classify text may
require only basic accuracy checks, whereas claiming it can simulate anxiety
demands a far more rigorous validation process. Current practice systematically
fails to meet these requirements, often treating statistical pattern matching
as evidence of psychological phenomena. The same model output--endorsing "I am
anxious"--requires different validation strategies depending on whether
researchers claim to measure, characterize, simulate, or model psychological
constructs. Moving forward requires developing computational analogues of
psychological constructs and establishing clear, scalable standards of evidence
rather than the uncritical application of human measurement tools.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）作为心理模拟器，用于角色模拟和认知建模，并讨论了相关方法、验证策略及伦理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏方法指导，本文旨在为心理学和行为学研究提供使用LLMs的框架，以探索其作为模拟器和计算模型的潜力。

Method: 提出了两种主要应用：1）模拟角色和人物以探索多样情境；2）作为计算模型研究认知过程。包括验证方法和用例分析。

Result: 总结了LLMs在心理学研究中的性能（如系统性偏差和文化局限性），并提供了应对挑战的策略。

Conclusion: 强调需透明化模型能力和限制，以帮助研究者克服挑战并利用LLMs的独特能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer emerging opportunities for psychological
and behavioral research, but methodological guidance is lacking. This article
provides a framework for using LLMs as psychological simulators across two
primary applications: simulating roles and personas to explore diverse
contexts, and serving as computational models to investigate cognitive
processes. For simulation, we present methods for developing psychologically
grounded personas that move beyond demographic categories, with strategies for
validation against human data and use cases ranging from studying inaccessible
populations to prototyping research instruments. For cognitive modeling, we
synthesize emerging approaches for probing internal representations,
methodological advances in causal interventions, and strategies for relating
model behavior to human cognition. We address overarching challenges including
prompt sensitivity, temporal limitations from training data cutoffs, and
ethical considerations that extend beyond traditional human subjects review.
Throughout, we emphasize the need for transparency about model capabilities and
constraints. Together, this framework integrates emerging empirical evidence
about LLM performance--including systematic biases, cultural limitations, and
prompt brittleness--to help researchers wrangle these challenges and leverage
the unique capabilities of LLMs in psychological research.

*Chunhou Ji,Qiumeng Li*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: TrajSceneLLM提出了一种多模态框架，结合地图图像和LLM生成的文本描述，增强GPS轨迹的语义理解，显著提升了旅行模式识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以提取GPS轨迹的深层语义表示和结合地图上下文信息，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 框架整合地图图像和LLM生成的文本描述，生成多模态嵌入，并通过MLP分类器进行任务验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在旅行模式识别任务中性能显著提升，减少了对手工特征的依赖。

Conclusion: TrajSceneLLM展示了在空间人工智能中广泛应用的潜力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: GPS trajectory data reveals valuable patterns of human mobility and urban
dynamics, supporting a variety of spatial applications. However, traditional
methods often struggle to extract deep semantic representations and incorporate
contextual map information. We propose TrajSceneLLM, a multimodal perspective
for enhancing semantic understanding of GPS trajectories. The framework
integrates visualized map images (encoding spatial context) and textual
descriptions generated through LLM reasoning (capturing temporal sequences and
movement dynamics). Separate embeddings are generated for each modality and
then concatenated to produce trajectory scene embeddings with rich semantic
content which are further paired with a simple MLP classifier. We validate the
proposed framework on Travel Mode Identification (TMI), a critical task for
analyzing travel choices and understanding mobility behavior. Our experiments
show that these embeddings achieve significant performance improvement,
highlighting the advantage of our LLM-driven method in capturing deep
spatio-temporal dependencies and reducing reliance on handcrafted features.
This semantic enhancement promises significant potential for diverse downstream
applications and future research in geospatial artificial intelligence. The

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于LLM的机器人是否能拓宽在线政治讨论中的观点范围，实验表明该机器人能显著增加讨论的多样性，且AI身份披露不影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线政治讨论常因自我选择和同质化交流导致观点单一，影响民主参与。研究旨在探索技术工具是否能改善这一问题。

Method: 通过两项预注册随机实验，在聊天室中测试LLM机器人监测讨论、补充缺失观点的效果。

Result: 机器人显著扩大了讨论中的观点范围，且AI身份披露未显著影响效果。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的审核工具可积极影响在线政治讨论的多样性。

Abstract: A wide range of participation is essential for democracy, as it helps prevent
the dominance of extreme views, erosion of legitimacy, and political
polarization. However, engagement in online political discussions often
features a limited spectrum of views due to high levels of self-selection and
the tendency of online platforms to facilitate exchanges primarily among
like-minded individuals. This study examines whether an LLM-based bot can widen
the scope of perspectives expressed by participants in online discussions
through two pre-registered randomized experiments conducted in a chatroom. We
evaluate the impact of a bot that actively monitors discussions, identifies
missing arguments, and introduces them into the conversation. The results
indicate that our bot significantly expands the range of arguments, as measured
by both objective and subjective metrics. Furthermore, disclosure of the bot as
AI does not significantly alter these effects. These findings suggest that
LLM-based moderation tools can positively influence online political discourse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统回归树模型在预测准确性上落后于黑盒模型（如随机森林）的问题，同时保持可解释性。

Method: 提出TRUST模型，结合随机森林的准确性和浅层决策树的透明性，并利用大语言模型生成解释。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，TRUST在预测准确性上优于其他可解释模型，且与随机森林相当。

Conclusion: TRUST在准确性和可解释性上均表现出色，优于现有可解释模型。

Abstract: Piecewise-constant regression trees remain popular for their
interpretability, yet often lag behind black-box models like Random Forest in
predictive accuracy. In this work, we introduce TRUST (Transparent, Robust, and
Ultra-Sparse Trees), a novel regression tree model that combines the accuracy
of Random Forests with the interpretability of shallow decision trees and
sparse linear models. TRUST further enhances transparency by leveraging Large
Language Models to generate tailored, user-friendly explanations. Extensive
validation on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrates that
TRUST consistently outperforms other interpretable models -- including CART,
Lasso, and Node Harvest -- in predictive accuracy, while matching the accuracy
of Random Forest and offering substantial gains in both accuracy and
interpretability over M5', a well-established model that is conceptually
related.

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合建模多传感器时间序列数据和多模式失效时间的方法，结合Cox比例风险模型、卷积多输出高斯过程和多项失效模式分布，通过分层贝叶斯框架实现准确预测和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业系统常受多种失效模式影响，现有模型通常独立处理失效模式和剩余使用寿命（RUL）预测，忽略了任务间的内在联系，且缺乏统计严谨性。

Method: 采用分层贝叶斯框架，整合Cox比例风险模型、卷积多输出高斯过程和多项失效模式分布，通过变分贝叶斯和蒙特卡洛采样实现后验分布和预测。

Result: 模型在喷气发动机数据集上通过数值和案例研究验证了其优势，实现了准确预测和鲁棒的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法有效联合建模多传感器数据和失效时间，为工业系统的RUL预测提供了统计严谨且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern industrial systems are often subject to multiple failure modes, and
their conditions are monitored by multiple sensors, generating multiple
time-series signals. Additionally, time-to-failure data are commonly available.
Accurately predicting a system's remaining useful life (RUL) requires
effectively leveraging multi-sensor time-series data alongside multi-mode
failure event data. In most existing models, failure modes and RUL prediction
are performed independently, ignoring the inherent relationship between these
two tasks. Some models integrate multiple failure modes and event prediction
using black-box machine learning approaches, which lack statistical rigor and
cannot characterize the inherent uncertainty in the model and data. This paper
introduces a unified approach to jointly model the multi-sensor time-series
data and failure time concerning multiple failure modes. This proposed model
integrate a Cox proportional hazards model, a Convolved Multi-output Gaussian
Process, and multinomial failure mode distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian
framework with corresponding priors, enabling accurate prediction with robust
uncertainty quantification. Posterior distributions are effectively obtained by
Variational Bayes, and prediction is performed with Monte Carlo sampling. The
advantages of the proposed model is validated through extensive numerical and
case studies with jet-engine dataset.

*João G. Ribeiro,Yaniv Oren,Alberto Sardinha,Matthijs Spaan,Francisco S. Melo*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RecBayes是一种在部分可观测环境下进行临时团队协作的新方法，无需环境状态或队友动作信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要完全可观测状态或队友动作的问题，适用于大规模环境。

Method: 使用基于过去经验的循环贝叶斯分类器，仅通过观测识别团队和任务。

Result: 在扩展到1M状态和2^125观测的基准测试中，RecBayes有效识别团队和任务并协助完成任务。

Conclusion: RecBayes在不依赖环境状态或队友动作的情况下，适用于大规模部分可观测环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes RecBayes, a novel approach for ad hoc teamwork under
partial observability, a setting where agents are deployed on-the-fly to
environments where pre-existing teams operate, that never requires, at any
stage, access to the states of the environment or the actions of its teammates.
We show that by relying on a recurrent Bayesian classifier trained using past
experiences, an ad hoc agent is effectively able to identify known teams and
tasks being performed from observations alone. Unlike recent approaches such as
PO-GPL (Gu et al., 2021) and FEAT (Rahman et al., 2023), that require at some
stage fully observable states of the environment, actions of teammates, or
both, or approaches such as ATPO (Ribeiro et al., 2023) that require the
environments to be small enough to be tabularly modelled (Ribeiro et al.,
2023), in their work up to 4.8K states and 1.7K observations, we show RecBayes
is both able to handle arbitrarily large spaces while never relying on either
states and teammates' actions. Our results in benchmark domains from the
multi-agent systems literature, adapted for partial observability and scaled up
to 1M states and 2^125 observations, show that RecBayes is effective at
identifying known teams and tasks being performed from partial observations
alone, and as a result, is able to assist the teams in solving the tasks
effectively.

Motivation: 解决单一智能体在新多智能体系统中的适应问题，尤其是在任务、环境和未知队友/对手交互中的挑战。

Method: 提出MRDG方法，通过行为轨迹建模队友和对手，结合位置编码、超网络模块和视角对齐模块。

Result: 在SMAC、Overcooked-AI和Melting Pot等基准测试中，MRDG显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ACCA和MRDG为多智能体系统中的适应问题提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Adapting a single agent to a new multi-agent system brings challenges,
necessitating adjustments across various tasks, environments, and interactions
with unknown teammates and opponents. Addressing this challenge is highly
complex, and researchers have proposed two simplified scenarios, Multi-agent
reinforcement learning for zero-shot learning and Ad-Hoc Teamwork. Building on
these foundations, we propose a more comprehensive setting, Agent
Collaborative-Competitive Adaptation (ACCA), which evaluates an agent to
generalize across diverse scenarios, tasks, and interactions with both
unfamiliar opponents and teammates. In ACCA, agents adjust to task and
environmental changes, collaborate with unseen teammates, and compete against
unknown opponents. We introduce a new modeling approach, Multi-Retrieval and
Dynamic Generation (MRDG), that effectively models both teammates and opponents
using their behavioral trajectories. This method incorporates a positional
encoder for varying team sizes and a hypernetwork module to boost agents'
learning and adaptive capabilities. Additionally, a viewpoint alignment module
harmonizes the observational perspectives of retrieved teammates and opponents
with the learning agent. Extensive tests in benchmark scenarios like SMAC,
Overcooked-AI, and Melting Pot show that MRDG significantly improves robust
collaboration and competition with unseen teammates and opponents, surpassing
established baselines. Our code is available at:

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出一种结合几何信息（如姿态）的共形预测方法，以应对几何数据变换（如旋转、翻转）带来的分布偏移问题，恢复其不确定性量化和覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测在几何数据变换下实用性受限，因分布偏移会降低模型性能。

Method: 将几何信息（如姿态）整合到共形预测过程中，利用姿态规范化技术提取信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在离散和连续变换下均优于等变和基于增强的基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合几何信息的共形预测为几何变换提供了一种原则性解决方案，同时适用于黑盒预测器。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction (CP) under geometric data
shifts, where data samples are susceptible to transformations such as rotations
or flips. While CP endows prediction models with post-hoc uncertainty
quantification and formal coverage guarantees, their practicality breaks under
distribution shifts that deteriorate model performance. To address this issue,
we propose integrating geometric information--such as geometric pose--into the
conformal procedure to reinstate its guarantees and ensure robustness under
geometric shifts. In particular, we explore recent advancements on pose
canonicalization as a suitable information extractor for this purpose.
Evaluating the combined approach across discrete and continuous shifts and
against equivariant and augmentation-based baselines, we find that integrating
geometric information with CP yields a principled way to address geometric
shifts while maintaining broad applicability to black-box predictors.

Main category: stat.ML

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型（如Normalizing Flows）在高维数据中收敛速度慢，且难以平衡隐私与效用。本文旨在提出一种更高效且隐私保护的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 通过Latent Noise Injection方法，在潜在空间扰动数据点并映射回数据域，保持观测数据与合成数据的一一对应关系，同时满足局部差分隐私。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高维数据中能更准确地反映真实分布，且通过元分析框架恢复经典效率。扰动参数校准后，能抵御成员推理攻击。

Conclusion: Latent Noise Injection是一种高效且隐私保护的合成数据生成方法，适用于去中心化和隐私敏感领域。

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation has become essential for scalable,
privacy-preserving statistical analysis. While standard approaches based on
generative models, such as Normalizing Flows, have been widely used, they often
suffer from slow convergence in high-dimensional settings, frequently
converging more slowly than the canonical $1/\sqrt{n}$ rate when approximating
the true data distribution.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a Latent Noise Injection method
using Masked Autoregressive Flows (MAF). Instead of directly sampling from the
trained model, our method perturbs each data point in the latent space and maps
it back to the data domain. This construction preserves a one to one
correspondence between observed and synthetic data, enabling synthetic outputs
that closely reflect the underlying distribution, particularly in challenging
high-dimensional regimes where traditional sampling struggles.
  Our procedure satisfies local $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and
introduces a single perturbation parameter to control the privacy-utility
trade-off. Although estimators based on individual synthetic datasets may
converge slowly, we show both theoretically and empirically that aggregating
across $K$ studies in a meta analysis framework restores classical efficiency
and yields consistent, reliable inference. We demonstrate that with a
well-calibrated perturbation parameter, Latent Noise Injection achieves strong
statistical alignment with the original data and robustness against membership
inference attacks. These results position our method as a compelling
alternative to conventional flow-based sampling for synthetic data sharing in
decentralized and privacy-sensitive domains, such as biomedical research.

Conclusion: 该方法在可扩展性和准确性之间取得了平衡，为复杂物理系统中的不确定性建模提供了基础。

Abstract: Operator learning offers a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial
differential equations (PDEs), but scaling probabilistic neural operators such
as the recently proposed Gaussian Processes Operators (GPOs) to
high-dimensional, data-intensive regimes remains a significant challenge. In
this work, we introduce a novel, scalable GPO, which capitalizes on sparsity,
locality, and structural information through judicious kernel design.
Addressing the fundamental limitation of cubic computational complexity, our
method leverages nearest-neighbor-based local kernel approximations in the
spatial domain, sparse kernel approximation in the parameter space, and
structured Kronecker factorizations to enable tractable inference on
large-scale datasets and high-dimensional input. While local approximations
often introduce accuracy trade-offs due to limited kernel interactions, we
overcome this by embedding operator-aware kernel structures and employing
expressive, task-informed mean functions derived from neural operator
architectures. Through extensive evaluations on a broad class of nonlinear PDEs
- including Navier-Stokes, wave advection, Darcy flow, and Burgers' equations -
we demonstrate that our framework consistently achieves high accuracy across
varying discretization scales. These results underscore the potential of our
approach to bridge the gap between scalability and fidelity in GPO, offering a
compelling foundation for uncertainty-aware modeling in complex physical
systems.

Abstract: Score-based methods have recently seen increasing popularity in modeling and
generation. Methods have been constructed to perform hypothesis testing and
change-point detection with score functions, but these methods are in general
not as powerful as their likelihood-based peers. Recent works consider
generalizing the score-based Fisher divergence into a diffusion-divergence by
transforming score functions via multiplication with a matrix-valued function
or a weight matrix. In this paper, we extend the score-based hypothesis test
and change-point detection stopping rule into their diffusion-based analogs.
Additionally, we theoretically quantify the performance of these
diffusion-based algorithms and study scenarios where optimal performance is
achievable. We propose a method of numerically optimizing the weight matrix and
present numerical simulations to illustrate the advantages of diffusion-based
algorithms.

Abstract: Random feature approximation is arguably one of the most widely used
techniques for kernel methods in large-scale learning algorithms. In this work,
we analyze the generalization properties of random feature methods, extending
previous results for Tikhonov regularization to a broad class of spectral
regularization techniques. This includes not only explicit methods but also
implicit schemes such as gradient descent and accelerated algorithms like the
Heavy-Ball and Nesterov method. Through this framework, we enable a theoretical
analysis of neural networks and neural operators through the lens of the Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) approach trained via gradient descent. For our estimators
we obtain optimal learning rates over regularity classes (even for classes that
are not included in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space), which are defined
through appropriate source conditions. This improves or completes previous
results obtained in related settings for specific kernel algorithms.

Conclusion: 条件数可作为信息编码效率的指标，选择性微调为灾难性遗忘提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between the condition number of a neural
network's weight tensor and the extent of information encoded by the associated
processing unit, viewed through the lens of information theory. We argue that a
high condition number, though not sufficient for effective knowledge encoding,
may indicate that the unit has learned to selectively amplify and compress
information. We formalize this intuition, particularly for linear units with
Gaussian inputs, linking the condition number and the transformation's
log-volume scaling factor to the characteristics of the output entropy and the
geometric properties of the learned transformation. Our analysis demonstrates
that for a fixed weight norm, a concentrated distribution of singular values
(high condition number) corresponds to reduced overall information transfer,
indicating a specialized and efficient encoding strategy. Furthermore, we
present a practical case study where these principles are applied to guide
selective fine-tuning of a multimodal Large Language Model, aiming to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting during cross-modal adaptation. Unlike many existing
catastrophic forgetting mitigation methods that rely on access to pre-training
statistics, which are often unavailable, our selective fine-tuning approach
offers a way to bypass this common requirement.

Motivation: 在分布式M估计中，如何以最小的数据传输量识别异质性参数分量是一个重要问题。

Method: 提出了两种方法：基于重归一化Wald测试的方法和极端对比测试（ECT），后者通过样本分割避免偏差积累。

Result: Wald测试在异质性密集时一致，ECT在异质性稀疏时一致且通信高效。结合两种测试可提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在数值实验和案例研究中表现出色，适用于不同异质性水平的场景。

Abstract: We study methods for identifying heterogeneous parameter components in
distributed M-estimation with minimal data transmission. One is based on a
re-normalized Wald test, which is shown to be consistent as long as the number
of distributed data blocks $K$ is of a smaller order of the minimum block
sample size {and the level of heterogeneity is dense}. The second one is an
extreme contrast test (ECT) based on the difference between the largest and
smallest component-wise estimated parameters among data blocks. By introducing
a sample splitting procedure, the ECT can avoid the bias accumulation arising
from the M-estimation procedures, and exhibits consistency for $K$ being much
larger than the sample size while the heterogeneity is sparse. The ECT
procedure is easy to operate and communication-efficient. A combination of the
Wald and the extreme contrast tests is formulated to attain more robust power
under varying levels of sparsity of the heterogeneity. We also conduct
intensive numerical experiments to compare the family-wise error rate (FWER)
and the power of the proposed methods. Additionally, we conduct a case study to
present the implementation and validity of the proposed methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时监控机器学习系统风险违规的通用框架，通过顺序假设检验检测风险违规，适用于动态分布偏移场景。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的机器学习系统面临动态且不可预测的分布偏移，传统风险控制框架缺乏持续监控机制。

Method: 利用'测试下注'范式，设计顺序假设检验方法，检测模型决策机制的风险违规，同时控制误报率。

Result: 方法在异常检测和集合预测等多种偏移场景下有效监控风险。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小假设下广泛适用，为动态环境中的风险监控提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in the real world must operate under
dynamic and often unpredictable distribution shifts. This challenges the
validity of statistical safety assurances on the system's risk established
beforehand. Common risk control frameworks rely on fixed assumptions and lack
mechanisms to continuously monitor deployment reliability. In this work, we
propose a general framework for the real-time monitoring of risk violations in
evolving data streams. Leveraging the 'testing by betting' paradigm, we propose
a sequential hypothesis testing procedure to detect violations of bounded risks
associated with the model's decision-making mechanism, while ensuring control
on the false alarm rate. Our method operates under minimal assumptions on the
nature of encountered shifts, rendering it broadly applicable. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our approach by monitoring risks in outlier detection and
set prediction under a variety of shifts.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于流的生成模型方法，扩展了Schrödinger Bridge（SB）问题到树结构的多边际最优传输（OT）场景，并改进了传统方法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统的最优传输方法（如IPF）在树结构的多边际场景中效率较低，而基于流的IMF方法具有更好的性能，因此需要将其扩展到树结构SB问题。

Method: 通过扩展IMF方法，解决了树结构的SB问题，特别是在Wasserstein重心计算中，结合了流式熵OT求解器。

Conclusion: 该方法为树结构多边际OT问题提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，扩展了流式生成模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable
methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a
dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic
cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB
problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and
practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional
Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting,
optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the
objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of
particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which
Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we
extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our
resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in
the tree-based setting. In the specific case of Wasserstein barycentres, our
approach can be viewed as extending fixed-point approaches for barycentre
computation to the case of flow-based entropic OT solvers.

Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements
of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities
toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.
Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account
for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to
reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use
neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are
computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency
and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an
alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir
computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and
maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly
parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in
neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,
adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our
reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination
fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error
reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,
respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit
dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model
requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for
five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance
qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum
processors.

Conclusion: 该研究为具有实时处理能力的量子储备计算提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process
temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the
restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the
quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time
processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have
introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include
online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable
real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the
feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information
with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the
theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain
underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the
approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by
presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class
of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.
We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural
networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our
analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making
it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for
practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time
processing capabilities.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine
learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models,
potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical
neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum
neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its
mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with
quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across
classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this
architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits
fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal
approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity
check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification
using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical
neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful
learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we
analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two
dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for
enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that
our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity,
suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT devices presents critical challenges in
bandwidth-constrained wireless networks, particularly regarding efficient data
transmission and privacy preservation. This paper presents a novel federated
semantic communication (SC) framework that enables collaborative training of
bandwidth-efficient models for image reconstruction across heterogeneous IoT
devices. By leveraging SC principles to transmit only semantic features, our
approach dramatically reduces communication overhead while preserving
reconstruction quality. We address the fundamental challenge of client
selection in federated learning environments where devices exhibit significant
disparities in dataset sizes and data distributions. Our framework implements
three distinct client selection strategies that explore different trade-offs
between system performance and fairness in resource allocation. The system
employs an end-to-end SC architecture with semantic bottlenecks, coupled with a
loss-based aggregation mechanism that naturally adapts to client heterogeneity.
Experimental evaluation on image data demonstrates that while Utilitarian
selection achieves the highest reconstruction quality, Proportional Fairness
maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing participation
inequality and improving computational efficiency. These results establish that
federated SC can successfully balance reconstruction quality, resource
efficiency, and fairness in heterogeneous IoT deployments, paving the way for
sustainable and privacy-preserving edge intelligence applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为大型模型的通用特征编码提供了有效解决方案，未来将开源代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential
for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing
transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted
task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature
coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large
models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally
incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example,
features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while
those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This
distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned
peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed
feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation
is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of
heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this
alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can
effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate
our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and
SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and
cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will
be released for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的多臂老虎机（MAB）框架，利用预训练的机器学习模型将辅助数据转化为替代奖励，并设计了MLA-UCB算法以解决替代奖励可能存在的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统老虎机算法仅依赖在线数据，数据稀缺且收集成本高。实际应用中，丰富的辅助数据（如历史用户特征）可在部署前获取，但缺乏真实奖励数据导致替代奖励存在偏差。

Method: 提出MLA-UCB算法，适用于任何奖励预测模型和辅助数据形式，无需预知真实与替代奖励的协方差矩阵。

Result: 在预测与真实奖励联合高斯分布且相关性非零时，MLA-UCB可显著提升累积遗憾性能，即使替代奖励均值与真实均值完全不一致。数值实验显示其效率优于标准UCB。

Conclusion: MLA-UCB通过有效利用离线辅助数据，显著提升了老虎机算法的性能，尤其在数据量和相关性适中时表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely adopted framework for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on
online data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online
phase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings,
rich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to
deploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained
machine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and
historical data into \emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this
setting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true
reward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML
predictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose
the Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which
can be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.
When the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves
the cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in
cases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean
rewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance
matrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard
UCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even
when the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and
true rewards are moderate.

Conclusion: 混合和进化方法显著提升了训练效率和准确性，支持了Building Block Hypothesis的有效性。

Abstract: Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) frequently encounters difficulties, including substantial computing
expense and the risk of converging to local optima, attributable to its
dependence on partial weight gradients. Therefore, this work investigates
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) - two
population-based Metaheuristic Optimizers (MHOs) - as alternatives to SGD to
mitigate these constraints. A hybrid PSO-SGD strategy is developed to improve
local search efficiency. The findings indicate that the hybrid PSO-SGD
technique decreases the median training MSE by 90 to 95 percent relative to
conventional GA and PSO across various network sizes (e.g., from around 0.02 to
approximately 0.001 in the Sphere function). RMHC attains substantial
enhancements, reducing MSE by roughly 85 to 90 percent compared to GA.
Simultaneously, RS consistently exhibits errors exceeding 0.3, signifying
subpar performance. These findings underscore that hybrid and evolutionary
procedures significantly improve training efficiency and accuracy compared to
conventional optimization methods and imply that the Building Block Hypothesis
(BBH) may still be valid, indicating that advantageous weight structures are
retained during evolutionary search.

Result: 在多个实例上的实验表明，ACERL优于现有算法，能完全满足约束条件，并在噪声实例中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ACERL通过协调多样化探索和自适应训练，有效解决了DMH问题，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Dynamic material handling (DMH) involves the assignment of dynamically
arriving material transporting tasks to suitable vehicles in real time for
minimising makespan and tardiness. In real-world scenarios, historical task
records are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy
on multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement
learning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events
such as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging
since constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is
received only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,
making the best use of limited computational resources and historical records
for training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different
problem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those
challenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary
reinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors
for diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards
and constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,
ACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving
the policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test
instances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with
several state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the
vehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40
unseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation
further presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous
ablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of
ACERL.

Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena
occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the
impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling
strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$
approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response
in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive
due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to
the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization
frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural
operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that
combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for
physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and
spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics
problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is
represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive
relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and
the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles.
The results for homogenized stresses ($<6\%$ error) show that the approach is
computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).

Abstract: Unoriented surface reconstruction is an important task in computer graphics
and has extensive applications. Based on the compact support of wavelet and
orthogonality properties, classic wavelet surface reconstruction achieves good
and fast reconstruction. However, this method can only handle oriented points.
Despite some improved attempts for unoriented points, such as iWSR, these
methods perform poorly on sparse point clouds. To address these shortcomings,
we propose a wavelet-based method to represent the mollified indicator function
and complete both the orientation and surface reconstruction tasks. We use the
modifying kernel function to smoothen out discontinuities on the surface,
aligning with the continuity of the wavelet basis function. During the
calculation of coefficient, we fully utilize the properties of the
convolutional kernel function to shift the modifying computation onto wavelet
basis to accelerate. In addition, we propose a novel method for constructing
the divergence-free function field and using them to construct the additional
homogeneous constraints to improve the effectiveness and stability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in both orientation and reconstruction for sparse models. We align the matrix
construction with the compact support property of wavelet basis functions to
further accelerate our method, resulting in efficient performance on CPU. Our
source codes will be released on GitHub.

### [458] [Contactless Precision Steering of Particles in a Fluid inside a Cube with Rotating Walls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15958)
*Lucas Amoudruz,Petr Karnakov,Petros Koumoutsakos*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型控制算法，用于在流体中精确操纵多个粒子，通过旋转圆盘生成流场，并结合反馈控制策略实现目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无接触操纵微小物体在生物医学和化学应用中至关重要，但现有方法难以同时捕获多个粒子。

Method: 利用旋转圆盘生成流场，基于ODIL框架的反馈控制策略结合流体动力学方程和路径目标。

Result: 实验证明该方法能同时将两个珠子运输到预定位置。

Conclusion: 该方法为生物医学应用提供了更稳健的无接触粒子操纵技术。

Abstract: Contactless manipulation of small objects is essential for biomedical and
chemical applications, such as cell analysis, assisted fertilisation, and
precision chemistry. Established methods, including optical, acoustic, and
magnetic tweezers, are now complemented by flow control techniques that use
flow-induced motion to enable precise and versatile manipulation. However,
trapping multiple particles in fluid remains a challenge. This study introduces
a novel control algorithm capable of steering multiple particles in flow. The
system uses rotating disks to generate flow fields that transport particles to
precise locations. Disk rotations are governed by a feedback control policy
based on the Optimising a Discrete Loss (ODIL) framework, which combines fluid
dynamics equations with path objectives into a single loss function. Our
experiments, conducted in both simulations and with the physical device,
demonstrate the capability of the approach to transport two beads
simultaneously to predefined locations, advancing robust contactless particle
manipulation for biomedical applications.

*Peizhi Wu,Rong Kang,Tieying Zhang,Jianjun Chen,Ryan Marcus,Zachary G. Ives*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GRASP是一种无需数据访问的基数估计系统，能够在现实世界的不完整和不平衡查询工作负载下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基数估计方法依赖数据访问，而现实中的组织政策可能限制全局数据访问，且现有查询驱动模型假设理想化的工作负载条件。

Method: GRASP采用组合设计，包括处理范围谓词的表级基数估计模型和捕获基关系间连接相关性的新型计数草图模型。

Result: GRASP在三个数据库实例中表现优于现有查询驱动模型，甚至在CEB-IMDb-full基准测试中接近或超越传统方法。

Conclusion: GRASP在无需数据访问和仅使用少量连接模板的情况下，实现了高精度和低延迟的基数估计。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation (CardEst) is a critical aspect of query optimization.
Traditionally, it leverages statistics built directly over the data. However,
organizational policies (e.g., regulatory compliance) may restrict global data
access. Fortunately, query-driven cardinality estimation can learn CardEst
models using query workloads. However, existing query-driven models often
require access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume
perfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join
graphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join
templates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic
cardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world
constraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates
and is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new per-table
CardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and
a novel learned count sketch model that captures join correlations across base
relations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP
consistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads,
both in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP
achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches
built over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark --
despite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible
join templates.

*Yilin Zhang,Xinran Zhao,Zora Zhiruo Wang,Chenyang Yang,Jiayi Wei,Tongshuang Wu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于抽象语法树（AST）的代码分块方法（\ourwork），以解决现有行分块方法在语义结构上的不足，显著提升了代码生成任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于行的代码分块方法常破坏语义结构，影响生成质量，因此需要一种结构感知的分块方法。

Method: 通过递归分解大型AST节点并合并兄弟节点，生成语义连贯的分块，同时满足大小限制。

Result: 在RepoEval检索任务中Recall@5提升4.3点，SWE-bench生成任务中Pass@1提升2.67点。

Conclusion: 结构感知的分块方法对提升检索增强的代码生成任务至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale
code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve
actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is
chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing
line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting
functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We
propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method
that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling
nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained,
semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving
performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3
points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation.
Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling
retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SWE-Bench提交过程缺乏详细文档，许多解决方案的设计和来源不明确，因此需要系统研究这些提交以了解当前APR领域的进展。

Method: 研究分析了SWE-Bench Lite（68项）和Verified（79项）排行榜的所有提交，从提交者类型、产品可用性、LLM使用和系统架构等维度进行考察。

Result: 研究发现专有LLM（如Claude 3.5/3.7）占主导地位，代理与非代理设计并存，贡献者包括个人开发者到大型科技公司。

Conclusion: 研究为APR领域提供了全面的现状分析，揭示了技术趋势和贡献者生态。

Abstract: The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been driven by
advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based
systems. SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair
systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source
Python repositories. Its public leaderboards, SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified, have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing
solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed
documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain
unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all
submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (68 entries) and Verified (79 entries)
leaderboards, analyzing 67 unique approaches across dimensions such as
submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our
findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5/3.7),
the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base
spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究探讨了将AI工具集成到现代分布式软件质量保证（QA）流程中的潜力与挑战，通过实验验证了其可行性，但也指出了语义覆盖、黑盒性和可解释性等关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QA方法难以应对现代软件系统的复杂性、规模和快速迭代，资源有限导致质量成本高昂，因此探索AI工具的集成成为研究动机。

Method: 研究分析了AI工具在验证和验证过程中的应用，包括测试分析、测试用例生成、回归测试等，并通过企业级应用的端到端回归测试验证了AI代理的实用性。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的测试用例仅有8.3%的不稳定执行率，表明AI工具有显著潜力，但也暴露了语义覆盖、黑盒性和可解释性等挑战。

Conclusion: AI在QA中具有变革潜力，但需战略性地实施，并开发适当的验证方法以应对现有局限性。

Abstract: Traditional quality assurance (QA) methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexity, scale, and rapid iteration cycles of modern software
systems and are strained by limited resources available, leading to substantial
costs associated with poor quality. The object of this research is the Quality
Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject
of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of
integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We
performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and
validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence
partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding
inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case
generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to
end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application
utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of
concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3%
flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for
the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial
challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically
identical coverage, "black box" nature and lack of explainability from
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated
test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough
verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The
research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the
importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies,
considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate
verification methodologies.

TL;DR: 论文提出SemAgent，一种基于工作流的方法，通过结合问题、代码和执行语义生成更完整的补丁，显著提升自动程序修复（APR）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR系统在修复问题时过于局部化，缺乏对问题、代码和执行语义的深入理解，导致生成的补丁过拟合。

Method: SemAgent采用四步流程：利用执行语义获取上下文，通过抽象理解问题语义，在抽象上下文中隔离代码语义，并通过两阶段架构（修复和审查）生成补丁。

Result: 在SWEBench-Lite基准测试中，SemAgent的解决率为44.66%，优于其他工作流方法，并在多行推理和边缘案例处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: 结合问题、代码和执行的语义理解可以生成更鲁棒和语义一致的修复补丁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream
software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In
particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level
issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been
significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving
such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately
suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper
understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics.
Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user
issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation,
we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue,
code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete -
identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through
a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant
context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c)
isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d)
leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that
proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant
fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our
methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark
beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of
7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding.
We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring
multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that
incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust
and semantically consistent repairs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型编码工具的隐私和安全风险，提出了应对措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型编码工具的普及，隐私泄露、安全漏洞和模型“迎合”错误等问题日益突出，需采取措施保障安全性和准确性。

Method: 建议企业对AI生成的代码进行标记和审查，将提示和输出限制在私有或本地部署中，遵守安全法规，并增加测试以检测“迎合”行为。

Result: 研究发现10%的提示泄露隐私，42%的生成代码存在安全漏洞，模型可能“迎合”错误观点。

Conclusion: 企业需平衡开发速度与安全，通过审查、私有部署和测试来降低风险。

Abstract: Large-language-model coding tools are now mainstream in software engineering.
But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they
present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated
snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong
ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every
AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or
on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that
catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决天文观测中因标记数据有限导致机器学习模型泛化能力不足的问题，尤其是对稀有但科学价值高的天体。

Method: 利用Galaxy Zoo 2数据集，开发条件扩散模型生成符合形态特征的星系图像，并用于数据增强。

Result: 在标准形态分类中性能提升30%，稀有天体检测数量从352增加到872。

Conclusion: 生成模型能有效填补标记数据不足的空白，为未来天体物理基础模型开发提供启示。

Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect
critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical
foundation model developments. Our project homepage is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于重复委托-代理博弈的框架，通过自适应合同实现多智能体系统中的公平性，同时保持效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统中隐藏的异质性导致财富分配不均，即使规则相同。现实中的例子激发了研究公平性的需求。

Method: 采用重复委托-代理博弈框架，委托人通过学习提供自适应合同，利用简单的线性合同结构。

Result: 公平性委托人能学习到同质线性合同，在序列社会困境中均衡结果，且不牺牲效率。

Conclusion: 该框架能促进系统公平与稳定，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Fairness is desirable yet challenging to achieve within multi-agent systems,
especially when agents differ in latent traits that affect their abilities.
This hidden heterogeneity often leads to unequal distributions of wealth, even
when agents operate under the same rules. Motivated by real-world examples, we
propose a framework based on repeated principal-agent games, where a principal,
who also can be seen as a player of the game, learns to offer adaptive
contracts to agents. By leveraging a simple yet powerful contract structure, we
show that a fairness-aware principal can learn homogeneous linear contracts
that equalize outcomes across agents in a sequential social dilemma.
Importantly, this fairness does not come at the cost of efficiency: our results
demonstrate that it is possible to promote equity and stability in the system
while preserving overall performance.

Motivation: 凸马尔可夫博弈扩展了马尔可夫决策过程到多智能体场景，但面临非凸性、缺乏贝尔曼一致性等挑战。论文旨在解决这些挑战并提供收敛保证。

Result: 证明了独立策略梯度方法在凸马尔可夫博弈中能全局收敛到纳什均衡，并首次提供了随机嵌套和交替梯度方法的全局收敛保证。

Conclusion: 论文为凸马尔可夫博弈中的策略梯度方法提供了理论支持，扩展了多智能体强化学习的收敛性分析框架。

Abstract: We contribute the first provable guarantees of global convergence to Nash
equilibria (NE) in two-player zero-sum convex Markov games (cMGs) by using
independent policy gradient methods. Convex Markov games, recently defined by
Gemp et al. (2024), extend Markov decision processes to multi-agent settings
with preferences that are convex over occupancy measures, offering a broad
framework for modeling generic strategic interactions. However, even the
fundamental min-max case of cMGs presents significant challenges, including
inherent nonconvexity, the absence of Bellman consistency, and the complexity
of the infinite horizon.
  We follow a two-step approach. First, leveraging properties of
hidden-convex--hidden-concave functions, we show that a simple nonconvex
regularization transforms the min-max optimization problem into a
nonconvex-proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (NC-pPL) objective. Crucially, this
regularization can stabilize the iterates of independent policy gradient
methods and ultimately lead them to converge to equilibria. Second, building on
this reduction, we address the general constrained min-max problems under
NC-pPL and two-sided pPL conditions, providing the first global convergence
guarantees for stochastic nested and alternating gradient descent-ascent
methods, which we believe may be of independent interest.

Motivation: 了解学生和教师对GAI在教育中的看法，揭示创新与监管之间的张力。

Method: 使用情感分析、主题建模和作者分类，提出并验证基于GPT-4o的模块化框架。

Result: GPT-4o在情感分析中准确率达90.6%，提取出12个潜在主题。学生和教师对GAI的态度存在差异。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的制度政策、透明的GAI整合实践和支持机制，LLM框架在在线社区分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) technologies are quickly reshaping the educational
landscape. As adoption accelerates, understanding how students and educators
perceive these tools is essential. This study presents one of the most
comprehensive analyses to date of stakeholder discourse dynamics on GAI in
education using social media data. Our dataset includes 1,199 Reddit posts and
13,959 corresponding top-level comments. We apply sentiment analysis, topic
modeling, and author classification. To support this, we propose and validate a
modular framework that leverages prompt-based large language models (LLMs) for
analysis of online social discourse, and we evaluate this framework against
classical natural language processing (NLP) models. Our GPT-4o pipeline
consistently outperforms prior approaches across all tasks. For example, it
achieved 90.6% accuracy in sentiment analysis against gold-standard human
annotations. Topic extraction uncovered 12 latent topics in the public
discourse with varying sentiment and author distributions. Teachers and
students convey optimism about GAI's potential for personalized learning and
productivity in higher education. However, key differences emerged: students
often voice distress over false accusations of cheating by AI detectors, while
teachers generally express concern about job security, academic integrity, and
institutional pressures to adopt GAI tools. These contrasting perspectives
highlight the tension between innovation and oversight in GAI-enabled learning
environments. Our findings suggest a need for clearer institutional policies,
more transparent GAI integration practices, and support mechanisms for both
educators and students. More broadly, this study demonstrates the potential of
LLM-based frameworks for modeling stakeholder discourse within online
communities.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在EDA中的生成任务，而嵌入任务（如代码搜索、功能等价性检查等）被忽视，但这些任务对硬件设计至关重要。

Method: 提出DeepRTL2模型，同时处理生成和嵌入任务，覆盖EDA中的多样化需求。

Result: 实验表明，DeepRTL2在所有评估任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DeepRTL2为EDA领域提供了首个全面解决方案，填补了嵌入任务的空白。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into electronic design
automation (EDA) has significantly advanced the field, offering transformative
benefits, particularly in register transfer level (RTL) code generation and
understanding. While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
fine-tuning LLMs for these generation-based tasks, embedding-based tasks, which
are equally critical to EDA workflows, have been largely overlooked. These
tasks, including natural language code search, RTL code functionality
equivalence checking, and performance prediction, are essential for
accelerating and optimizing the hardware design process. To address this gap,
we present DeepRTL2, a family of versatile LLMs that unifies both generation-
and embedding-based tasks related to RTL. By simultaneously tackling a broad
range of tasks, DeepRTL2 represents the first model to provide a comprehensive
solution to the diverse challenges in EDA. Through extensive experiments, we
show that DeepRTL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用深度学习和硬件约束优化Delta-Sigma ADC的设计，特别是在DC转换中实现高性能与硬件效率的平衡。

Method: 使用RNN描述调制器和滤波器，结合高端优化器和自定义损失函数，量化权重、信号饱和等硬件约束。

Result: 在特定硬件映射复杂度下优化SNR（ENOB），成功实现SNR（>13bit）与面积（<14pF）的权衡。

Conclusion: RCNet为Delta-Sigma ADC设计提供了新的自由度，表明高性能不一定依赖高阶调制器。

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep learning model (RCNet) for Delta-Sigma
($\Delta\Sigma$) ADCs. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allow to describe both
modulators and filters. This analogy is applied to Incremental ADCs (IADC).
High-end optimizers combined with full-custom losses are used to define
additional hardware design constraints: quantized weights, signal saturation,
temporal noise injection, devices area. Focusing on DC conversion, our early
results demonstrate that $SNR$ defined as an Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB)
can be optimized under a certain hardware mapping complexity. The proposed
RCNet succeeded to provide design tradeoffs in terms of $SNR$ ($>$13bit) versus
area constraints ($<$14pF total capacitor) at a given $OSR$ (80 samples).
Interestingly, it appears that the best RCNet architectures do not necessarily
rely on high-order modulators, leveraging additional topology exploration
degrees of freedom.

Motivation: 传统系外行星分类方法资源消耗大，需要更高效的机器学习技术来优化分类过程。

Conclusion: 研究展示了ViT模型的潜力，但数据集规模限制仍需解决，未来需优化模型架构。

Abstract: The classification of exoplanets has been a longstanding challenge in
astronomy, requiring significant computational and observational resources.
Traditional methods demand substantial effort, time, and cost, highlighting the
need for advanced machine learning techniques to enhance classification
efficiency. In this study, we propose a methodology that transforms raw light
curve data from NASA's Kepler mission into Gramian Angular Fields (GAFs) and
Recurrence Plots (RPs) using the Gramian Angular Difference Field and
recurrence plot techniques. These transformed images serve as inputs to the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model, leveraging its ability to capture intricate
temporal dependencies. We assess the performance of the model through recall,
precision, and F1 score metrics, using a 5-fold cross-validation approach to
obtain a robust estimate of the model's performance and reduce evaluation bias.
Our comparative analysis reveals that RPs outperform GAFs, with the ViT model
achieving an 89.46$\%$ recall and an 85.09$\%$ precision rate, demonstrating
its significant capability in accurately identifying exoplanetary transits.
Despite using under-sampling techniques to address class imbalance, dataset
size reduction remains a limitation. This study underscores the importance of
further research into optimizing model architectures to enhance automation,
performance, and generalization of the model.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出MoNetV2，通过融合图像与运动信息及多级一致性约束，提升自由手3D超声重建的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的自由手3D超声重建方法在复杂运动轨迹下难以减少累积漂移，需提升重建精度。

Method: 1. 提出传感器辅助的时序多分支结构；2. 设计在线多级一致性约束；3. 蒸馏在线多模态自监督策略。

Result: MoNetV2在三个大数据集上超越现有方法，重建质量和泛化性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MoNetV2通过多模态融合和多级约束，有效解决了复杂运动下的重建问题。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) aims to provide sonographers with the
spatial relationships of anatomical structures, playing a crucial role in
clinical diagnosis. Recently, deep-learning-based freehand 3D US has made
significant advancements. It reconstructs volumes by estimating transformations
between images without external tracking. However, image-only reconstruction
poses difficulties in reducing cumulative drift and further improving
reconstruction accuracy, particularly in scenarios involving complex motion
trajectories. In this context, we propose an enhanced motion network (MoNetV2)
to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of reconstruction under diverse
scanning velocities and tactics. First, we propose a sensor-based temporal and
multi-branch structure that fuses image and motion information from a velocity
perspective to improve image-only reconstruction accuracy. Second, we devise an
online multi-level consistency constraint that exploits the inherent
consistency of scans to handle various scanning velocities and tactics. This
constraint exploits both scan-level velocity consistency, path-level appearance
consistency, and patch-level motion consistency to supervise inter-frame
transformation estimation. Third, we distill an online multi-modal
self-supervised strategy that leverages the correlation between network
estimation and motion information to further reduce cumulative errors.
Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that MoNetV2 surpasses existing
methods in both reconstruction quality and generalizability performance across
three large datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HistoStainAlign是一种深度学习框架，直接从H&E全切片图像预测IHC染色模式，无需注释或组织配准，提高了诊断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHC染色成本高、耗时长且资源密集，限制了其广泛应用。本研究旨在通过计算模型预测IHC染色模式，减少对实际IHC染色的依赖。

Method: 提出HistoStainAlign框架，通过对比训练策略整合H&E和IHC的嵌入特征，学习形态学和分子特征的联合表示。

Result: 在胃肠道和肺组织WSIs上评估，对P53、PD-L1和Ki-67三种IHC染色的加权F1分数分别为0.735、0.830和0.723。

Conclusion: HistoStainAlign展示了作为预筛查工具的潜力，可优化IHC染色的工作流程，提高效率。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological
analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue
architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins
within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment
planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and
resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these
limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning
framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide
images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular
features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a
contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining
modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model
was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used
IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores
of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI:
0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC
stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive
alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a
baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive
learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the
potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping
prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.

### [474] [InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15745)
*Minsoo Kim,Kyuhong Shim,Jungwook Choi,Simyung Chang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: InfiniPot-V是一种无需训练、与查询无关的框架，通过动态压缩KV缓存，解决了MLLMs在长视频流处理中的内存瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理长视频时，KV缓存会线性增长，超出设备内存限制，现有压缩方法无法满足实时性和内存限制需求。

Method: InfiniPot-V通过Temporal-axis Redundancy（TaR）和Value-Norm（VaN）动态压缩缓存，实现硬性内存上限。

Result: 在多个MLLMs和视频基准测试中，InfiniPot-V将GPU峰值内存降低94%，保持实时生成，且准确率不降。

Conclusion: InfiniPot-V无需重训练或查询知识，解决了设备端视频流助手的KV缓存瓶颈。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long
video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly
exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior
compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available
offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream
length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that
enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video
understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set
threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes
temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii)
keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four
open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks,
InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation,
and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By
dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge,
InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过生成反事实图像模拟无疾病状态下的解剖结构，改进医学图像分割，提升临床决策准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病会改变健康组织的表现，导致分割模型在真实数据上表现不佳，可能引发误诊。

Method: 生成反事实图像模拟无疾病状态，不改变底层结构，用于分割感兴趣区域。

Result: 在两个真实临床胸部X光数据集上，反事实图像显著改善了解剖结构分割。

Conclusion: 反事实图像有助于提升分割准确性，支持下游临床决策。

Abstract: Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images plays an important role in
the quantitative assessment of various diseases. However, accurate segmentation
becomes significantly more challenging in the presence of disease. Disease
patterns can alter the appearance of surrounding healthy tissues, introduce
ambiguous boundaries, or even obscure critical anatomical structures. As such,
segmentation models trained on real-world datasets may struggle to provide good
anatomical segmentation, leading to potential misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
generate counterfactual (CF) images to simulate how the same anatomy would
appear in the absence of disease without altering the underlying structure. We
then use these CF images to segment structures of interest, without requiring
any changes to the underlying segmentation model. Our experiments on two
real-world clinical chest X-ray datasets show that the use of counterfactual
images improves anatomical segmentation, thereby aiding downstream clinical
decision-making.

### [476] [Pixel-wise Modulated Dice Loss for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15744)
*Seyed Mohsen Hosseini*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Dice损失函数（PM Dice loss），通过像素级调制项解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡和难度不平衡问题，计算成本低且效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，类别不平衡和难度不平衡导致神经网络训练效果不佳，现有方法计算成本高且效果有限。

Method: 提出PM Dice loss，通过在Dice损失中加入像素级调制项，同时解决类别和难度不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个常用医学分割任务中，PM Dice loss表现优于其他针对难度不平衡的方法。

Conclusion: PM Dice loss是一种简单有效的改进方法，能显著提升医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Class imbalance and the difficulty imbalance are the two types of data
imbalance that affect the performance of neural networks in medical
segmentation tasks. In class imbalance the loss is dominated by the majority
classes and in difficulty imbalance the loss is dominated by easy to classify
pixels. This leads to an ineffective training. Dice loss, which is based on a
geometrical metric, is very effective in addressing the class imbalance
compared to the cross entropy (CE) loss, which is adopted directly from
classification tasks. To address the difficulty imbalance, the common approach
is employing a re-weighted CE loss or a modified Dice loss to focus the
training on difficult to classify areas. The existing modification methods are
computationally costly and with limited success. In this study we propose a
simple modification to the Dice loss with minimal computational cost. With a
pixel level modulating term, we take advantage of the effectiveness of Dice
loss in handling the class imbalance to also handle the difficulty imbalance.
Results on three commonly used medical segmentation tasks show that the
proposed Pixel-wise Modulated Dice loss (PM Dice loss) outperforms other
methods, which are designed to tackle the difficulty imbalance problem.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的反事实增强方法（DCA），用于提升膝关节骨关节炎（KOA）自动分级的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决KOA自动分级中观察者间差异大和深度学习模型在关键决策边界附近鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 使用扩散模型和随机微分方程（SDE）生成目标反事实示例，并结合自校正学习策略优化分类器。

Result: 在OAI和MOST数据集上显著提高了分类准确性，并验证了潜在空间拓扑与KOA临床进展的一致性。

Conclusion: DCA框架将模型不确定性转化为鲁棒训练信号，为开发更准确、可信的自动诊断系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Automated grading of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) from radiographs is challenged
by significant inter-observer variability and the limited robustness of deep
learning models, particularly near critical decision boundaries. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based
Counterfactual Augmentation (DCA), which enhances model robustness and
interpretability by generating targeted counterfactual examples. The method
navigates the latent space of a diffusion model using a Stochastic Differential
Equation (SDE), governed by balancing a classifier-informed boundary drive with
a manifold constraint. The resulting counterfactuals are then used within a
self-corrective learning strategy to improve the classifier by focusing on its
specific areas of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on the public
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)
datasets demonstrate that this approach significantly improves classification
accuracy across multiple model architectures. Furthermore, the method provides
interpretability by visualizing minimal pathological changes and revealing that
the learned latent space topology aligns with clinical knowledge of KOA
progression. The DCA framework effectively converts model uncertainty into a
robust training signal, offering a promising pathway to developing more
accurate and trustworthy automated diagnostic systems. Our code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的算法，显著提升现有图像编解码器的感知质量，并优化解码时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无需训练的感知图像编解码器依赖扩散反演或样本通信，解码时间过长（1分钟至不可行）。

Method: 提出一种理论保证的算法，针对不同解码时间预算（≈0.1s、0.1-10s、≥10s）优化感知质量。

Result: 将解码时间从1分钟缩短至0.1-10s，感知质量相当；适用于非可微分编解码器（如VTM），并提升现有编解码器（如MS-ILLM）。

Conclusion: 该方法在快速解码下显著提升感知质量，优于现有基于条件生成模型的编解码器（如HiFiC和MS-ILLM）。

Abstract: Training-free perceptual image codec adopt pre-trained unconditional
generative model during decoding to avoid training new conditional generative
model. However, they heavily rely on diffusion inversion or sample
communication, which take 1 min to intractable amount of time to decode a
single image. In this paper, we propose a training-free algorithm that improves
the perceptual quality of any existing codec with theoretical guarantee. We
further propose different implementations for optimal perceptual quality when
decoding time budget is $\approx 0.1$s, $0.1-10$s and $\ge 10$s. Our approach:
1). improves the decoding time of training-free codec from 1 min to $0.1-10$s
with comparable perceptual quality. 2). can be applied to non-differentiable
codec such as VTM. 3). can be used to improve previous perceptual codecs, such
as MS-ILLM. 4). can easily achieve perception-distortion trade-off.
Empirically, we show that our approach successfully improves the perceptual
quality of ELIC, VTM and MS-ILLM with fast decoding. Our approach achieves
comparable FID to previous training-free codec with significantly less decoding
time. And our approach still outperforms previous conditional generative model
based codecs such as HiFiC and MS-ILLM in terms of FID. The source code is
provided in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨领域训练的IQA模型，结合皮肤病学和非皮肤病学的IQA数据集，以解决远程皮肤病学中图像质量评估的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程皮肤病学中图像质量差是一个未解决的问题，影响了远程咨询的效果。现有的皮肤病学IQA研究未能充分利用非皮肤病学IQA的最新进展。

Method: 通过创建新的皮肤病学IQA数据库（Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial），并结合跨领域训练方法，利用更大规模的图像数据集和人类观察者的评分。

Result: 跨领域训练在多个领域中表现最优，克服了皮肤病学IQA数据规模小的限制，并提升了图像质量管理的效果。

Conclusion: 跨领域训练方法显著提升了远程皮肤病学中的图像质量管理，为未来的研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Teledermatology has become a widely accepted communication method in daily
clinical practice, enabling remote care while showing strong agreement with
in-person visits. Poor image quality remains an unsolved problem in
teledermatology and is a major concern to practitioners, as bad-quality images
reduce the usefulness of the remote consultation process. However, research on
Image Quality Assessment (IQA) in dermatology is sparse, and does not leverage
the latest advances in non-dermatology IQA, such as using larger image
databases with ratings from large groups of human observers. In this work, we
propose cross-domain training of IQA models, combining dermatology and
non-dermatology IQA datasets. For this purpose, we created a novel dermatology
IQA database, Legit.Health-DIQA-Artificial, using dermatology images from
several sources and having them annotated by a group of human observers. We
demonstrate that cross-domain training yields optimal performance across
domains and overcomes one of the biggest limitations in dermatology IQA, which
is the small scale of data, and leads to models trained on a larger pool of
image distortions, resulting in a better management of image quality in the
teledermatology process.

TL;DR: PR-INR框架通过渐进式隐式神经表示，结合运动校正和结构细化，显著提升了MRI切片到体积重建的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI切片到体积重建在加速采集或患者运动时面临局部细节丢失、全局结构混叠和体积各向异性等挑战。

Method: PR-INR框架包含运动感知扩散模块、隐式细节恢复模块和体素连续感知表示模块，逐步优化重建质量。

Result: 在多种运动条件下，PR-INR在定量重建指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，并展现出跨领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: PR-INR为MRI重建提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: In motion-robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), slice-to-volume
reconstruction is critical for recovering anatomically consistent 3D brain
volumes from 2D slices, especially under accelerated acquisitions or patient
motion. However, this task remains challenging due to hierarchical structural
disruptions. It includes local detail loss from k-space undersampling, global
structural aliasing caused by motion, and volumetric anisotropy. Therefore, we
propose a progressive refinement implicit neural representation (PR-INR)
framework. Our PR-INR unifies motion correction, structural refinement, and
volumetric synthesis within a geometry-aware coordinate space. Specifically, a
motion-aware diffusion module is first employed to generate coarse volumetric
reconstructions that suppress motion artifacts and preserve global anatomical
structures. Then, we introduce an implicit detail restoration module that
performs residual refinement by aligning spatial coordinates with visual
features. It corrects local structures and enhances boundary precision.
Further, a voxel continuous-aware representation module represents the image as
a continuous function over 3D coordinates. It enables accurate inter-slice
completion and high-frequency detail recovery. We evaluate PR-INR on five
public MRI datasets under various motion conditions (3% and 5% displacement),
undersampling rates (4x and 8x) and slice resolutions (scale = 5). Experimental
results demonstrate that PR-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative reconstruction metrics and visual quality. It further shows
generalization and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的自动计算孕龄方法，通过新颖的分割架构和距离图克服数据集限制，性能接近现有最佳模型，适用于资源有限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统孕龄估计方法（如末次月经）在某些情况下难以获取，超声方法虽可靠但依赖人工测量且引入变异性。

Method: 采用可解释的深度学习方法，结合新颖分割架构和距离图，减少复杂性并适应有限标注数据。

Result: 性能接近现有最佳模型，距离图特别适用于估计股骨端点。

Conclusion: 该方法在资源有限环境中表现优异，为孕龄估计提供了高效自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Being born small carries significant health risks, including increased
neonatal mortality and a higher likelihood of future cardiac diseases. Accurate
estimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but
traditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are
in some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer
greater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce
variability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method
for automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation
architecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity
of segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly
suitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.
Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is
particularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VesselSDF利用符号距离场（SDF）改进稀疏CT扫描中血管网络的连续重建，解决了现有深度学习方法在结构连续性和几何保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏CT扫描中血管网络的精确分割面临挑战，尤其是由于血管的薄壁分支特性及扫描平面的稀疏性。现有基于二值体素分类的深度学习方法难以保证结构连续性和几何保真度。

Method: 提出VesselSDF框架，将血管分割问题转化为连续的SDF回归问题，每个体素点由其到最近血管表面的符号距离表示。通过自适应高斯正则化消除SDF常见伪影。

Result: 实验表明，VesselSDF显著优于现有方法，保留了血管几何和连通性，提升了临床血管分析的可靠性。

Conclusion: VesselSDF通过连续SDF表示和自适应正则化，实现了更精确的血管重建，为临床提供了更可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vascular networks from sparse CT scan slices remains
a significant challenge in medical imaging, particularly due to the thin,
branching nature of vessels and the inherent sparsity between imaging planes.
Existing deep learning approaches, based on binary voxel classification, often
struggle with structural continuity and geometric fidelity. To address this
challenge, we present VesselSDF, a novel framework that leverages signed
distance fields (SDFs) for robust vessel reconstruction. Our method
reformulates vessel segmentation as a continuous SDF regression problem, where
each point in the volume is represented by its signed distance to the nearest
vessel surface. This continuous representation inherently captures the smooth,
tubular geometry of blood vessels and their branching patterns. We obtain
accurate vessel reconstructions while eliminating common SDF artifacts such as
floating segments, thanks to our adaptive Gaussian regularizer which ensures
smoothness in regions far from vessel surfaces while producing precise geometry
near the surface boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that
VesselSDF significantly outperforms existing methods and preserves vessel
geometry and connectivity, enabling more reliable vascular analysis in clinical
settings.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DiffO是一种单步扩散模型，用于图像压缩，通过VQ残差训练和速率自适应噪声调制，在极低比特率下实现高质量和快速解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像压缩方法在极低比特率下质量下降严重，扩散模型虽有所改进，但仍存在解码延迟高和感知质量有限的问题。

Method: 结合VQ残差训练（捕捉全局几何和高频细节）和速率自适应噪声调制（动态调整去噪强度）。

Result: DiffO在压缩性能上超越现有方法，解码速度提升约50倍。

Conclusion: DiffO显著提升了生成编解码器的实用性，适用于极低比特率场景。

Abstract: Although image compression is fundamental to visual data processing and has
inspired numerous standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer
severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent
diffusion based models provided enhanced generative performance at low
bitrates, they still yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding
latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the first
single step diffusion model for image compression (DiffO) that delivers high
perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra low bitrates. DiffO achieves
these goals by coupling two key innovations: (i) VQ Residual training, which
factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space,
capturing both global geometry and high frequency details; and (ii) rate
adaptive noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength on the fly to match
the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that DiffO surpasses state of
the art compression performance while improving decoding speed by about 50x
compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly improving the practicality
of generative codecs. The code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法有望辅助放射科医生实现早期和准确的乳腺癌诊断。

Abstract: Breast ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool for early breast cancer
detection, but automated tumor segmentation is challenging due to inherent
noise, variations in scale of lesions, and fuzzy boundaries. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel hybrid attention-based network for lesion
segmentation. Our proposed architecture integrates a pre-trained DenseNet121 in
the encoder part for robust feature extraction with a multi-branch
attention-enhanced decoder tailored for breast ultrasound images. The
bottleneck incorporates Global Spatial Attention (GSA), Position Encoding (PE),
and Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) to learn global context, spatial
relationships, and relative positional features. The Spatial Feature
Enhancement Block (SFEB) is embedded at skip connections to refine and enhance
spatial features, enabling the network to focus more effectively on tumor
regions. A hybrid loss function combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and
Jaccard Index loss optimizes both pixel-level accuracy and region-level overlap
metrics, enhancing robustness to class imbalance and irregular tumor shapes.
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting its potential to assist radiologists in early and
accurate breast cancer diagnosis.

Result: 实验表明，简单且针对组织病理学定制的架构在有限数据集上表现更优，且能减少过拟合。

Conclusion: 组织病理学图像分析需要定制化模型架构，而非直接采用自然图像分析的模型。

Abstract: This study investigates the critical problem of overfitting in deep learning
models applied to histopathology image analysis. We show that simply adopting
and fine-tuning large-scale models designed for natural image analysis often
leads to suboptimal performance and significant overfitting when applied to
histopathology tasks. Through extensive experiments with various model
architectures, including ResNet variants and Vision Transformers (ViT), we show
that increasing model capacity does not necessarily improve performance on
histopathology datasets. Our findings emphasize the need for customized
architectures specifically designed for histopathology image analysis,
particularly when working with limited datasets. Using Oesophageal
Adenocarcinomas public dataset, we demonstrate that simpler, domain-specific
architectures can achieve comparable or better performance while minimizing
overfitting.

18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) is the most commonly used tracer but
shows limited effectiveness for certain tumors. In contrast,
6-18F-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offers higher specificity
for neuroendocrine tumors and neurological disorders. However, its complex
synthesis and limitations in transportation and clinical use hinder widespread
adoption. During PET imaging, the sinogram represents a form of raw data
acquired by the scanner. Therefore, modeling in projection domain enables more
direct utilization of the original information, potentially reducing the
accumulation of errors introduced during the image reconstruction process.
Inspired by these factors, this study proposes a prior-guided joint diffusion
model (PJDM) for transforming 18F-FDG PET images into 18F-DOPA PET images in
projection domain. Specifically, a coarse estimation model and a prior
refinement model are trained independently. During inference, an initial
synthetic 18F-DOPA PET sinogram is generated using a higher-order hybrid
sampler. This sinogram is then degraded and serves as an additional condition
to guide the iterative refinement process using learned prior. Experimental
results demonstrated that PJDM effectively improved both sinogram quality and
synthetic outcomes. The code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/PJDM.

Abstract: Infrared thermography faces persistent challenges in temperature accuracy due
to material emissivity variations, where existing methods often neglect the
joint optimization of radiometric calibration and image degradation. This study
introduces a physically guided neural framework that unifies temperature
correction and image enhancement through a symmetric skip-CNN architecture and
an emissivity-aware attention module. The pre-processing stage segments the
ROIs of the image and and initially corrected the firing rate. A novel
dual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between
the target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram
matching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically
fusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses
emissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the
industrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network
realizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial
background, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多潜在空间引导的纹理条件扩散变换模型（MS-CDT），用于PET成像中的示踪剂分离，首次结合纹理条件和多潜在空间，提升了图像细节和分离准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多示踪剂PET成像能提供更全面的生理和病理信息，但不同示踪剂信号难以区分，需要新方法解决这一问题。

Method: 结合扩散和变换器架构，引入纹理掩码作为条件输入，利用多潜在空间先验捕获多层次特征，平衡计算效率和细节保留。

Result: 在脑部和胸部3D PET数据集上，MS-CDT在图像质量和临床信息保留方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MS-CDT为PET示踪剂分离提供了高效且准确的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In clinical practice, single-radiotracer positron emission tomography (PET)
is commonly used for imaging. Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide
supplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological
function changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of
physiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by
positron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the
same energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this
study, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer
model (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent
space for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates
diffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,
with the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image
details. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,
the model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance
computational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as
conditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,
thereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image
textures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this
conditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer
separation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with
several advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest
scans. Experimental results indicate that MS-CDT achieved competitive
performance in terms of image quality and preservation of clinically relevant
information. Code is available at: https://github.com/yqx7150/MS-CDT.

Conclusion: RTDA能有效提升医学图像分类模型的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly being used to detect and diagnose
medical conditions using medical imaging. Despite their utility, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and distribution shifts, which can
affect diagnostic reliability and undermine trust among healthcare
professionals. In this study, we propose a robust training algorithm with data
augmentation (RTDA) to mitigate these vulnerabilities in medical image
classification. We benchmark classifier robustness against adversarial
perturbations and natural variations of RTDA and six competing baseline
techniques, including adversarial training and data augmentation approaches in
isolation and combination, using experimental data sets with three different
imaging technologies (mammograms, X-rays, and ultrasound). We demonstrate that
RTDA achieves superior robustness against adversarial attacks and improved
generalization performance in the presence of distribution shift in each image
classification task while maintaining high clean accuracy.

Result: MeDi能生成高质量的组织病理学图像，提升生成图像的保真度，并在子群体偏移的数据集上改善下游分类器的性能。

Conclusion: MeDi是减少数据偏见的生成模型概念验证，为临床实践提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models have made significant advances in histological
prediction tasks in recent years. However, for adaptation in clinical practice,
their lack of robustness to varying conditions such as staining, scanner,
hospital, and demographics is still a limiting factor: if trained on
overrepresented subpopulations, models regularly struggle with less frequent
patterns, leading to shortcut learning and biased predictions. Large-scale
foundation models have not fully eliminated this issue. Therefore, we propose a
novel approach explicitly modeling such metadata into a Metadata-guided
generative Diffusion model framework (MeDi). MeDi allows for a targeted
augmentation of underrepresented subpopulations with synthetic data, which
balances limited training data and mitigates biases in downstream models. We
experimentally show that MeDi generates high-quality histopathology images for
unseen subpopulations in TCGA, boosts the overall fidelity of the generated
images, and enables improvements in performance for downstream classifiers on
datasets with subpopulation shifts. Our work is a proof-of-concept towards
better mitigating data biases with generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GAN在有限医学影像数据集扩展中的潜力，尤其是对脑肿瘤分类任务的影响。

Method: 使用DCGAN生成合成图像，与真实图像按不同比例混合训练CNN，并在真实测试集上评估性能。

Result: 少量GAN数据（如100张）加入900张真实图像时，模型准确率达95.2%，但GAN比例过高时性能下降。

Conclusion: GAN可用于数据增强，但需控制合成数据比例以避免泛化能力下降。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have shown potential in expanding
limited medical imaging datasets. This study explores how different ratios of
GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN
in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic
images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.
The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results
indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor
classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a
small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN
images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching
95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the
proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.
This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets
especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce
artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的新框架，用于估计白质标准模型（SM）参数，解决了传统方法在高维模型和噪声条件下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高维模型和噪声条件下难以准确估计白质标准模型参数，因此需要一种更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 采用隐式神经表示（INR），通过正弦编码输入坐标实现空间正则化，无需标记训练数据。

Result: INR方法在低信噪比条件下表现出更高的参数估计准确性，并能连续表示解剖数据。

Conclusion: INR框架为扩散MRI数据分析提供了高效、稳健的工具，并具有广泛适应性。

Abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive
investigation of tissue microstructure. The Standard Model (SM) of white matter
aims to disentangle dMRI signal contributions from intra- and extra-axonal
water compartments. However, due to the model its high-dimensional nature,
extensive acquisition protocols with multiple b-values and diffusion tensor
shapes are typically required to mitigate parameter degeneracies. Even then,
accurate estimation remains challenging due to noise. This work introduces a
novel estimation framework based on implicit neural representations (INRs),
which incorporate spatial regularization through the sinusoidal encoding of the
input coordinates. The INR method is evaluated on both synthetic and in vivo
datasets and compared to parameter estimates using cubic polynomials,
supervised neural networks, and nonlinear least squares. Results demonstrate
superior accuracy of the INR method in estimating SM parameters, particularly
in low signal-to-noise conditions. Additionally, spatial upsampling of the INR
can represent the underlying dataset anatomically plausibly in a continuous
way, which is unattainable with linear or cubic interpolation. The INR is fully
unsupervised, eliminating the need for labeled training data. It achieves fast
inference ($\sim$6 minutes), is robust to both Gaussian and Rician noise,
supports joint estimation of SM kernel parameters and the fiber orientation
distribution function with spherical harmonics orders up to at least 8 and
non-negativity constraints, and accommodates spatially varying acquisition
protocols caused by magnetic gradient non-uniformities. The combination of
these properties along with the possibility to easily adapt the framework to
other dMRI models, positions INRs as a potentially important tool for analyzing
and interpreting diffusion MRI data.

Abstract: As conversational agents increasingly engage in emotionally supportive
dialogue, it is important to understand how closely their interactions resemble
those in traditional therapy settings. This study investigates whether the
concerns shared with a robot align with those shared in human-to-human (H2H)
therapy sessions, and whether robot responses semantically mirror those of
human therapists. We analyzed two datasets: one of interactions between users
and professional therapists (Hugging Face's NLP Mental Health Conversations),
and another involving supportive conversations with a social robot (QTrobot
from LuxAI) powered by a large language model (LLM, GPT-3.5). Using sentence
embeddings and K-means clustering, we assessed cross-agent thematic alignment
by applying a distance-based cluster-fitting method that evaluates whether
responses from one agent type map to clusters derived from the other, and
validated it using Euclidean distances. Results showed that 90.88% of robot
conversation disclosures could be mapped to clusters from the human therapy
dataset, suggesting shared topical structure. For matched clusters, we compared
the subjects as well as therapist and robot responses using Transformer,
Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings, revealing strong semantic overlap in subjects'
disclosures in both datasets, as well as in the responses given to similar
human disclosure themes across agent types (robot vs. human therapist). These
findings highlight both the parallels and boundaries of robot-led support
conversations and their potential for augmenting mental health interventions.

Abstract: Imagine unlocking the power of the mind to communicate, create, and even
interact with the world around us. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), especially in how machines "see" and "understand" language,
are now fueling exciting progress in decoding brain signals from scalp
electroencephalography (EEG). Prima facie, this opens the door to revolutionary
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed for real life, moving beyond
traditional uses to envision Brain-to-Speech, Brain-to-Image, and even a
Brain-to-Internet of Things (BCIoT).
  However, the journey is not as straightforward as it was for Computer Vision
(CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Applying AI to real-world EEG-based
BCIs, particularly in building powerful foundational models, presents unique
and intricate hurdles that could affect their reliability.
  Here, we unfold a guided exploration of this dynamic and rapidly evolving
research area. Rather than barely outlining a map of current endeavors and
results, the goal is to provide a principled navigation of this hot and
cutting-edge research landscape. We consider the basic paradigms that emerge
from a causal perspective and the attendant challenges presented to AI-based
models. Looking ahead, we then discuss promising research avenues that could
overcome today's technological, methodological, and ethical limitations. Our
aim is to lay out a clear roadmap for creating truly practical and effective
EEG-based BCI solutions that can thrive in everyday environments.

Conclusion: 监督学习可以克服传统超冷原子测温的局限性，有望实现量子气体实验的实时分析，提升测量精度并简化实验流程。

Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases
remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement
techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an
artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the
chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density
profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is
trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap
configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second.
The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry
and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters
for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite
no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining
predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively
brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These
results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations
in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric
configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially
enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such
capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst
improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins
such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their
function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore
conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full
protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom
protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from
molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural
network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein
conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,
sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent
representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by
dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a
2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor
in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy
reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT
of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone
and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of
less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route
to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing
a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic
targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to
facilitate further research.

Conclusion: 双重水印是解决水印技术误检问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Digital watermarking is a promising solution for mitigating some of the risks
arising from the misuse of automatically generated text. These approaches
either embed non-specific watermarks to allow for the detection of any text
generated by a particular sampler, or embed specific keys that allow the
identification of the LLM user. However, simultaneously using the same
embedding for both detection and user identification leads to a false detection
problem, whereby, as user capacity grows, unwatermarked text is increasingly
likely to be falsely detected as watermarked. Through theoretical analysis, we
identify the underlying causes of this phenomenon. Building on these insights,
we propose Dual Watermarking which jointly encodes detection and identification
watermarks into generated text, significantly reducing false positives while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Our experimental results validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: BEAT为黑盒环境下的后门攻击防御提供了有效解决方案，并展示了对抗自然后门（如越狱攻击）的潜力。

Abstract: Backdoor unalignment attacks against Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the
stealthy compromise of safety alignment using a hidden trigger while evading
normal safety auditing. These attacks pose significant threats to the
applications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service
(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can
only interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the
attack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the
backdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden
trigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce
BEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to
deactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed
the probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples
significantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious
probe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT
identifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion
in the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the
input. Our method addresses the challenges of sample-dependent targets from an
opposite perspective. It captures the impact of the trigger on the refusal
signal (which is sample-independent) instead of sample-specific successful
attack behaviors. It overcomes black-box access limitations by using multiple
sampling to approximate the output distribution. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various backdoor attacks and LLMs (including the closed-source
GPT-3.5-turbo), verifying the effectiveness and efficiency of our defense.
Besides, we also preliminarily verify that BEAT can effectively defend against
popular jailbreak attacks, as they can be regarded as 'natural backdoors'.

Result: 先进模型常表现出犯罪倾向（如误导性陈述），且识别欺骗行为的准确率仅41%。

Conclusion: 研究强调在大规模部署前需提升模型的对抗鲁棒性、行为对齐和安全性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in
complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic
understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic
interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal
potential across five dimensions: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological
Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured
crime scenarios adapted from classic films, we evaluate both criminal potential
and anti-crime ability of LLMs via role-play. Results show that
state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as
proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit
instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize
deceptive behavior with only 41% accuracy on average, revealing a striking
mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings
underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment,
and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

Abstract: A key challenge in security analysis is the manual evaluation of potential
security weaknesses generated by static application security testing (SAST)
tools. Numerous false positives (FPs) in these reports reduce the effectiveness
of security analysis. We propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve
the assessment of SAST findings. We investigate the ability of LLMs to reduce
FPs while trying to maintain a perfect true positive rate, using datasets
extracted from the OWASP Benchmark (v1.2) and a real-world software project.
Our results indicate that advanced prompting techniques, such as
Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, substantially improve FP detection.
Notably, some LLMs identified approximately 62.5% of FPs in the OWASP Benchmark
dataset without missing genuine weaknesses. Combining detections from different
LLMs would increase this FP detection to approximately 78.9%. Additionally, we
demonstrate our approach's generalizability using a real-world dataset covering
five SAST tools, three programming languages, and infrastructure files. The
best LLM detected 33.85% of all FPs without missing genuine weaknesses, while
combining detections from different LLMs would increase this detection to
38.46%. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to complement traditional
SAST tools, enhancing automation and reducing resources spent addressing false
alarms.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of natural language processing
(NLP)-based n-gram analysis and machine learning techniques to enhance malware
classification. We explore how NLP can be used to extract and analyze textual
features from malware samples through n-grams, contiguous string or API call
sequences. This approach effectively captures distinctive linguistic patterns
among malware and benign families, enabling finer-grained classification. We
delve into n-gram size selection, feature representation, and classification
algorithms. While evaluating our proposed method on real-world malware samples,
we observe significantly improved accuracy compared to the traditional methods.
By implementing our n-gram approach, we achieved an accuracy of 99.02% across
various machine learning algorithms by using hybrid feature selection technique
to address high dimensionality. Hybrid feature selection technique reduces the
feature set to only 1.6% of the original features.

TL;DR: GalCatDiff是一种基于扩散模型的天文学框架，结合图像特征和天体物理属性，显著提升了星系生成的质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星系生成方法依赖物理假设和参数调整，而数据驱动的生成模型通过学习观测数据提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: GalCatDiff采用增强的U-Net和Astro-RAB块，结合注意力机制与卷积操作，并利用类别嵌入实现类别特定生成。

Result: 实验表明，GalCatDiff在样本颜色和大小分布一致性上优于现有方法，生成的星系视觉逼真且物理一致。

Conclusion: GalCatDiff提升了星系模拟的可靠性，并可作为数据增强工具支持未来星系分类算法开发。

Abstract: Conventional galaxy generation methods rely on semi-analytical models and
hydrodynamic simulations, which are highly dependent on physical assumptions
and parameter tuning. In contrast, data-driven generative models do not have
explicit physical parameters pre-determined, and instead learn them efficiently
from observational data, making them alternative solutions to galaxy
generation. Among these, diffusion models outperform Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in quality and diversity.
Leveraging physical prior knowledge to these models can further enhance their
capabilities. In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in
astronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties
in the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced
U-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which
dynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure
global consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses
category embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high
computational costs of training separate models for each category. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms
existing methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size
distributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and
physically consistent. This framework will enhance the reliability of galaxy
simulations and can potentially serve as a data augmentor to support future
galaxy classification algorithm development.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RKHS的数据驱动算法，用于计算Koopman和Perron-Frobenius算子的谱特性，具有收敛性证明和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在L^2空间中处理Koopman算子时存在计算效率低和误差控制困难的问题，而RKHS提供了点预测、误差界限和更优的谱特性。

Method: 通过用户指定的核函数定义RKHS，开发了计算谱和伪谱的算法，避免了L^2空间中的大数据限制。

Result: 算法在多个高维数据集上验证了有效性，包括湍流通道流、蛋白质分子动力学等。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在RKHS中具有最优性，并公开在软件包SpecRKHS中。

Abstract: Data-driven spectral analysis of Koopman operators is a powerful tool for
understanding numerous real-world dynamical systems, from neuronal activity to
variations in sea surface temperature. The Koopman operator acts on a function
space and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.
However, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
offers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with
error bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and
more efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the
first general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing
spectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These
methods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and
spectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data
limits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a
user-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in
$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided
datasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct
adversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can
succeed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.
Notably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,
high-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and
high-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,
molecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and
Northern Hemisphere sea surface height. The algorithms are publicly available
in the software package $\texttt{SpecRKHS}$.

Motivation: 准确识别系统表示的需求不仅难以满足，还影响了形式化方法的可扩展性，导致模型过于复杂，难以用于有效决策。

Method: 采用概率模拟关系和随机系统的替代模型，避免了直接计算误差界限，从而提升可扩展性。

Result: 该方法在高维复杂非线性环境中有效，并在无限时域时序逻辑保证下展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过牺牲保守性换取可扩展性，该方法在复杂高维车辆交叉口案例中表现优异。

Abstract: The requirement for identifying accurate system representations has not only
been a challenge to fulfill, but it has compromised the scalability of formal
methods, as the resulting models are often too complex for effective decision
making with formal correctness and performance guarantees. Focusing on
probabilistic simulation relations and surrogate models of stochastic systems,
we propose an approach that significantly enhances the scalability and
practical applicability of such simulation relations by eliminating the need to
compute error bounds directly. As a result, we provide an abstraction-based
technique that scales effectively to higher dimensions while addressing complex
nonlinear agent-environment interactions with infinite-horizon temporal logic
guarantees amidst uncertainty. Our approach trades scalability for conservatism
favorably, as demonstrated on a complex high-dimensional vehicle intersection
case study.

Abstract: Potato late blight, caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans,
is one of the most devastating diseases affecting potato crops in the history.
Although conventional detection methods of plant diseases such as PCR and LAMP
are highly sensitive and specific, they rely on bulky and expensive laboratory
equipment and involve complex operations, making them impracticable for
point-of care diagnosis in the field. Here in this study, we report a portable
RPA-CRISPR based diagnosis system for plant disease, integrating smartphone for
acquisition and analysis of fluorescent images. A polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
microneedle patch was employed for sample extraction on the plant leaves within
one minute, the DNA extraction efficiency achieved 56 ug/mg, which is
approximately 3 times to the traditional CTAB methods (18 ug/mg). The system of
RPA-CRISPR-Cas12a isothermal assay was established to specifically target P.
infestans with no cross-reactivity observed against closely-related species (P.
sojae, P. capsici). The system demonstrated a detection limit of 2 pg/uL for P.
infestans genomic DNA, offering sensitivity comparable to that of benchtop
laboratory equipment. The system demonstrates the early-stage diagnosis
capability by achieving a approximately 80% and 100% detection rate on the
third and fourth day post-inoculation respectively, before visible symptoms
observed on the leaves. The smartphone-based "sample-to-result" system
decouples the limitations of traditional methods that rely heavily on
specialized equipment, offering a promising way for early-stage plant disease
detection and control in the field.

Conclusion: 该方法成功生成了近似Ricci平坦Kähler势，并揭示了其对复结构参数模的依赖关系。

Abstract: We outline a method to determine analytic K\"ahler potentials with associated
approximately Ricci-flat K\"ahler metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Key
ingredients are numerically calculating Ricci-flat K\"ahler potentials via
machine learning techniques and fitting the numerical results to Donaldson's
Ansatz. We apply this method to the Dwork family of quintic hypersurfaces in
$\mathbb{P}^4$ and an analogous one-parameter family of bi-cubic CY
hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^2\times\mathbb{P}^2$. In each case, a relatively
simple analytic expression is obtained for the approximately Ricci-flat
K\"ahler potentials, including the explicit dependence on the complex structure
parameter. We find that these K\"ahler potentials only depend on the modulus of
the complex structure parameter.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is gaining significant attention from academia
and industry. Fortunately, LAE naturally aligns with near-field communications
in extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. By leveraging near-field
beamfocusing, LAE can precisely direct beam energy to unmanned aerial vehicles,
while the additional distance dimension boosts overall spectrum efficiency.
However, near-field communications in LAE still face several challenges, such
as the increase in signal processing complexity and the necessity of
distinguishing between far and near-field users. Inspired by the large language
models (LLM) with powerful ability to handle complex problems, we apply LLM to
solve challenges of near-field communications in LAE. The objective of this
article is to provide a comprehensive analysis and discussion on LLM-empowered
near-field communications in LAE. Specifically, we first introduce fundamentals
of LLM and near-field communications, including the key advantages of LLM and
key characteristics of near-field communications. Then, we reveal the
opportunities and challenges of near-field communications in LAE. To address
these challenges, we present a LLM-based scheme for near-field communications
in LAE, and provide a case study which jointly distinguishes far and near-field
users and designs multi-user precoding matrix. Finally, we outline and

Motivation: 在未知信道模型的情况下，传统方法难以优化码率。本文旨在通过NPDs和极化码框架，实现输入分布的优化和实际编码方案的提升。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：训练阶段通过NPDs估计互信息并优化输入分布参数；推理阶段利用优化模型构建极化码，结合HY方案和列表解码提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实际编码性能间架起桥梁，具有实际通信系统的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the
application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables
simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while
providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The
proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,
treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input
samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to
estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and
optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves
a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training
phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step
estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the
improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI
estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is
used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto
(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding
to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and
finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution
is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit
error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for
block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in
real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and
practical coding performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNA数据存储中的同步错误（如插入和删除）是一个基本挑战，现有解码器计算复杂度高。需要一种低复杂度且高效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用神经极化解码器（NPD），仅需样本访问信道，无需显式信道模型，复杂度为O(AN log N)。

Result: NPD在删除和IDS信道上表现优异，接近最优解码性能，复杂度显著低于基于网格的解码器，并在实际DNA存储场景中匹配或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: NPD为DNA数据存储系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解码方案，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a
fundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both
synthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as
insertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing
maximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we
propose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design
low-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed
architecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN
log N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs
require only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an
explicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)
estimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS
channels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal
decoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower
complexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of
the channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to
realistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads
and real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or
surpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer
parameters than the state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the promise of
NPDs for robust and efficient decoding in DNA data storage systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态选择和整合多种检索器的方法（混合检索器），通过零样本加权组合，显著提升了检索增强生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常固定使用单一检索器，无法适应多样化的信息需求，因此需要一种动态选择和整合多检索器的方法。

Method: 提出混合检索器框架，通过零样本加权组合不同检索器（如BM25和密集检索器），无需人工干预。

Result: 混合检索器在参数仅为0.8B的情况下，平均性能分别优于单一检索器和7B模型10.8%和3.9%，并能与非专家人类检索器协作提升性能58.9%。

Conclusion: 混合检索器框架是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够动态整合多检索器信号，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness
hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct,
often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers,
semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based
on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can
we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual
query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this
intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a
zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive
experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite
totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual
retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average,
respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help
incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to
achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over
simulated humans alone.

Method: Revela通过语言建模目标训练检索器，利用局部和跨文档上下文的条件化下一词预测，并通过检索器计算的相似度分数加权注意力机制。

Result: 在通用领域（BEIR）和特定领域（CoIR）基准测试中，Revela在NDCG@10指标上分别提升了5.2%和5.6%，且性能随模型规模增加而提升。

Conclusion: Revela展示了自监督检索器学习的有效性和可扩展性，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized
knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically
requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in
specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised
retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies
through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we
can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens.
This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised
learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?
  To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training
framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela
models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token
prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch
attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed
similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language
modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific
(CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter
scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements
of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10,
respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model
size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for
self-supervised retriever learning.

Conclusion: GFlowGR通过解决曝光偏差问题，为生成推荐提供了一种有前景的微调方法。

Abstract: Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and
generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success
across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts
primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM
decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical
fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to
recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches
predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization
(DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive
unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem.
To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation
task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The
proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional
recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a
comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of
GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR
emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem.
Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different
GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR.

Abstract: Generative retrieval-based recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates.
However, in large-scale recommendation systems, this approach becomes
increasingly cumbersome due to the redundancy and sheer scale of the token
space. To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of
semantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged
reconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings
and significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive
quantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding
independently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks
focusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side
information of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical
knowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be
effective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for
interactions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary
knowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains
challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep
quantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple
Contrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing
reconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual
quantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the
items, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization
in a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments
across public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various
domains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative
recommendation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合经典规划与大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，以解决机器人规划中感知受限和动作落地问题，并通过功能等效目标逐步放松任务，实现适应性规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典规划方法在真实场景中因感知受限和动作落地问题表现不佳，而LLMs虽能利用常识推理但易生成不可行或不安全计划。

Method: 提出分层规划框架，结合LLMs的常识推理能力，通过逐步放松任务目标实现适应性规划。

Result: 在3D场景图中验证了方法的有效性，优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合经典规划与LLMs，显著提升了机器人规划的适应性和执行能力。

Abstract: Classical planning in AI and Robotics addresses complex tasks by shifting
from imperative to declarative approaches (e.g., PDDL). However, these methods
often fail in real scenarios due to limited robot perception and the need to
ground perceptions to planning predicates. This often results in heavily
hard-coded behaviors that struggle to adapt, even with scenarios where goals
can be achieved through relaxed planning. Meanwhile, Large Language Models
(LLMs) lead to planning systems that leverage commonsense reasoning but often
at the cost of generating unfeasible and/or unsafe plans. To address these
limitations, we present an approach integrating classical planning with LLMs,
leveraging their ability to extract commonsense knowledge and ground actions.
We propose a hierarchical formulation that enables robots to make unfeasible
tasks tractable by defining functionally equivalent goals through gradual
relaxation. This mechanism supports partial achievement of the intended
objective, suited to the agent's specific context. Our method demonstrates its
ability to adapt and execute tasks effectively within environments modeled
using 3D Scene Graphs through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations. We also show how this method succeeds in complex scenarios where
other benchmark methods are more likely to fail. Code, dataset, and additional
material are released to the community.

TL;DR: SafeMimic框架通过单次人类视频演示，让机器人安全自主地学习移动操作技能，减少探索需求并提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人从单次人类视频中学习移动操作任务的挑战，包括视角转换、形态适应和安全性问题。

Method: 解析视频为语义和动作段，转换为第一人称视角，采样候选动作并通过安全Q函数验证，回溯调整轨迹和抓取模式。

Result: 实验表明，SafeMimic能在不同用户和环境中安全高效地学习多步移动操作任务，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SafeMimic为机器人从人类演示中学习复杂任务提供了安全、自主且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: For robots to become efficient helpers in the home, they must learn to
perform new mobile manipulation tasks simply by watching humans perform them.
Learning from a single video demonstration from a human is challenging as the
robot needs to first extract from the demo what needs to be done and how,
translate the strategy from a third to a first-person perspective, and then
adapt it to be successful with its own morphology. Furthermore, to mitigate the
dependency on costly human monitoring, this learning process should be
performed in a safe and autonomous manner. We present SafeMimic, a framework to
learn new mobile manipulation skills safely and autonomously from a single
third-person human video. Given an initial human video demonstration of a
multi-step mobile manipulation task, SafeMimic first parses the video into
segments, inferring both the semantic changes caused and the motions the human
executed to achieve them and translating them to an egocentric reference. Then,
it adapts the behavior to the robot's own morphology by sampling candidate
actions around the human ones, and verifying them for safety before execution
in a receding horizon fashion using an ensemble of safety Q-functions trained
in simulation. When safe forward progression is not possible, SafeMimic
backtracks to previous states and attempts a different sequence of actions,
adapting both the trajectory and the grasping modes when required for its
morphology. As a result, SafeMimic yields a strategy that succeeds in the
demonstrated behavior and learns task-specific actions that reduce exploration
in future attempts. Our experiments show that our method allows robots to
safely and efficiently learn multi-step mobile manipulation behaviors from a
single human demonstration, from different users, and in different
environments, with improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across seven
tasks

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a prominent research
area, showcasing significant potential across a variety of applications.
However, their performance in endoscopy robotics, particularly endoscopy
capsule robots that perform actions within the digestive system, remains
unexplored. The integration of VLA models into endoscopy robots allows more

textual instructions, CapsDT can infer corresponding robotic control signals to
facilitate endoscopy tasks. In addition, we developed a capsule endoscopy robot
system, a capsule robot controlled by a robotic arm-held magnet, addressing
different levels of four endoscopy tasks and creating corresponding capsule
robot datasets within the stomach simulator. Comprehensive evaluations on
various robotic tasks indicate that CapsDT can serve as a robust
vision-language generalist, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various
levels of endoscopy tasks while achieving a 26.25% success rate in real-world
simulation manipulation.

Result: 在3公里路线上测试，PRISM-Loc在质量和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRISM-Loc在大型环境中定位高效且准确，适合移动机器人和自动驾驶车辆。

Abstract: Localization in the environment is one of the crucial tasks of navigation of
a mobile robot or a self-driving vehicle. For long-range routes, performing
localization within a dense global lidar map in real time may be difficult, and
the creation of such a map may require much memory. To this end, leveraging
topological maps may be useful. In this work, we propose PRISM-Loc -- a
topological map-based approach for localization in large environments. The
proposed approach leverages a twofold localization pipeline, which consists of
global place recognition and estimation of the local pose inside the found
location. For local pose estimation, we introduce an original lidar scan
matching algorithm, which is based on 2D features and point-based optimization.
We evaluate the proposed method on the ITLP-Campus dataset on a 3 km route, and
compare it against the state-of-the-art metric map-based and place
recognition-based competitors. The results of the experiments show that the
proposed method outperforms its competitors both quality-wise and
computationally-wise.

Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of sensor measurements coupled with deep
learning networks is crucial for many robotics systems, especially for
safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars. This paper develops an
uncertainty quantification approach in the context of visual localization for
autonomous driving, where locations are selected based on images. Key to our
approach is to learn the measurement uncertainty using light-weight sensor
error model, which maps both image feature and semantic information to
2-dimensional error distribution. Our approach enables uncertainty estimation
conditioned on the specific context of the matched image pair, implicitly
capturing other critical, unannotated factors (e.g., city vs highway, dynamic
vs static scenes, winter vs summer) in a latent manner. We demonstrate the
accuracy of our uncertainty prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset,
which includes variations in lighting and weather (sunny, night, snowy). Both
the uncertainty quantification of the sensor+network is evaluated, along with
Bayesian localization filters using unique sensor gating method. Results show
that the measurement error does not follow a Gaussian distribution with poor
weather and lighting conditions, and is better predicted by our Gaussian
Mixture model.

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂工业环境中难以准确检测工件缺陷，需要一种能适应多变条件的解决方案。

Method: 采用异构教师网络（HetNet）、自适应局部-全局特征融合模块和局部多元高斯噪声生成模块。

Result: HetNet在工业条件下性能提升约10%，并在其他数据集上达到最优结果。

Conclusion: HetNet能有效集成到生产线中，实现实时且鲁棒的异常检测。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in automated industrial manufacturing can
significantly enhance production efficiency and product quality. Existing
methods are capable of detecting surface defects in pre-defined or controlled
imaging environments. However, accurately detecting workpiece defects in
complex and unstructured industrial environments with varying views, poses and
illumination remains challenging. We propose a novel anomaly detection and
localization method specifically designed to handle inputs with perturbative
patterns. Our approach introduces a new framework based on a collaborative
distillation heterogeneous teacher network (HetNet), an adaptive local-global
feature fusion module, and a local multivariate Gaussian noise generation
module. HetNet can learn to model the complex feature distribution of normal
patterns using limited information about local disruptive changes. We conducted
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks. HetNet demonstrates superior
performance with approximately 10% improvement across all evaluation metrics on
MSC-AD under industrial conditions, while achieving state-of-the-art results on
other datasets, validating its resilience to environmental fluctuations and its
capability to enhance the reliability of industrial anomaly detection systems
across diverse scenarios. Tests in real-world environments further confirm that
HetNet can be effectively integrated into production lines to achieve robust
and real-time anomaly detection. Codes, images and videos are published on the
project website at: https://zihuatanejoyu.github.io/HetNet/

Result: 在RLBench基准测试中，FlowRAM平均成功率提升12.0%，且推理速度显著提高，仅需不到4个时间步。

Conclusion: FlowRAM在高精度任务中表现出色，为机器人操作提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in high-precision tasks is essential for numerous
industrial and real-world applications where accuracy and speed are required.
Yet current diffusion-based policy learning methods generally suffer from low
computational efficiency due to the iterative denoising process during
inference. Moreover, these methods do not fully explore the potential of
generative models for enhancing information exploration in 3D environments. In
response, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative
models to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal
information processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,
which allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene
comprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate
state space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear
computational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to
learn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the
learning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of
the FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a
remarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it
outperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate. Additionally,
FlowRAM is able to generate physically plausible actions for a variety of
real-world tasks in less than 4 time steps, significantly increasing inference
speed.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated impressive locomotion capabilities in
complex environments, but equipping them with autonomous versatile manipulation
skills in a scalable way remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
introduce a cross-embodiment imitation learning system for quadrupedal
manipulation, leveraging data collected from both humans and LocoMan, a
quadruped equipped with multiple manipulation modes. Specifically, we develop a
teleoperation and data collection pipeline, which unifies and modularizes the
observation and action spaces of the human and the robot. To effectively
leverage the collected data, we propose an efficient modularized architecture
that supports co-training and pretraining on structured modality-aligned data
across different embodiments. Additionally, we construct the first manipulation
dataset for the LocoMan robot, covering various household tasks in both
unimanual and bimanual modes, supplemented by a corresponding human dataset. We
validate our system on six real-world manipulation tasks, where it achieves an
average success rate improvement of 41.9% overall and 79.7% under
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings compared to the baseline. Pretraining with
human data contributes a 38.6% success rate improvement overall and 82.7% under
OOD settings, enabling consistently better performance with only half the

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that integrates Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs)
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive and goal-driven robotic
task execution in dynamic environments. The system decomposes natural language
instructions into structured action triplets, which are grounded in contextual
environmental data provided by the SDT. This semantic grounding allows the
robot to interpret object affordances and interaction rules, enabling action
planning and real-time adaptability. In case of execution failures, the LLM
utilizes error feedback and SDT insights to generate recovery strategies and
iteratively revise the action plan. We evaluate our approach using tasks from
the ALFRED benchmark, demonstrating robust performance across various household
scenarios. The proposed framework effectively combines high-level reasoning
with semantic environment understanding, achieving reliable task completion in
the face of uncertainty and failure.

Motivation: 世界模型在遇到训练中未见的视觉干扰物时表现脆弱，导致预测失效。

Method: ReOI通过检测干扰物、修改观测并重新预测，减少干扰影响。

Result: ReOI显著提升了任务成功率，在新型干扰物下表现优异。

Conclusion: ReOI是一种简单有效的策略，适用于开放世界中的机器人任务。

Abstract: World models enable robots to "imagine" future observations given current
observations and planned actions, and have been increasingly adopted as
generalized dynamics models to facilitate robot learning. Despite their
promise, these models remain brittle when encountering novel visual distractors
such as objects and background elements rarely seen during training.
Specifically, novel distractors can corrupt action outcome predictions, causing
downstream failures when robots rely on the world model imaginations for
planning or action verification. In this work, we propose Reimagination with
Observation Intervention (ReOI), a simple yet effective test-time strategy that
enables world models to predict more reliable action outcomes in open-world
scenarios where novel and unanticipated visual distractors are inevitable.
Given the current robot observation, ReOI first detects visual distractors by
identifying which elements of the scene degrade in physically implausible ways
during world model prediction. Then, it modifies the current observation to
remove these distractors and bring the observation closer to the training
distribution. Finally, ReOI "reimagines" future outcomes with the modified
observation and reintroduces the distractors post-hoc to preserve visual
consistency for downstream planning and verification. We validate our approach
on a suite of robotic manipulation tasks in the context of action verification,
where the verifier needs to select desired action plans based on predictions
from a world model. Our results show that ReOI is robust to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution visual distractors. Notably, it
improves task success rates by up to 3x in the presence of novel distractors,
significantly outperforming action verification that relies on world model
predictions without imagination interventions.

Conclusion: BIDA在动态交通条件下表现出卓越的安全性、效率和交互理性，为自动驾驶决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In complex real-world traffic environments, autonomous vehicles (AVs) need to
interact with other traffic participants while making real-time and
safety-critical decisions accordingly. The unpredictability of human behaviors
poses significant challenges, particularly in dynamic scenarios, such as
multi-lane highways and unsignalized T-intersections. To address this gap, we
design a bi-level interaction decision-making algorithm (BIDA) that integrates
interactive Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep reinforcement learning
(DRL), aiming to enhance interaction rationality, efficiency and safety of AVs
in dynamic key traffic scenarios. Specifically, we adopt three types of DRL
algorithms to construct a reliable value network and policy network, which
guide the online deduction process of interactive MCTS by assisting in value
update and node selection. Then, a dynamic trajectory planner and a trajectory
tracking controller are designed and implemented in CARLA to ensure smooth
execution of planned maneuvers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
BIDA not only enhances interactive deduction and reduces computational costs,
but also outperforms other latest benchmarks, which exhibits superior safety,
efficiency and interaction rationality under varying traffic conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化和可解释的中间表示，显著提升了机器人操作任务的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Natural language instructions for robotic manipulation tasks often exhibit
ambiguity and vagueness. For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug
tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches
to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on
end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and
low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to
their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks
specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a
Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language
instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable
intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception
module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by
integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities
in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of
current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and
environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging
manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and
multi-object interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前6D姿态估计依赖昂贵的深度传感器，且对透明物体效果不佳；单目深度估计模型（MDEMs）无法直接提供度量深度。

Method: 提出MOMA框架，通过一次校准实现度量深度恢复，利用稀疏真实深度点进行对齐，无需额外数据或模型重训练。

Result: MOMA在透明物体上表现良好，并在实际应用中（如抓取和分拣）取得高成功率。

Conclusion: MOMA是一种高效、通用的单目度量深度估计方法，适用于复杂场景和透明物体。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is a prerequisite for successfully
completing robotic prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation tasks. At
present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth
sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision,
which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras),
and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art
monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths
up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful
zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a
novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover
metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on
MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera
calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate
depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the
testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects,
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on
tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA
achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) challenges robots to find objects in
unseen environments, demanding sophisticated reasoning. While Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) show potential, current ObjectNav methods often employ them
superficially, primarily using vision-language embeddings for object-scene
similarity checks rather than leveraging deeper reasoning. This limits
contextual understanding and leads to practical issues like repetitive
navigation behaviors. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot ObjectNav
framework that pioneers the use of dynamic, history-aware prompting to more
deeply integrate VLM reasoning into frontier-based exploration. Our core
innovation lies in providing the VLM with action history context, enabling it
to generate semantic guidance scores for navigation actions while actively
avoiding decision loops. We also introduce a VLM-assisted waypoint generation
mechanism for refining the final approach to detected objects. Evaluated on the
HM3D dataset within Habitat, our approach achieves a 46% Success Rate (SR) and
24.8% Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). These results are comparable to
state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, demonstrating the significant potential of
our history-augmented VLM prompting strategy for more robust and context-aware
robotic navigation.

Abstract: Generating large-scale demonstrations for dexterous hand manipulation remains
challenging, and several approaches have been proposed in recent years to
address this. Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising
paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible
demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and
high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset
contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and
articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates
geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions
to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly
introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and
robustness through real-world robot experiments. Our project page is at

Abstract: Object handover is an important skill that we use daily when interacting with
other humans. To deploy robots in collaborative setting, like houses, being
able to receive and handing over objects safely and efficiently becomes a
crucial skill. In this work, we demonstrate the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) for dexterous object handover between two multi-finger hands. Key to this
task is the use of a novel reward function based on dual quaternions to
minimize the rotation distance, which outperforms other rotation
representations such as Euler and rotation matrices. The robustness of the
trained policy is experimentally evaluated by testing w.r.t. objects that are
not included in the training distribution, and perturbations during the
handover process. The results demonstrate that the trained policy successfully
perform this task, achieving a total success rate of 94% in the best-case
scenario after 100 experiments, thereby showing the robustness of our policy
with novel objects. In addition, the best-case performance of the policy
decreases by only 13.8% when the other robot moves during the handover, proving
that our policy is also robust to this type of perturbation, which is common in
real-world object handovers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DSRL的方法，通过强化学习在行为克隆（BC）策略的潜在噪声空间中进行调整，实现了高效的自适应策略改进。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，行为克隆策略初始表现不佳时，通常需要额外的人类演示来改进，成本高昂。强化学习虽能自主改进策略，但样本效率低。DSRL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DSRL在扩散策略（一种先进的BC方法）的潜在噪声空间中运行强化学习，无需修改基础策略权重，仅需黑盒访问BC策略。

Result: DSRL在模拟基准、真实机器人任务及预训练通用策略调整中表现出高样本效率和有效性能。

Conclusion: DSRL为快速自适应策略改进提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic control policies learned from human demonstrations have achieved
impressive results in many real-world applications. However, in scenarios where
initial performance is not satisfactory, as is often the case in novel
open-world settings, such behavioral cloning (BC)-learned policies typically
require collecting additional human demonstrations to further improve their
behavior -- an expensive and time-consuming process. In contrast, reinforcement
learning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy
improvement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of
samples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast
autonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.
Focusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC
methodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):
adapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that
DSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC
policy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.
Furthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning
diffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy
at all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,
and for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample
efficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement.

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) present a principled and interpretable
framework for learning the system dynamics by utilizing inductive biases. While
traditional dynamics models struggle with compounding errors over long
horizons, LNNs intrinsically preserve the physical laws governing any system,
enabling accurate and stable predictions essential for sustainable locomotion.
This work evaluates LNNs for infinite horizon planning in quadrupedal robots
through four dynamics models: (1) full-order forward dynamics (FD) training and
inference, (2) diagonalized representation of Mass Matrix in full order FD, (3)
full-order inverse dynamics (ID) training with FD inference, (4) reduced-order
modeling via torso centre-of-mass (CoM) dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that
LNNs bring improvements in sample efficiency (10x) and superior prediction
accuracy (up to 2-10x) compared to baseline methods. Notably, the
diagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while
retaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control.
These findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying
structure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and
efficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach
achieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating
its potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.
