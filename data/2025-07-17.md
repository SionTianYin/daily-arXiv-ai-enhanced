### [1] [Subjective Evaluation Profile Analysis of Science Fiction Short Stories and its Critical-Theoretical Significance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11582)
*Kazuyoshi Otsuka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究将大语言模型（LLMs）作为“主观文学评论家”，探索其在文学评估中的审美偏好和评价模式。通过分析十篇日本科幻短篇小说的翻译版本，发现LLMs在评价一致性和模式上存在显著差异，并揭示了其独特的评价词汇和潜在价值体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文学评估中的表现，揭示其是否具有类似人类批评流派的个体化评价特征，而非中立基准工具。

Method: 将十篇日本科幻小说翻译成英文，由六种先进LLMs进行七次独立评估，使用主成分分析和聚类技术分析评价模式和一致性。

Result: 发现评价一致性差异显著（α范围1.00至0.35），识别出五种评价模式，且不同模型的评价词汇具有独特性。

Conclusion: LLMs可能具有类似人类批评流派的个体化评价特征，而非单纯的中立评估工具。

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

### [2] [MapIQ: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Map Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11625)
*Varun Srivastava,Fan Lei,Srija Mukhopadhyay,Vivek Gupta,Ross Maciejewski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MapIQ基准数据集，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在地图视觉问答（Map-VQA）中的表现，填补了现有研究仅关注等值区域图的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Map-VQA研究主要局限于等值区域图，覆盖的主题类别和视觉分析任务有限，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 提出MapIQ数据集，包含14,706个问题-答案对，涵盖三种地图类型和六种主题，并评估多种MLLMs在六项视觉分析任务中的表现。

Result: 通过实验比较了MLLMs的性能与人类基准，并分析了地图设计变化对模型鲁棒性和敏感性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs在地图视觉问答中的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

### [3] [Cross-lingual Few-shot Learning for Persian Sentiment Analysis with Incremental Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11634)
*Farideh Majidi,Ziaeddin Beheshtifard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在波斯语中使用少样本学习和增量学习方法进行跨语言情感分析，旨在利用高资源语言知识开发适用于低资源语言的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够在数据有限的波斯语中进行情感分析的模型，同时利用高资源语言的知识。

Method: 使用三种预训练多语言模型（XLM-RoBERTa、mDeBERTa和DistilBERT），通过少样本和增量学习方法在波斯语小样本数据上进行微调。

Result: mDeBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa在波斯语情感分析中表现优异，准确率达到96%。

Conclusion: 结合少样本学习、增量学习和多语言预训练模型的方法在跨语言情感分析中非常有效。

Abstract: This research examines cross-lingual sentiment analysis using few-shot
learning and incremental learning methods in Persian. The main objective is to
develop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using
limited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To
achieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and
DistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental
learning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,
including X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled
the models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show
that the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%
accuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with
multilingual pre-trained models.

### [4] [Partitioner Guided Modal Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11661)
*Guimin Hu,Yi Xin,Lijie Hu,Zhihong Zhu,Hasti Seifi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PgM框架通过模态分割器将多模态表示分为单模态和配对模态特征，分别学习并重构，提升多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，单模态和配对模态特征的学习和调整对任务性能至关重要，但现有方法未充分区分和优化这两类特征。

Method: 提出PgM框架，包含模态分割器、单模态学习器、配对模态学习器和单-配对模态解码器，分别处理单模态和配对模态特征。

Result: 在四个多模态任务中验证了PgM的有效性，并展示了其对现有模型的迁移能力。

Conclusion: PgM通过区分和优化单模态与配对模态特征，提升了多模态学习的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

### [5] [ExpliCIT-QA: Explainable Code-Based Image Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11694)
*Maximiliano Hormazábal Lagos,Álvaro Bueno Sáez,Pedro Alonso Doval,Jorge Alcalde Vesteiro,Héctor Cerezo-Costas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpliCIT-QA是一个多模态表格问答系统，通过模块化设计提供可解释的答案，包括表格理解、语言推理、代码生成与执行，以及自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端表格问答系统中可解释性不足的问题，适用于金融和医疗等敏感领域。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括多模态表格理解、语言推理、自动代码生成、代码执行和自然语言解释。

Result: 在TableVQA-Bench基准测试中表现优于现有基线，提高了可解释性和透明度。

Conclusion: ExpliCIT-QA为敏感领域的表格问答系统提供了可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for
tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling
complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a
modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a
Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images;
(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

### [6] [CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11742)
*Meng Li,Timothy M. McPhillips,Dingmin Wang,Shin-Rong Tsai,Bertram Ludäscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRABS的方法，通过结合浅层语法分析和LLM，解决Python笔记本理解中的幻觉和长上下文问题，生成信息流图和执行依赖图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据科学和机器学习Python笔记本的依赖性问题，重新执行笔记本以理解其信息流和操作往往不切实际。现有的LLM方法因幻觉和长上下文问题难以完全理解笔记本。

Method: 提出CRABS策略，结合浅层语法分析（AST）和LLM，通过上下界估计和零样本学习解决笔记本理解问题。

Result: 在50个Kaggle笔记本上测试，LLM解决了98%的歧义，CRABS在信息流和执行依赖识别上分别达到98%和99%的F1分数。

Conclusion: CRABS方法有效解决了笔记本理解问题，为笔记本的评估和重用提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

### [7] [AI Wizards at CheckThat! 2025: Enhancing Transformer-Based Embeddings with Sentiment for Subjectivity Detection in News Articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11764)
*Matteo Fasulo,Luca Babboni,Luca Tedeschini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Wizards团队在CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab任务1中，通过结合情感分数增强Transformer模型，在多语言和零样本设置下检测新闻句子的主观性，取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在提升多语言和零样本环境下句子主观性检测的性能，特别是在未见语言上的泛化能力。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型（如mDeBERTaV3-base、ModernBERT-base和Llama3.2-1B），通过集成情感分数增强句子表示，并优化决策阈值以解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 情感特征显著提升了性能，尤其在主观F1分数上，团队在希腊语任务中排名第一（Macro F1 = 0.51）。

Conclusion: 情感增强的Transformer框架在多语言主观性检测任务中表现优异，尤其在未见语言上展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

### [8] [Tracing Facts or just Copies? A critical investigation of the Competitions of Mechanisms in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11809)
*Dante Campregher,Yanxu Chen,Sander Hoffman,Maria Heuss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过可重复性研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何处理相互矛盾的事实与反事实信息，重点关注注意力头的作用。研究验证了三个近期研究的发现，并提出了新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs如何通过注意力头机制处理矛盾信息，验证和调和现有研究的不同结论。

Method: 使用机制解释工具分析注意力头强度与事实输出比率的关系，评估注意力头的抑制机制假设，并研究其领域特异性。

Result: 研究发现，促进事实输出的注意力头通过通用复制抑制而非选择性反事实抑制实现，且其行为具有领域依赖性，较大模型表现出更专业和类别敏感的模式。

Conclusion: 结论表明注意力头的行为机制是通用的，但受模型规模和领域影响，为LLMs的机制解释提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

### [9] [ILID: Native Script Language Identification for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11832)
*Yash Ingle,Pruthwik Mishra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了语言识别任务的重要性，并针对印度语言的特殊挑战发布了一个包含23万句子的数据集和基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言识别是NLP的基础任务，尤其在多语言环境中面临噪声、短文本和代码混合的挑战，印度语言的相似性进一步增加了难度。

Method: 发布了一个包含英语和22种印度官方语言的23万句子数据集，并开发了基于机器学习和深度学习的基线模型。

Result: 基线模型在语言识别任务中表现与现有最佳模型相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为印度语言识别提供了新的数据集和模型，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

### [10] [Your LLM Knows the Future: Uncovering Its Multi-Token Prediction Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11851)
*Mohammad Samragh,Arnav Kundu,David Harrison,Kumari Nishu,Devang Naik,Minsik Cho,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过多令牌预测提升自回归语言模型的推理速度和并行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型的顺序生成特性限制了推理速度和并行性，尤其在文本方向和语义明确时。

Method: 结合掩码输入、门控LoRA、轻量采样器、辅助训练损失和推测生成策略，实现多令牌预测。

Result: 代码和数学生成速度提升近5倍，聊天和知识任务提升2.5倍，且质量无损失。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了生成效率，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

*Junhong Ye,Xu Yuan,Xinying Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了跨领域模型迁移、多领域数据融合和样本高效学习在个人身份信息（PII）识别中的效果，发现法律领域数据对传记文本迁移效果好，而医疗领域数据迁移效果差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过跨领域模型迁移、数据融合和少样本学习提高PII识别的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用来自医疗（I2B2）、法律（TAB）和传记（Wikipedia）的标注语料库，评估模型在领域内性能、跨领域迁移性、数据融合和少样本学习四个维度。

Result: 法律领域数据对传记文本迁移效果好，医疗领域数据迁移效果差；数据融合效果因领域而异；低专业化领域仅需10%训练数据即可实现高质量识别。

Conclusion: 跨领域迁移和数据融合的效果具有领域依赖性，少样本学习在低专业化领域表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient
learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2),
legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four
dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and
few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to
biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GEC和COLA任务共享语法知识但独立发展，研究旨在通过双向框架实现知识互补。

Method: 1. 使用GEC数据集增强语法可接受性模型；2. 通过动态损失函数将语法可接受性信号整合到GEC训练中。

Result: 在多语言基准测试中达到最优性能，但标点错误纠正仍有挑战。

Conclusion: COLA-GEC框架有效提升任务性能，未来需进一步优化语法建模，尤其是标点错误处理。

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment
(COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational
grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper
introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks
through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability
models using GEC datasets, significantly improving their performance across
multiple languages. Second, we integrate grammatical acceptability signals into
GEC model training via a dynamic loss function, effectively guiding corrections
toward grammatically acceptable outputs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis
highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction,
providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

*Tianyou Huang,Xinglu Chen,Jingshen Zhang,Xinying Qiu,Ruiying Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualReward是一种新颖的强化学习框架，用于自动生成填空题的干扰项，通过双奖励结构和自适应缩放机制优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要依赖监督学习或静态生成模型，无法动态区分人工标准干扰项和模型生成候选，因此需要一种更灵活的框架。

Method: 采用双奖励结构和自适应缩放机制，根据模型性能和置信度动态调整奖励信号强度。

Result: 在CLOTH-F和MCQ数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在跨域数据上提升显著（3.48-3.86% P@1）。

Conclusion: DualReward框架能有效平衡从可靠人工示例中学习与探索高质量干扰项，适用于自动化测试生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,
high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

### [14] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)
*Jiachen Zhao,Jing Huang,Zhengxuan Wu,David Bau,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs内部存在独立的“有害性”概念，与“拒绝”行为分离，可用于构建更鲁棒的安全机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs是否真正理解有害性，而不仅仅是机械拒绝。

Method: 通过识别“有害性”方向，分析其与“拒绝”方向的差异，并验证其对模型行为的影响。

Result: 发现“有害性”概念独立于拒绝行为，可用于开发Latent Guard，性能优于专用安全模型。

Conclusion: LLMs对有害性的内部理解比拒绝行为更鲁棒，为AI安全研究提供新视角。

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a

findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多语言版本的指令跟随评估基准Marco-Bench-MIF，覆盖30种语言，解决了现有数据集在语言和文化适应性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令跟随评估数据集多为英语或简单机器翻译，限制了多语言场景下的适用性。

Method: 通过结合翻译与验证的混合流程，创建了一个本地化的多语言基准Marco-Bench-MIF。

Result: 评估发现高低资源语言间存在25-35%的准确率差距，模型规模影响显著，机器翻译数据低估了7-22%的准确率。

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF揭示了多语言指令跟随的挑战，如关键词一致性和跨语言约束遵循，为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PolyChartQA是一个多语言图表问答基准，覆盖10种语言，旨在解决现有基准的英语中心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表理解基准主要针对英语，限制了全球用户的可用性。

Method: 采用解耦管道生成多语言图表，结合LLM翻译和严格质量控制。

Result: 实验显示英语与其他语言（尤其是非拉丁文字的低资源语言）存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: PolyChartQA为推进全球包容性视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

TL;DR: BlockBPE是一种并行GPU实现的BPE算法，优化了高吞吐量的批量推理，比现有方法快2-2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CPU绑定的BPE实现（如HuggingFace Tokenizers和tiktoken）在GPU批量推理中效率低下，需要优化。

Method: BlockBPE通过消除Regex预分词，实现高度并行化的线程块内合并，将复杂度降至O(nd)。

Result: 在高批量推理任务中，BlockBPE的吞吐量比tiktoken高2倍，比HuggingFace Tokenizers高2.5倍。

Conclusion: BlockBPE显著提升了GPU批量推理的效率，尽管牺牲了少量生成质量。

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力感知的任务无关提示压缩方法（DAC），通过结合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化，以实现细粒度的提示压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖信息熵作为压缩指标，忽略了算法层面注意力关键令牌的重要性以及压缩过程中信息熵的变化。

Method: 提出动态注意力感知方法（DAC），整合熵和注意力信息，动态感知压缩过程中的熵变化。

Result: 在多个领域（如LongBench、GSM8K和BBH）的实验表明，DAC在各种任务和LLMs中均表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: DAC方法在任务无关提示压缩中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

TL;DR: IAM框架通过利用不同规模LLM之间的注意力矩阵相似性，优化了注意力计算和KV缓存使用，提升了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在长上下文场景下资源消耗大，现有优化方法未充分利用外部信息。

Method: 通过分析注意力矩阵相似性，设计IAM框架，实现小规模与大规模LLM间的注意力映射。

Result: IAM加速预填充15%，减少KV缓存使用22.1%，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: IAM具有通用性，且与现有KV缓存优化方法正交，是提升LLM效率的有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的PoT量化框架，用于LLM权重，在极低精度下优于现有方法，并通过高效反量化加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs部署因计算资源需求大而困难，现有PoT量化在GPU上效果不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用两步后训练算法：初始化量化尺度并校准，优化PoT量化框架。

Result: 在2-和3-bit格式下超越现有整数量化方法，反量化速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 新型PoT量化框架在低精度下高效且准确，适合LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，用于在低资源语言对中保留毒性的翻译，以新加坡式英语（Singlish）为例，通过人工验证的少量提示工程和模型优化，提高了翻译质量和文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线交流中，标准翻译系统难以保留低资源语言和文化方言中的俚语、混合语及有害言论的文化标记，尤其是在毒性内容翻译中。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）人工验证的少量提示工程，筛选和排序标注者选定的Singlish-目标语言示例；2）通过语义相似度基准测试优化模型-提示对。

Result: 定量人工评估证实了该框架的有效性和效率，同时提升了翻译质量和多文化LLMs的安全性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提高了翻译质量，还支持低资源环境下的文化敏感内容审核和基准测试，强调了在内容审核和平台治理中保留社会语言细微差别的重要性。

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Conclusion: 研究为人类与AI的协同学习策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

Motivation: 探索人工社会中价值相似性是否像人类社会中一样影响关系建立。

Method: 通过两个实验：初步实验评估LLM中价值的可控性，主实验生成具有特定价值的代理对并分析其对话后的信任和亲密度。

Result: 价值相似性高的代理对表现出更高的相互信任和亲密度。

Conclusion: LLM代理模拟可作为社会科学理论的有效测试平台，并有助于理解价值如何影响关系建立。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

*Lukas Ellinger,Miriam Anschütz,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，简化定义会降低多义词的完整性，增加误解风险；通过微调模型可显著改善定义质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨简化定义对不同目标群体（如儿童或语言学习者）的影响，特别是在多义词（homonyms）定义中可能导致的误解。

Method: 使用两种新评估数据集，测试多个LLM模型（如DeepSeek v3、Llama 4等），结合LLM-as-Judge和人工标注。

Result: 简化定义显著降低了定义的完整性，尤其是多义词；微调Llama 3.1 8B模型显著提升了定义质量。

Conclusion: 教育NLP需平衡简洁性与完整性，以确保为所有学习者提供可靠且上下文感知的定义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

Conclusion: LLMs在语言创造力方面具有显著优势，但人类和LLMs在创造力类型上存在差异。

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the
classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the
classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach
follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了结合苏格拉底法、思维链推理、简化游戏化和形成性反馈的MEGA方法对大学生数学学习的影响，发现MEGA比传统方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多学生在数学学习中遇到困难，导致他们回避数学相关学科，而传统的教学方法可能不够优化。

Method: 采用组内设计，比较MEGA方法和传统思维链方法，使用GSM8K和MATH数据集评估两种大型语言模型（GPT4o和Claude 3.5 Sonnet）。

Result: 结果显示，MEGA方法在两种数据集上均被认为更有利于学习，尤其在较难的MATH数据集中表现更优（47.5% vs 26.67%）。

Conclusion: MEGA方法在解释复杂数学问题时表现更佳，是一种更有效的数学教学方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估框架，用于基于大语言模型（LLM）的文本增强，包括可扩展性分析和迭代增强与摘要细化（IASR），验证了其在提升语义保真度和多样性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本增强技术在语义保留方面的不足，特别是在大规模或迭代生成时导致的冗余和不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出了一个评估框架，包含可扩展性分析和IASR，用于衡量语义一致性和递归释义中的语义漂移。

Result: 实验表明，GPT-3.5 Turbo在语义保真度、多样性和生成效率方面表现最佳，应用于BERTopic任务时，主题粒度提升了400%，并完全消除了主题重叠。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM增强文本提供了结构化评估方法，验证了其在实际NLP任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT的Sensemaking任务通过三步评估生成模型的理解能力：问题生成、回答和评分，发现当前方法在问题质量评估和答案限制方面存在问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为生成语言模型建立可测试的高层次评估标准，特别是在多语言和多来源材料的背景下。

Method: 采用三步评估流程（问题生成、回答、评分），结合自动和手动评估方法，测试了多种语言和材料来源。

Result: 发现当前方法在问题生成质量评估和答案限制方面存在问题，LLM在回答任务中表现尚可，但评分任务中易受干扰影响。

Conclusion: 需改进问题生成和评分策略，尤其是提升对输入材料的严格遵循能力。

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种行为翻译风格空间（BTSS），用于描述行为翻译模式，并通过眼动和手指运动等行为数据揭示隐藏的认知过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过观察翻译行为（如眼动和手指运动）来理解其背后的高阶认知和情感状态，从而构建一个多层次的BTSS模型。

Method: 通过分析击键和凝视数据，构建了一个分层的BTSS模型，用于模拟翻译过程中的情感、自动行为和认知动态。

Result: BTSS模型能够作为计算翻译代理的基础，模拟人类翻译生产中的时间动态。

Conclusion: BTSS为理解和模拟翻译行为中的认知和情感过程提供了新的框架。

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索了一种在低资源环境下无需自动语音识别（ASR）的孤立词阅读评估方法，通过少量样本对比儿童语音与成人参考模板，发现自监督学习（SSL）特征在处理儿童数据时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源环境中，传统ASR方法难以适用，因此需要探索无需ASR的评估方法，尤其是针对儿童语音的评估。

Method: 使用少量样本对比儿童语音与成人参考模板，采用自监督学习（SSL）模型的中间层编码，并研究离散化SSL特征和模板的质心平均等设计选项。

Result: 实验显示，成人语音表现良好，但儿童语音输入效果显著下降，即使使用儿童模板。

Conclusion: 尽管SSL表征在低资源语音任务中表现成功，但在少量样本分类系统中处理儿童数据时存在明显局限性。

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

*Shilin Zhou,Zhenghua Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合了词级和短语级融合的优势，利用LLM提升ASR的关键词识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在识别上下文相关关键词（如专有名词或用户特定实体）时表现不佳，而现有方法在粒度上各有局限。

Method: 提出了一种多粒度融合方法，结合词级和短语级融合，并采用后融合策略将ASR的声学信息与LLM的上下文知识结合。

Result: 在中英文数据集上实现了关键词相关指标的最优性能，同时保持非关键词文本的高准确率。

Conclusion: 多粒度融合框架中词级和短语级组件相互补充，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译质量量化指标T-index，通过对比微调的语言模型计算，能有效评估翻译文本的翻译特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有翻译质量评估指标（如BLEU、COMET）无法全面衡量翻译特性（translationese），需要一种新的量化方法。

Method: 使用两个对比微调的语言模型（0.5B参数）计算T-index，并通过合成数据和真实翻译数据验证其有效性。

Result: T-index在跨领域和人工评估中表现稳健，与人工评分相关性较高（Pearson's r=0.568），且与现有MT QE指标相关性低。

Conclusion: T-index是一种高效且通用的翻译特性量化指标，可作为现有MT QE指标的补充。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Infherno的端到端框架，利用LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，将非结构化临床笔记转换为结构化FHIR资源，解决了现有方法的泛化性和结构一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（基于规则的系统或LLM）在将自由格式临床笔记转换为FHIR资源时存在泛化性差和结构不一致的问题。

Method: 提出Infherno框架，结合LLM代理、代码执行和医学术语数据库工具，实现端到端的转换。

Result: Infherno在预测FHIR资源方面表现优异，接近人类基准水平，并支持临床数据集成和跨机构互操作性。

Conclusion: Infherno框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为临床数据集成和互操作性提供了可行方案。

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

Conclusion: 通过开源基准工具包，为未来文本异常检测系统的研究提供了基础，并提出了高效的模型评估策略。

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用代码任务中表现优异，但在硬件描述语言（如VHDL）中的研究和优化仍不足，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CoDes方法，通过生成一系列中间描述步骤（基于问题陈述或VHDL代码）并将其与原始输入结合，以提升LLMs的性能。

Result: 实验表明，CoDes方法在多个指标上显著优于标准提示策略，有效提升了VHDL代码生成和摘要的质量。

Conclusion: CoDes不仅改善了VHDL任务的性能，还为未来优化代码LLMs提供了框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

Result: 男性语音更频繁被识别为AD，shimmer值与AD感知显著相关，语言对AD感知无显著影响。

Conclusion: 性别偏见在AD语音感知中起关键作用，需在模型开发中加以解决，并进一步验证跨语言性能。

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架是增强LLM能力的有效方法，为开发更鲁棒和自适应的语言理解系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖静态数据，而新能力使其能实时获取网络信息，但社交媒体数据的直接检索和分析尚未被研究。

Method: 使用合成数据集（48个X账户）和调查数据集（1,384名国际参与者），评估LLMs访问社交媒体内容并预测用户 demographics 的能力。

Result: LLMs能合理准确地预测用户 demographics，但可能引入性别和政治偏见，尤其对低活跃账户。

Conclusion: 此能力对计算社会科学有益，但也存在滥用风险，建议限制公开访问，仅保留给验证研究用途。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

Motivation: 探索语言模型内部激活是否能有效检测算术错误，为模型自我纠正提供轻量级解决方案。

Method: 从3位数加法开始，训练简单探针解码隐藏状态；扩展到结构化思维链任务，训练轻量级错误检测器；通过选择性重新提示改进任务准确性。

Result: 探针能准确解码模型预测和正确答案；错误检测器准确率超90%；探针在复杂任务中泛化良好；选择性重新提示提高任务准确性。

Conclusion: 算术错误可通过内部激活预测，简单探针为模型自我纠正提供可行路径。

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的RAG框架，结合混合检索策略和元数据过滤，显著提升了企业数据处理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业依赖专有数据进行决策，但现有LLMs和RAG框架在处理结构化数据时存在局限性。

Method: 采用混合检索（dense embeddings和BM25）、元数据过滤、语义分块和量化索引，结合人工反馈优化。

Result: 实验显示Precision@5提升15%，Recall@5提升13%，Faithfulness等定性指标显著提高。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了企业任务的响应质量，未来将扩展至多模态数据和基于代理的检索。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过线性探针分析思维链（CoT）的激活状态，可以更准确地预测最终输出的安全性，优于基于文本的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨思维链（CoT）是否可用于预测最终输出的对齐风险，以减少有害内容的生成。

Method: 评估多种监测方法，包括人类、大型语言模型和文本分类器，比较基于CoT文本和激活状态的预测效果。

Result: 线性探针在CoT激活状态上的表现显著优于文本方法，且能在推理完成前做出准确预测。

Conclusion: 轻量级探针可实现实时安全监测，适用于不同模型和任务。

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

TL;DR: S2WTM通过使用球形切片Wasserstein距离解决VAE-NTMs中的后验崩溃问题，提升主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAE-NTMs中因KL散度项消失导致的后验崩溃问题，同时保持超球面潜在空间结构。

Method: 提出S2WTM，利用球形切片Wasserstein距离对齐后验分布与先验分布。

Result: S2WTM在生成主题的连贯性和多样性上优于现有模型，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: S2WTM有效解决了后验崩溃问题，同时优化了主题建模效果。

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索显式优化数据选择目标的效果，以解决实践中隐式目标优化的问题。

Method: 提出BETR方法，通过嵌入基准示例和预训练文档到共享空间，基于相似性评分选择数据，并训练轻量级分类器预测全量数据。

Result: 实验表明，BETR在10个任务中的9个上表现优于基线，计算效率提升2.1倍。此外，BETR在多样化基准上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 结论表明，直接匹配预训练数据与目标任务能精确塑造模型能力，且数据选择策略需随模型规模调整。

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形注意力变换器（DAT）在计算机视觉任务中表现优异，但其数据依赖的采样机制导致不规则内存访问模式，难以高效部署硬件。现有方法要么硬件开销高，要么牺牲模型精度。

Method: 提出基于神经架构搜索（NAS）的方法，通过新的切片策略自动划分输入特征为均匀块，避免内存冲突；同时设计FPGA验证系统测试性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，精度仅下降0.2%；在Xilinx FPGA上，DRAM访问次数减少至现有方法的18%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高精度的同时显著提升了硬件效率，适用于边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕捉时空异质性和扩展性上的局限性，特别是GNN需要预定义邻接矩阵且难以扩展到大尺度数据的问题。

Method: DDCN通过动态应用基于偏移的可变形滤波器，分解为编码器-解码器结构，并在编码器中引入空间和时空注意力块以突出重要特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，DDCN具有竞争性的性能，验证了CNN方法在时空交通预测中的潜力。

Conclusion: DDCN通过动态可变形卷积和注意力机制，实现了高效且准确的交通预测，为基于CNN的方法提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

Motivation: 现有对齐方法计算成本高且可能影响模型性能，Inversion-DPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用DDIM反演重新定义Direct Preference Optimization，避免奖励建模，实现高效后训练。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和组合图像生成任务中表现优异，生成高保真且组合一致的图像。

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO为扩散模型的高效对齐提供了新途径，适用于复杂生成任务。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型（LLMs）在时空预测中表现有限，无法捕捉丰富的时空相关性。视觉基础模型（VFMs）虽然具有强大的空间先验，但缺乏时间建模能力。

Method: ST-VFM采用双分支架构，结合原始时空输入和辅助时空流输入，并通过预VFM和后VFM两个重新编程阶段处理数据，增强时空建模能力。

Result: 在十个时空数据集上的实验表明，ST-VFM优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ST-VFM是一个强大的通用框架，适用于时空预测任务，且兼容多种VFM骨干网络。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Motivation: 传统单生成器GAN模型难以捕捉水下图像的多样化退化问题，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: 提出xOp-GAN，包含多个专家生成器网络，每个生成器针对特定质量范围的图像进行训练，判别器在推理阶段选择最佳恢复结果。

Result: 在LSUI数据集上，xOp-GAN的PSNR达到25.16 dB，显著优于单回归器模型。

Conclusion: xOp-GAN通过多生成器架构和判别器辅助推理，显著提升了水下图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

Motivation: 步态年龄估计在医疗、安全和人机交互中有重要应用，但现有方法的性能差异和实际应用中的挑战需要系统性评估。

Method: 综述59项研究，分析大规模数据集（如OU-ISIR和VersatileGait），使用卷积神经网络（ResNet34）和支持向量机等方法进行实验。

Result: 多传感器融合误差最低（3.4年），深度网络准确率达96%，处理速度低于0.1秒/样本。步态特征与年龄的相关系数至少为0.27。

Conclusion: 通过综合分析和实验，本文为步态年龄估计提供了性能基准和实用指南，目标是将误差降至3年以下。

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet

Conclusion: VAE-MLP模型在淋巴结转移分期中表现出色，优于现有方法，且潜在空间更具可解释性。

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques

*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA是一种新颖的全局定位框架，通过对象分割和跟踪以及子图对应搜索，解决了视角变化和季节变化带来的挑战，无需特定领域训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无结构环境中，传统定位方法因视角变化、季节变化等问题表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合对象分割跟踪管道和子图对应搜索，利用几何一致性对齐参考帧。

Result: 在季节和斜视角数据集上，召回率提升69%，地图大小仅为基准方法的0.6%。

Conclusion: VISTA在多样环境下表现优异，适合资源受限平台实时应用。

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

*Maciej Szankin,Vidhyananth Venkatasamy,Lihang Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了多模态视觉语言模型（VLMs）与传统CNN-based OCR在户外广告文本识别中的表现，发现VLMs在整体场景理解上更优，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外广告文本识别在复杂场景中仍具挑战性，传统OCR方法在噪声环境下表现不佳，而新兴的VLMs可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 系统评估了Qwen 2.5 VL 3B、InternVL3和SmolVLM2等VLMs与PaddleOCRv4（CNN-based）在两个公开数据集（ICDAR 2015和SVT）上的性能，并添加了合成天气噪声以模拟真实场景。

Result: VLMs在整体场景理解上表现优异，但轻量级CNN在裁剪文本识别上仍具竞争力且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VLMs适用于复杂场景，而轻量级CNN更适合边缘部署；公开了天气增强的基准测试和评估代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

Result: UCGS通过单轮多任务训练，展示了在多种抽象视觉推理任务中的推理能力，并具备零样本推理能力。

Conclusion: UCGS为抽象视觉推理任务提供了一种统一的解决方案，减少了任务特定设计的成本，并展示了零样本推理的潜力。

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

TL;DR: CorrMoE提出了一种新的对应点修剪框架，通过去风格化双分支和双融合专家混合模块，提升了跨域和跨场景变化下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理密集对应点集时，通常假设视觉域一致，忽视了多样场景结构带来的挑战。

Method: 采用去风格化双分支处理域偏移，通过风格混合减少域特定表征的负面影响；设计双融合专家混合模块，自适应整合多视角特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CorrMoE表现出优于现有方法的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrMoE为跨域和跨场景的对应点修剪提供了有效解决方案，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: ProtoConNet通过整合背景信息增强特征空间多样性，提出了一种原型增强与对齐方法，用于开放集少样本图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖单张图像的视觉信息，忽略了上下文信息的整合，导致在少样本场景下表现不佳。

Method: ProtoConNet包含三个模块：聚类数据选择（CDS）挖掘多样数据模式，上下文增强语义细化（CSR）整合背景信息，原型对齐（PA）缩小图像表示与类原型的差距。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，ProtoConNet在少样本场景下提升了表示学习效果，并能有效识别开放集样本。

Conclusion: ProtoConNet优于现有方法，通过整合上下文信息提升了开放集少样本分类的性能。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用文本中的情感线索，且缺乏有效机制过滤与情感无关的面部动态。

Method: GRACE结合了粗到细的文本增强（CATE）、运动差异加权机制和基于熵正则化的最优传输跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，GRACE在模糊或不平衡情感类别中表现优异，达到新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: GRACE通过多模态对齐和细粒度表示，有效解决了动态面部表情识别的关键问题。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间频率调制（SFM）方法，通过调制高频特征以降低频率，再通过解调恢复细节，有效减少下采样时的混叠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信息对语义分割精度至关重要，但下采样层可能导致混叠或失真。

Method: 采用自适应重采样（ARS）调制高频特征，设计轻量级模块和多尺度自适应上采样（MSAU）解调。

Result: 方法有效减少混叠并保留细节，适用于多种任务和架构。

Conclusion: SFM方法在多种任务中表现出广泛适用性和有效性。

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

Motivation: 事件传感器在行人监测中表现优异，但相关数据稀缺，SEPose旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用CARLA模拟器和动态视觉传感器生成合成数据集SEPose，包含多种场景下的行人姿态数据。

Result: SEPose包含近350K标注行人，支持现有模型（如RVT和YOLOv8）的训练，并展示了模拟到现实的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEPose为基于事件的行人姿态估计提供了丰富的数据支持，推动了相关领域的研究。

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相机在低光环境下难以捕捉清晰多视角图像，事件相机和高斯泼溅技术虽有潜力，但直接结合仍面临噪声、帧质量和色调问题。

Method: 提出Dark-EvGS框架，采用三重监督学习、色调匹配模块，并构建首个真实数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低光条件下优于现有方法，成功重建辐射场。

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS为低光环境下的多视角图像重建提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

Motivation: 心理可视化是人类认知的核心能力，但现有基准主要评估被动视觉感知，缺乏对主动构建视觉模式能力的评估。

Method: 设计了四个程序生成的拼图任务，分三个难度级别，评估MLLMs的心理可视化能力，并探索强化学习的改进潜力。

Result: 当前MLLMs在心理可视化任务中表现显著低于人类，部分模型能识别视觉模式，但整体能力有限。

Conclusion: 心理可视化是当前MLLMs的未解决挑战，未来研究需进一步探索提升模型能力的途径。

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成多实例图像时，难以处理实例间的关系差异和多个属性的泄漏问题，限制了生成图像的质量。

Method: RaDL通过可学习参数增强实例特定属性，并利用全局提示中的动作动词生成关系感知的图像特征。

Result: 在COCO-Position、COCO-MIG和DrawBench等基准测试中，RaDL在位置准确性、多属性考虑和实例关系方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RaDL是生成多实例图像时同时考虑实例关系和多个属性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Conclusion: PPAR有效解决了语义分割的泛化问题，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

<details>

Motivation: 解决云边协作框架中云去噪时间过长和语义模糊问题。

Method: 提出K步噪声近似策略和两阶段贪心搜索算法。

Result: 生成质量显著提升，推理速度平均提升2倍。

Conclusion: EC-Diff在质量和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MPAE的无监督部分发现方法，通过学习部分描述符和特征图，利用掩码图像恢复技术，实现跨类别和场景的鲁棒部分发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督部分发现方法因缺乏细粒度标签且难以跨类别和场景保持鲁棒性，限制了其应用范围。

Method: MPAE通过学习部分描述符和特征图，利用掩码图像恢复技术，通过局部特征与描述符的相似性填充掩码区域，实现部分发现。

Result: MPAE在各种类别和场景中鲁棒地发现了与实际物体形状紧密匹配的有意义部分。

Conclusion: MPAE通过更有效的约束条件，实现了跨类别和场景的无监督部分发现，为处理遮挡和探索跨类别部分相似性提供了基础。

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在风格个性化时存在潜在空间纠缠和插值不平滑问题，难以实现区域化风格控制。

Method: 在去噪过程中融合不同风格模型的潜在空间，利用空间掩码实现区域化风格混合，并引入深度图条件增强结构一致性。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法能根据掩码成功实现区域化风格混合。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留各风格保真度的同时，实现了用户引导的区域化风格控制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

TL;DR: ID-EA框架通过ID-Enhancer和ID-Adapter改进文本嵌入与视觉身份嵌入的对齐，显著提升个性化肖像生成中的身份一致性，同时计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Textual Inversion方法在个性化肖像生成中难以保持面部身份一致性，主要由于文本与视觉嵌入空间的语义不对齐。

Method: ID-EA包含ID-Enhancer（整合身份嵌入与文本ID锚点）和ID-Adapter（调整文本条件以保持身份），优化预训练UNet模型的交叉注意力模块。

Result: ID-EA在身份保留指标上显著优于现有方法，生成速度提高约15倍。

Conclusion: ID-EA为个性化肖像生成提供了一种高效且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

Result: 在Potsdam数据集上的实验验证了SAMST的有效性和可行性。

Conclusion: SAMST通过结合大模型的泛化能力和小模型的训练效率，解决了遥感语义分割中标记数据不足的挑战。

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: AUBlendSet和AUBlendNet在3D面部动画任务中具有重要潜力，填补了相关领域的空白。

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于电路理论的频率动态注意力调制（FDAM）方法，通过注意力反转和频率动态缩放，解决了ViTs中频率消失的问题，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs的注意力机制导致频率消失，丢失关键细节和纹理，需要一种方法来动态调整频率响应。

Method: 提出FDAM，包含注意力反转（AttInv）和频率动态缩放（FreqScale），动态调制ViTs的频率响应。

Result: 在多种模型和任务中（如语义分割、目标检测）表现提升，并在遥感检测中达到最优。

Conclusion: FDAM有效解决了ViTs的频率消失问题，提升了模型性能，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法仅将掩码视为图像变形，缺乏理论分析，未能充分利用掩码重建在特征提取中的潜力。

Method: 将掩码重建视为稀疏信号问题，提出MaskTwins框架，通过互补掩码一致性增强特征提取。

Result: 实验表明MaskTwins在自然和生物图像分割中优于基线方法，无需单独预训练即可提取域不变特征。

Conclusion: MaskTwins为域自适应分割提供了新范式，展示了掩码重建在特征学习中的优势。

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Result: 模型成功预测了视觉皮层及其周围体素的活动，并通过显著性图识别出贡献最大的脑区（如中枕区、梭状回和距状沟）。

Conclusion: 研究表明深度学习模型可以作为理解视觉处理的工具，尤其是在边缘、面部和对比度重建方面。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于解耦-耦合策略的SS-DC框架，用于解决可见光到红外（RGB-IR）领域的无监督域自适应目标检测问题。通过光谱分解方法解耦域不变和域特定特征，并结合空间-光谱耦合方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将RGB域视为统一域，忽略了其内部的多个子域（如白天、夜晚、雾天场景），解耦域不变和域特定特征有助于提升RGB-IR域适应性能。

Method: 设计了光谱自适应幂等解耦（SAID）模块，通过基于滤波器组的光谱处理范式和自蒸馏驱动的解耦损失实现特征解耦；提出空间-光谱耦合方法，结合解耦的域特定特征减少域偏差。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了基线性能，并在多个RGB-IR数据集上优于现有UDAOD方法。

Conclusion: SS-DC框架通过解耦-耦合策略有效提升了RGB-IR域自适应目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

Conclusion: DOV4MM为掩码模型的数据集所有权验证提供了首个可行方案，保护了数据集所有者的权益。

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the

efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the

from ScanQA and ScanRefer, 3D-MoRe generates 62,000 question-answer (QA) pairs
and 73,000 object descriptions across 1,513 scenes. We also employ various data

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IICMVNCD的新框架，首次在多视图数据中探索新类发现（NCD），解决了现有方法在单视图数据和伪标签依赖上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCD方法主要针对单视图数据，且依赖伪标签导致性能不稳定，无法适应多视图数据（如多组学数据集）的需求。

Method: 提出IICMVNCD框架，通过矩阵分解在视图内捕获分布一致性，利用视图间关系指导新类聚类，并动态调整视图权重。

Conclusion: IICMVNCD在多视图NCD任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

it offers the flexibility and extensibility researchers need to develop and
experiment with new methods.

TL;DR: InstructFLIP是一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的指令调优框架，通过文本指导增强跨域泛化能力，显著减少训练冗余，并在人脸反欺骗（FAS）任务中超越现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸反欺骗中攻击类型语义理解不足和跨域训练冗余两大挑战。

Method: 结合VLM增强视觉输入感知，采用元域策略学习统一模型，并明确将指令解耦为内容和风格两部分。

Result: 在多个域上表现出色，准确率超越SOTA模型，并大幅减少训练冗余。

Conclusion: InstructFLIP通过指令调优和VLM的结合，显著提升了FAS任务的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-DETR是一个联合学习框架，通过捕捉视频中的运动-语义特征，提升视频时刻检索和高光检测任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR框架在视频内容中未充分利用时间运动和空间语义的复杂关系，MS-DETR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过编码器显式建模运动与语义的模态内相关性，解码器利用任务间相关性进行精确定位；采用生成策略和对比去噪学习解决数据稀疏问题。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，MS-DETR显著优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: MS-DETR通过统一学习运动-语义特征，为视频时刻检索和高光检测任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法直接预测未来轨迹，缺乏对行为意图的显式建模，影响了预测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 采用逆向强化学习（IRL）推理行为意图，结合查询中心范式聚合场景特征，通过分层DETR解码器生成轨迹。

Result: 在Argoverse和nuScenes数据集上表现优异，显著提升了预测置信度和性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模行为意图和奖励驱动的方法，显著提高了运动预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Motion forecasting for on-road traffic agents presents both a significant
challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂现实SMOT问题中表现出先进性和有效性，代码将开源。

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

Motivation: 全球变暖加剧热浪威胁，但现有路线规划系统缺乏阴影信息。由于卫星图像噪声大且训练数据有限，阴影估计成为挑战。

Method: 1. 构建包含多样地理区域和城市布局的数据集，利用Blender模拟建筑阴影；2. 提出DeepShade模型，结合RGB和Canny边缘层，通过对比学习捕捉阴影时间变化。

Result: 模型在生成阴影图像上表现优异，并通过实际案例（如亚利桑那州坦佩的路线规划）验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为极端高温天气下的城市规划提供了参考，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割网络在有限和不完美的数据集上容易误分类前景和背景对象，OoD数据在其他视觉任务中表现优异，因此探索其在医学分割中的应用。

Method: 提出Med-OoD框架，将OoD数据监督引入全监督医学分割，无需外部数据、特征正则化目标或额外标注，且无需修改网络架构。

Result: 实验表明，Med-OoD显著减少像素误分类，在Lizard数据集上性能大幅提升，甚至仅用OoD数据训练的网络达到76.1% mIoU。

Conclusion: Med-OoD展示了OoD数据在医学分割中的潜力，提出了一种新的学习范式，鼓励重新思考OoD数据的作用。

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的对抗性人脸生成方法，利用FRS特征空间的结构特性，通过单次非自适应查询实现高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对人脸识别系统（FRS）的安全和隐私威胁，尤其是身份验证场景中的对抗攻击问题。

Method: 利用FRS特征空间中共享属性的子空间（如性别或种族），生成视觉上不同但被识别为目标身份的对抗性人脸。

Result: 在AWS的CompareFaces API上，仅需100张人脸图像的单次查询，成功率超过93%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖迁移性或开源替代模型，且能生成具有特定高级属性的对抗性人脸。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Motivation: 动态驾驶场景重建在数字孪生和自动驾驶模拟中很重要，但现有方法在偏离输入轨迹时存在质量下降问题。

Method: 提出LidarPainter，一种一步扩散模型，从稀疏LiDAR条件和损坏渲染中实时恢复一致视图。

Conclusion: LidarPainter不仅提升重建质量，还支持通过文本提示生成多样化风格，扩展了现有资源库。

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

Motivation: ViT的高计算成本限制了实际应用，现有方法独立剪枝Q/K令牌导致性能下降。

Method: 提出基于块的对称剪枝与融合方法（BSPF-ViT），考虑令牌交互，联合优化剪枝和压缩。

Result: 在DeiT-T和DeiT-S上分别提升1.3%和2.0%的准确率，计算开销减少50%，速度提升40%。

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT在提升ViT效率的同时，显著提高了性能，适用于多种ViT模型。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

Motivation: 现有双边网格方法仅支持线性变换，而传统MLP方法难以处理局部变化，因此需要一种结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: 通过生成包含MLP参数的双边网格，动态为每个像素分配独特的变换参数，并提出网格分解策略和多通道引导图优化参数生成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在性能上优于现有技术，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: BPAM框架成功结合了双边网格的空间建模能力和MLP的非线性映射能力，为图像增强提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为启发式或表达能力有限，无法灵活建模6D旋转格式的姿态分布。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，消融实验分析了其影响。

Conclusion: 为人体运动捕捉和重建提供了概率基础，支持旋转框架的兼容性。

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior
over human body poses using normalizing flows. Unlike heuristic or
low-expressivity alternatives, our method leverages RealNVP to learn a flexible
density over poses represented in the 6D rotation format. We address the
challenge of modeling distributions on the manifold of valid 6D rotations by
inverting the Gram-Schmidt process during training, enabling stable learning
while preserving downstream compatibility with rotation-based frameworks. Our
architecture and training pipeline are framework-agnostic and easily
reproducible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned prior through
both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and we analyze its impact via
ablation studies. This work provides a sound probabilistic foundation for
integrating pose priors into human motion capture and reconstruction pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度图像识别方法依赖预训练模型，限制了在资源受限环境中的适应性和任务特定架构的发展。

Method: 引入TGDA框架，结合数据感知增强和弱监督，通过知识蒸馏实现任务特定架构（如LRNets和ViTFS）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TGDA方法性能优于或匹配现有预训练模型，尤其在低分辨率任务中提升显著。

Conclusion: TGDA为细粒度视觉系统提供了一种高效且适应性强的替代方案，减少了对预训练的依赖。

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在脑肿瘤分类中优于现有技术，各组件对精度提升均有贡献。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

Conclusion: 通过小波变换和特征空间解耦，该方法有效解决了低光图像增强中的特征纠缠问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are
publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in

Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic

Conclusion: RODS在不增加额外训练成本的情况下，显著提升了扩散模型的采样鲁棒性和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

Method: 扩展了VQA数据集为DD-VQA+，引入属性驱动的混合LoRA策略、多粒度提示学习和伪造感知训练策略，并设计辅助损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本伪造判断和分析方面优于现有方法，准确率更高。

Conclusion: MGFFD-VLM框架通过多策略整合，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 研究为健美操领域的自动化工具开发提供了初步基础。

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型，利用出生24小时内的胸部X光片预测极低出生体重婴儿的支气管肺发育不良（BPD）结果。模型通过领域特定的预训练和优化技术，实现了较高的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPD是一种常见的慢性肺病，对极低出生体重婴儿影响深远。目前的预防措施存在严重风险，因此需要一种非侵入性的早期预测工具，以减少不必要的干预。

Method: 研究使用163名极低出生体重婴儿的胸部X光片，通过预训练的ResNet-50模型，结合渐进式层冻结、CutMix增强和线性探测技术，优化模型性能。

Result: 最佳模型在预测中重度BPD时，AUROC为0.78，平衡准确率为0.69，F1分数为0.67。领域特定的预训练显著优于ImageNet初始化。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域特定的预训练结合优化技术，能够从常规X光片中准确预测BPD结果，为临床提供可行的预测工具。

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现优异，但存在隐私泄露和偏见传播的风险，需要一种方法移除敏感或有害概念。

Method: FADE结合轨迹感知微调策略和对抗性目标，确保概念被可靠移除的同时保持模型整体保真度。

Result: FADE在概念移除和图像质量上优于现有方法（如ESD、UCE、MACE和ANT），性能提升5-10%。

Conclusion: FADE为安全公平的生成建模设定了新标准，无需从头训练即可移除指定概念。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples

Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注或多视角校准图像，而KeyDiff3D旨在通过单视角图像实现低成本、高效的3D关键点估计。

Method: 利用多视角扩散模型生成多视角图像作为监督信号，并提取其2D多视角特征构建3D特征体积，将隐式3D先验转化为显式3D特征。

Result: 在Human3.6M、Stanford Dogs等数据集上验证了方法的准确性、泛化能力，并展示了单图像生成3D物体的可操作性。

Conclusion: KeyDiff3D通过扩散模型的几何先验，实现了无需标注的单目3D关键点估计，并支持3D物体操作，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通道知识蒸馏（CWD）和掩码生成蒸馏（MGD）方法，用于提升轻量级模型在杂草检测中的性能，实验表明两种方法均能显著提高模型精度，且不影响模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 杂草检测是精准农业的关键，但现有模型在资源受限平台上难以区分视觉相似的杂草种类，因此需要高效的知识蒸馏方法提升轻量级模型的性能。

Method: 使用YOLO11x作为教师模型，YOLO11n作为学生模型，分别应用CWD和MGD方法进行知识蒸馏，并在真实数据集（甜菜作物和四种杂草）上进行实验。

Result: CWD和MGD分别将mAP50提高了2.5%和1.9%，且在嵌入式设备（Jetson Orin Nano和Raspberry Pi 5）上验证了实时部署的可行性。

Conclusion: CWD和MGD是提升深度学习杂草检测模型精度的高效实用方法，适用于精准农业和植物表型分析场景。

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Conclusion: CueCo 通过整合对比学习和聚类，为无监督视觉表示学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new
direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

*Kaiwen Huang,Yi Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yizhe Zhang,Chen Gong,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本驱动的半监督医学图像分割框架（Text-SemiSeg），通过文本增强视觉语义嵌入，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像标注成本高的问题，利用文本信息增强视觉语义理解。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：文本增强多平面表示（TMR）、类别感知语义对齐（CSA）和动态认知增强（DCA）。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证了模型的有效性，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg通过文本与视觉交互显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

Abstract: Realistic human surveillance datasets are crucial for training and evaluating
computer vision models under real-world conditions, facilitating the
development of robust algorithms for human and human-interacting object
detection in complex environments. These datasets need to offer diverse and
challenging data to enable a comprehensive assessment of model performance and
the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

Conclusion: AutoVDC能显著提升自动驾驶大规模数据集的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QuRe的方法，通过硬负样本采样减少假阴性，提升组合图像检索（CIR）的准确性和用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIR方法仅关注目标图像检索，忽视了其他图像的相关性，导致假阴性问题，影响用户满意度。

Method: 提出QuRe方法，通过优化奖励模型目标和硬负样本采样策略，减少假阴性。

Result: QuRe在FashionIQ和CIRR数据集上达到最优性能，并在HP-FashionIQ数据集上与人偏好最一致。

Conclusion: QuRe有效解决了假阴性问题，提升了CIR的性能和用户满意度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数InterpIoU，通过插值框解决现有IoU损失函数的问题，并在动态调整插值系数的Dynamic InterpIoU中进一步优化，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoU损失函数在非重叠情况下不可导，且手工设计的几何惩罚对框的形状、大小和分布敏感，导致小物体检测效果不佳和框扩大问题。

Method: 提出InterpIoU，用插值框与目标的IoU替代手工几何惩罚；进一步提出Dynamic InterpIoU，动态调整插值系数以适应不同物体分布。

Result: 在COCO、VisDrone和PASCAL VOC数据集上，新方法优于现有IoU损失函数，尤其在小物体检测中表现突出。

Conclusion: InterpIoU和Dynamic InterpIoU有效解决了现有损失函数的问题，提升了检测性能，尤其是小物体检测。

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在视频识别中虽表现优异，但计算成本高，难以在设备上高效部署。

Method: DVFL-Net利用知识蒸馏和时空焦点调制技术，从大模型（教师）中提取知识到小模型（学生），并结合前向KL散度优化知识传递。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DVFL-Net在性能和效率之间取得平衡，内存占用低、计算量少且准确率高。

Conclusion: DVFL-Net是实时人类动作识别的实用解决方案，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

Motivation: 针对文本密集图像中的VQA任务，需要细粒度提取文本信息，而DAM的区域级描述能力为此提供了潜在优势。

Method: 提出DAM-QA框架，通过多区域视图聚合答案，优化文本相关证据的识别。

Result: 在六个VQA基准测试中，DAM-QA显著优于基线DAM，尤其在DocVQA上提升7+分，且参数更少。

Conclusion: DAM-QA展示了区域感知模型在文本密集VQA任务中的潜力，并缩小了与通用视觉语言模型的差距。

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Conclusion: SENTINEL通过句子级早期干预有效解决幻觉问题，具有优越性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Conclusion: RadGazeIntent成功建模了放射科医生的意图驱动行为，为医学图像解读提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Conclusion: SpatialTrackerV2通过联合学习几何和运动，实现了高效且高性能的3D点跟踪。

Abstract: We present SpatialTrackerV2, a feed-forward 3D point tracking method for
monocular videos. Going beyond modular pipelines built on off-the-shelf
components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a
high-performing and feedforward 3D point tracker. It decomposes world-space 3D
motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion,
with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed
RGB-D videos, and unlabeled in-the-wild footage. By learning geometry and
motion jointly from such heterogeneous data, SpatialTrackerV2 outperforms
existing 3D tracking methods by 30%, and matches the accuracy of leading
dynamic 3D reconstruction approaches while running 50$\times$ faster.

Abstract: Humans are integral components of the transportation ecosystem, and
understanding their behaviors is crucial to facilitating the development of
safe driving systems. Although recent progress has explored various aspects of
human behavior$\unicode{x2014}$such as motion, trajectories, and
intention$\unicode{x2014}$a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human
behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable. In this work,
we propose $\textbf{MMHU}$, a large-scale benchmark for human behavior analysis
featuring rich annotations, such as human motion and trajectories, text
description for human motions, human intention, and critical behavior labels
relevant to driving safety. Our dataset encompasses 57k human motion clips and
1.73M frames gathered from diverse sources, including established driving
datasets such as Waymo, in-the-wild videos from YouTube, and self-collected
data. A human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline is developed to generate rich
behavior captions. We provide a thorough dataset analysis and benchmark
multiple tasks$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from motion prediction to motion
generation and human behavior question answering$\unicode{x2014}$thereby
offering a broad evaluation suite. Project page :

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像领域缺乏解释基础模型推理的工具，SAEs在视觉领域的成功应用启发其在医学影像中的探索。

Method: 提出CytoSAE，基于40,000多张外周血单细胞图像训练，适用于多样化和域外数据集。

Result: CytoSAE识别形态学相关概念，验证其有效性，并在AML亚型分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CytoSAE为医学影像提供可解释性工具，性能媲美现有方法，且能揭示亚细胞水平信息。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Motivation: 现有的3D生成模型主要关注几何和纹理，忽略了物理基础建模，限制了其在仿真和具身AI等物理领域的应用。

Method: 1）构建PhysXNet数据集，通过人机协作标注物理属性；2）提出PhysXGen框架，利用双分支架构将物理知识注入预训练的3D结构空间。

Conclusion: PhysX为物理基础的3D生成提供了端到端解决方案，未来将开源代码、数据和模型以推动研究。

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Conclusion: AI在连接科学、艺术与环境保护方面潜力巨大，为未来可持续技术生态系统研究指明方向。

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human
dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI)
can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI
interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists
and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological
restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue
that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings
highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and
environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on

Abstract: We introduce a modular harness design for LLM agents that composes of

backbone to tackle a wide spectrum of multi turn gaming environments without
domain-specific engineering. Using classic and modern game suites as
low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为自接地验证（SGV）的轻量级方法，以解决多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）作为验证器时的协议偏见问题，显著提升了任务完成率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏明确成功标准的领域（如计算机使用），如何将人类直觉转化为可扩展的规则是一个挑战。MLLMs因其世界知识、人类偏好对齐和推理能力被视为潜在解决方案，但其作为验证器时存在协议偏见问题。

Method: 提出自接地验证（SGV），通过无条件生成和条件生成两步，利用MLLMs自身的采样机制，先获取任务完成的广泛先验，再基于这些先验评估候选轨迹。

Result: SGV显著提升了MLLMs作为验证器的性能，准确率和失败检测率提高了20个百分点，并在多个任务中实现了实时监督，任务完成率提升了48%。

Conclusion: SGV是一种有效的轻量级方法，能够克服MLLMs的协议偏见，显著提升其在复杂任务中的验证能力。

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态规划建模依赖专家知识，而现有LLM方法难以直接应用于DP问题，因此需要开发专门的方法和基准。

Method: 提出了DPLM模型和DualReflect数据生成管道，结合前向和后向生成方法以扩展训练数据。

Result: DPLM在DP问题上表现优于现有LLM模型，尤其是在复杂问题上。

Conclusion: 前向和后向生成方法的结合在数据扩展中具有互补优势，是提升DP问题自动化建模的关键。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Result: 代理主要关注光流的不连续区域和大光流区域，行为类似昆虫，且策略在不同代理中一致。

Conclusion: 该策略可能适用于开发简单明确的无人机控制法则。

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）在联合状态-动作空间指数增长的情况下，探索-利用权衡问题尤为突出。本文旨在解决这一挑战，特别是在混合交通中CAVs的协同决策优化。

Method: 1. 构建动态交通流的游戏拓扑张量，压缩高维状态信息；2. 基于QMIX算法，结合访问计数和智能体互信息，建立拓扑增强的MARL框架。

Result: 在不同交通密度和CAV渗透率下，TPE-MARL在交通效率、安全性、决策平滑性和任务完成度上表现优异，且决策理性与人类驾驶员相当或更优。

Conclusion: TPE-MARL通过拓扑增强和探索-利用平衡优化，显著提升了CAVs在混合交通中的协同决策性能，为MARL在复杂动态环境中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance

*Yuhao Chen,Shuochen Liu,Yuanjie Lyu,Chao Zhang,Jiayao Shi,Tong Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在空间战略推理（如中国象棋）中的表现不足，并提出了一种多阶段训练框架Xiangqi-R1，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国象棋因其复杂规则和空间特性成为测试LLMs战略推理能力的理想平台，填补了LLMs在空间战略推理领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出三阶段训练框架：1）微调以预测合法走法；2）引入战略注释优化决策；3）通过GRPO强化学习提升推理稳定性。

Result: Xiangqi-R1在合法走法和分析准确性上分别提升18%和22%，显著优于通用LLMs。

Conclusion: 研究为在空间复杂领域构建通用战略智能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in
spatially complex areas.

### [149] [Recurrent U-Net-Based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN) for Accurate Deformation Predictions in Sheet Material Forming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11547)
*Yingxue Zhao,Qianyi Chen,Haoran Li,Haosu Zhou,Hamid Reza Attar,Tobias Pfaff,Tailin Wu,Nan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RUGNN的图神经网络替代模型，用于预测材料成形过程中的变形场，解决了传统AI模型在捕捉3D空间关系和排列不变性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标量或图像的AI替代模型难以捕捉复杂的3D空间关系和排列不变性，因此需要开发更先进的图神经网络模型。

Method: 开发了RUGNN模型，结合门控循环单元（GRU）建模时间动态，并采用U-Net启发的图上下采样机制处理空间长程依赖。提出了一种新的‘节点到表面’接触表示方法。

Result: 在冷成形和热成形案例中验证了RUGNN的准确性，其预测结果与有限元模拟接近，且优于其他基线GNN架构。

Conclusion: RUGNN是一种可靠的方法，能够支持板材成形设计，提供准确的制造性预测。

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have
been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material
forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically
built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability
to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a
permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based
surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study
developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U
Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate
predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming
timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model
temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample
mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'
contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements
in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN
model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot
forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN
model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth
FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model
tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training
strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that
RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by
enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高脊柱手术住院时长预测的准确性和可解释性，以支持临床决策。

Method: 比较传统ML模型与SurgeryLSTM（带注意力的双向LSTM），使用电子健康记录数据评估性能。

Result: SurgeryLSTM预测准确率最高（R2=0.86），注意力机制提升了可解释性，识别出关键预测因素。

Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM为脊柱手术住院时长预测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for
predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the
benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and
Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random
forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,
SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical
adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based
temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM
presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in
elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,
explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance
discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

Motivation: 解决深度学习在实时虚拟传感中因稀疏、噪声或非共位传感器数据导致的不确定性量化难题，特别是在高风险领域。

Method: 提出Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO)，将蒙特卡洛dropout与分形预测结合于DeepONet架构中，实现空间分辨的不确定性估计。

Result: 在湍流、弹塑性变形和全球宇宙辐射剂量估计三个应用中，CMCO实现了接近名义的覆盖范围，即使在强空间梯度和代理传感环境下。

Conclusion: CMCO为神经算子提供了一种通用、即插即用的不确定性量化解决方案，为科学机器学习奠定了可扩展、泛化性强且不确定性感知的新基础。

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to
compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity
simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the
\emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein
Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic
differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed
distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural
Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime
geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics
emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential,
including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage
efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges
across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open
source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive
approaches to numerical relativity. Code is made available at

Abstract: As privacy regulations become more stringent and access to real-world data
becomes increasingly constrained, synthetic data generation has emerged as a
vital solution, especially for tabular datasets, which are central to domains
like finance, healthcare and the social sciences. This survey presents a
comprehensive and focused review of recent advances in synthetic tabular data
generation, emphasizing methods that preserve complex feature relationships,

and evaluation strategies. Therefore, this review prioritizes the actionable
goals that drive synthetic data creation, including conditional generation and
risk-sensitive modeling. Additionally, the survey proposes a benchmark
framework to align technical innovation with real-world demands. By bridging
theoretical foundations with practical deployment, this work serves as both a
roadmap for future research and a guide for implementing synthetic tabular data

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial
practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep
generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work
addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models
(Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal
Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and
Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our
evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation
of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation
(reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii)
dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific
dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle
conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware
reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring
additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically
calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence,
component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall
performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal
variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,
and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM
generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在训练过程中“顿悟”现象（即测试准确率延迟提升）的预测方法和内在机制。

Method: 通过Dropout鲁棒性曲线（DRC）、神经元稀疏性、嵌入相似性等指标分析模型的泛化行为。

Result: 发现测试准确率在“顿悟”期间出现局部最大值，神经元活跃度增加，嵌入分布趋于双峰且与数据集对称性相关。

Conclusion: 这些指标不仅预测“顿悟”行为，还揭示了其起源和动态特征。

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

Conclusion: 提出的协议在保护隐私的同时实现了可验证的联邦学习评估。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak
sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to
enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of
revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that
their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented
without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated
learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both
the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a
threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
(for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate
the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and
verifiability.

Conclusion: STAGED为数据驱动的复杂细胞动态建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our
understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under
normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as
clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as
independent data points of population distributions. With spatial
transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic
cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key
computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such
complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)
provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules
derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究为深度模型中几何基元如何组合成高级功能提供了代数视角，展示了参数效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of
low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but
these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this
compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize
linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using
Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions
of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a
differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This
construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense
matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention
layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such
as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an
algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into
higher-level functions within deep models.

Conclusion: 核心集选择方法需谨慎使用，以避免加剧偏见，且需进一步研究以确保模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Conclusion: 论文为偏好型MDPs提供了理论分析和高效算法，扩展了对抗性MDPs的研究范围。

Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs
(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the
numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead
observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices
being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the
reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a
regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we
present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for
episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per
episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is
the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret
lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda
scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that
achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global
optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all
occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from
suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and
computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization
algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the
unknown-transition setting.

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

TL;DR: 本文探讨了电力传输网络中负荷预测的全局模型（GFMs）相较于传统局部模型（LFMs）的优势，特别是在处理数据漂移、可扩展性和泛化性方面。通过实验验证，全局目标转换模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统局部预测模型在泛化性、数据漂移和可扩展性方面存在局限，而全局模型通过跨学习提供了改进的可能。本文旨在研究全局模型在数据漂移下的表现及其对不同建模技术的影响。

Method: 研究了特征转换和目标转换模型，提出了基于时间序列聚类（TSC）的方法，包括模型基TSC和加权实例基TSC，以处理数据异质性和平衡全局与局部动态。

Result: 实验表明，全局目标转换模型在全局特征和聚类技术的支持下表现优于局部模型，而全局特征转换模型需依赖TSC来有效管理数据异质性。

Conclusion: 全局目标转换模型在负荷预测中具有显著优势，尤其是在处理数据异质性和漂移时。未来的研究可进一步优化全局与局部的平衡。

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN依赖随机或简单初始特征，导致收敛慢和性能不佳。

Result: 在节点聚类任务中，GG在所有真实数据集上表现最佳；GG-C在节点分类任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构感知的特征初始化对发挥GNN潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide
range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often
constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature
representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions.
In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph
encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that
enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework
as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and
supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world
datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For
node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which
concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines.
These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature
initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化SINDy模型的不确定性对于评估其可靠性至关重要，尤其是在安全关键应用中。

Method: 通过集成Conformal Prediction框架，提出三种应用：时间序列预测的不确定性量化、基于特征重要性的模型选择以及模型系数的不确定性量化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在时间序列预测中能可靠实现目标覆盖，有效量化特征重要性，并在非高斯噪声下提供更稳健的系数不确定性区间。

Conclusion: Conformal Prediction与E-SINDy的结合能显著提升模型的不确定性量化能力，适用于复杂非线性系统。

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for
discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying
uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability,
particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty
quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble
approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a
framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees
based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three
applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1)
quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on
library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified
model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three
applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical
systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can
reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting,
effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty
intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to
standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Graph-in-Graph（GiG）的新框架，结合转导学习和归纳学习，通过将药物和靶点分子结构图表示为药物-靶点相互作用图中的元节点，显著提升了药物-靶点相互作用（DTI）预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络（GNN）的DTI预测方法难以有效整合药物、靶点及其相互作用的多样化特征。

Method: 引入GiG框架，将药物和靶点分子结构图作为元节点嵌入药物-靶点相互作用图中，结合分子水平和网络水平的特征。

Result: GiG模型在多个评估指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合不同学习范式和相互作用数据能显著提升DTI预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug
discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule
to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a
promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of
conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce
Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample
conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,
using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular
graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples
rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is
able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann
distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for
zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD
simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for
scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot
generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local
structure into the GFlowNet model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比激活加法（CAA）在不同规模的Llama 2模型（7B、13B、70B）中的有效性，发现CAA在早期到中期层最有效，但随着模型规模增大效果减弱，且负向引导比正向引导效果更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的复杂性和能力提升，较少广泛部署的对齐技术的效果尚不明确。本文旨在探索CAA在不同模型规模下的有效性。

Method: 通过对比激活加法（CAA）在Llama 2模型家族（7B、13B、70B）中的应用，研究其在残差流向量空间中的方向引导效果。

Result: 1) CAA在早期到中期层最有效；2) 随着模型规模增大，CAA效果减弱；3) 负向引导比正向引导效果更显著。

Conclusion: CAA的效果受模型规模和引导方向影响，未来研究需进一步优化对齐技术以适应更大规模的模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the
efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building
on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition
(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the
family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable
'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive
pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual
stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and
aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.
Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found
that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The
effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more
pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰铁路网络是全球最繁忙的网络之一，延误问题突出，现有研究多关注短期预测，忽略了网络范围的模式。

Method: 采用XGBoost分类器，结合节点中心性度量，并比较多种分类器（如随机森林、决策树等），改进现有方法。

Result: 结果表现有限，尤其在非同步测试场景中，表明需要更多针对性改进。

Conclusion: 研究为交通网络评估提供了新视角，并提出了未来开发更稳健预测模型的方向。

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

Motivation: 现有方法在单细胞RNA测序中通常假设线性转移和欧几里得几何，但线性插值可能不匹配数据流形上的测地线路径，限制了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlatVI提升了与下游欧几里得几何假设方法的兼容性，为单细胞数据建模提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声标签的基准数据集上，CLID-MU优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CLID-MU为噪声标签场景下的元学习提供了有效解决方案，无需依赖干净标签数据集。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

Abstract: Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major
challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have
demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D
molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based
conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable
Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph
diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen
samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical
reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a
dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M
conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional
small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers
competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand
generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a
foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular
generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure
conditioning.

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Result: 在5个数据集中4个表现最佳，大规模Flight数据集上MRR提升6.95%，训练时间仅需10.17%。

Conclusion: HyperEvent在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，尤其适用于大规模图数据。

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental
task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and
event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states,
failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of
causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework
reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to
HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event
correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the
query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the
structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the
occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a
valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard.
For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm
that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments
validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs.
Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank
over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while
utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

Result: Protenix-Mini在基准数据集上性能仅下降1-5%，显著降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: Protenix-Mini适合计算资源有限但对准确性要求高的应用场景。

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual
multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by
incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of
reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely
applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces
significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical
efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either
incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising
statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we
propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret
bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of
our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD)
estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion
of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator,
even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to
maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient
optimistic method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征归因方法假设特征顺序固定，无法区分特征值和位置对预测的影响。

Method: 提出OrdShap方法，通过排列特征位置量化其对预测的影响，并与Sanchez-Bergantiños值建立理论联系。

Result: 在健康、自然语言和合成数据集上的实验表明，OrdShap能有效捕捉特征值和位置的贡献。

Conclusion: OrdShap为理解模型行为提供了更深入的视角，解决了特征归因中的位置混淆问题。

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential
dependencies, but their complexity necessitates post-hoc feature attribution
methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify
feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating
the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input
sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution
method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions
change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic
connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a
theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical
results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight
OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position
attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective
solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple
ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous
passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service
delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform,
encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has
the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching
efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to
dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective
of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business
model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through
trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable
early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges,
this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers'
acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high
stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party
integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a
policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The
proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance
during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term
memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and
adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning
efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces
early-stage training losses.

Conclusion: Meta-IR通过元学习有效解决了不平衡回归问题，展示了预处理与学习模型间的内在关系。

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are
extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present
challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A
common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to
address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods
and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many
combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric
affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced
Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by
training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the
resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The
meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map
the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two
formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers
to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.
Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier
is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The
Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between
the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with
AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with
baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no
resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of
them. The code, data, and further information of the experiments can be found

Abstract: Imbalanced problems can arise in different real-world situations, and to
address this, certain strategies in the form of resampling or balancing
algorithms are proposed. This issue has largely been studied in the context of
classification, and yet, the same problem features in regression tasks, where
target values are continuous. This work presents an extensive experimental
study comprising various balancing and predictive models, and wich uses metrics
to capture important elements for the user and to evaluate the predictive model
in an imbalanced regression data context. It also proposes a taxonomy for
imbalanced regression approaches based on three crucial criteria: regression
model, learning process, and evaluation metrics. The study offers new insights
into the use of such strategies, highlighting the advantages they bring to each
model's learning process, and indicating directions for further studies. The

Motivation: 由于实证科学和机器学习中复制性失败的问题，研究者开始关注复制性学习算法的设计。在强化学习中，环境探索的复杂性导致样本效率低下，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种复制性RL算法，在低水平表格MDP中实现了样本复杂度为$	ilde{O}(S^2A)$，并通过下界分析验证了其近最优性。

Result: 算法在生成模型和非生成模型（episodic）设置下均表现出色，样本复杂度接近理论下界。

Conclusion: 研究表明，环境探索并非复制性学习的显著障碍，样本高效的复制性RL是可行的。

Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine
learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning
algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from
a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the
design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.
In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control
settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with
a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative
model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch
setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only
$\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a
generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the
substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key
question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration
inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable
RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular
MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our
main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging
the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a
matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under
the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in
the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of
our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

Conclusion: 该框架通过自动化GUI工作流程显著减少仿真时间，支持快速设计迭代，同时满足生产级RF电路的精度要求。

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for
RF power amplifier design that reduces simulation requirements by 65% while
maintaining $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm accuracy. The proposed method combines
MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to
intelligently explore multidimensional parameter spaces. Instead of
exhaustively simulating all parameter combinations to achieve target P2dB
compression specifications, our approach strategically selects approximately
35% of critical simulation points. The framework processes ADS netlists,
executes harmonic balance simulations on the reduced dataset, and trains a
CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space.
Validation across 15 PA operating modes yields an average $R^2$ of 0.901, with
the system ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target
specifications. The integrated solution delivers 58.24% to 77.78% reduction in
simulation time through automated GUI-based workflows, enabling rapid design
iterations without compromising accuracy standards required for production RF
circuits.

Result: Kevin在正确性（56%到82%）和性能（0.53x到1.10x）上显著优于基准模型，并超越前沿模型。

Conclusion: 多轮RL在CUDA内核优化中有效，串行细化比并行采样更具优势。

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Conclusion: MLED通过多级LLM增强，有效结合文本与图结构，显著提升欺诈检测能力。

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Social interactions play a crucial role in shaping human behavior,
relationships, and societies. It encompasses various forms of communication,
such as verbal conversation, non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and body
language. In this work, we develop a novel computational approach to detect a
foundational aspect of human social interactions, in-person verbal
conversations, by leveraging audio and inertial data captured with a commodity
smartwatch in acoustically-challenging scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we
conducted a lab study with 11 participants and a semi-naturalistic study with
24 participants. We analyzed machine learning and deep learning models with 3
different fusion methods, showing the advantages of fusing audio and inertial
data to consider not only verbal cues but also non-verbal gestures in
conversations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive set of evaluations
across activities and sampling rates to demonstrate the benefits of multimodal
sensing in specific contexts. Overall, our framework achieved 82.0$\pm$3.0%
macro F1-score when detecting conversations in the lab and 77.2$\pm$1.8% in the

Result: 实验表明，DUSE在类别平衡和不平衡设置下均优于8种核心集选择基线方法，且对未见模型具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DUSE为解决AMR领域数据稀缺问题提供了一种有效方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Result: 实证分析表明，对于五点反馈，复杂方法仅需正则化平均一半的个体即可达到相同性能。

Conclusion: 结论指出反馈粒度越高，复杂方法的优势越明显，为高粒度反馈场景提供了优化方向。

Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training
AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with
granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater
informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's
distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,
cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to
approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the
empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As
we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using
feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback
granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of
regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more
sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this
pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the
number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By
contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance
of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring
knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical
performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior
remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a
series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the
memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization.
Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited
exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than
exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds
yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization
gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and
broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL
settings.

Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land
use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and
analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation
optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models
borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and
often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land
use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility
distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future
projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study
introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination
mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages
adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it
utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend
historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid
mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions
of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior
modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its

### [192] [Emergence of Quantised Representations Isolated to Anisotropic Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12070)
*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Spotlight Resonance的新方法，用于确定表征对齐，发现网络原语的代数对称性是任务无关表征结构的强预测因子。通过改变激活函数的研究，揭示了离散表征的形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示功能形式选择对表征结构的影响，特别是当代形式如何导致连续结构的离散化（量化效应），并探讨其对下游可解释性现象的影响。

Method: 采用改进的Spotlight Resonance方法，通过改变激活函数（离散与连续代数对称性）进行消融研究，分析表征的形成与排列。

Result: 发现离散代数置换对称性激活函数导致表征离散化，而连续代数正交对称性激活函数保持连续性。量化表征与重建误差增加相关。

Conclusion: 功能形式选择会引入意外的归纳偏差，导致表征中的任务无关结构。这一发现为离散表征的形成机制提供了因果模型，并对可解释性研究具有启示意义。

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational
alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this,
it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong
predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this
new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and
arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the
activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise
when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic
permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a
continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings
corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended
inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in
representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of
otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this
supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations
may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability
phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general
linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed
mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide
several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary
results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with
a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures
that this collapse can be detrimental.

TL;DR: 论文提出了‘信息差距’概念，用于比较两个预测模型在下游决策任务中的‘有用性’，并给出了其双重表征和自然信息度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决决策者在多个可能校准错误的预测模型中选择更‘有用’模型的问题。

Method: 引入信息差距概念，定义其双重表征，并提出一种类似EMD的度量方法。

Result: 信息差距度量满足完整性、可靠性和样本高效性，适用于完美校准预测器。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了现有概念，并为模型选择提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive
models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more
"useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution
introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,
defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over
the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes
several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration
Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its
calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,
Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our
second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,
which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a
relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction
distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is
complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the
prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel
combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly
calibrated predictors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的半监督频谱感知方法，解决了标签数据稀缺和安全漏洞问题，并通过实验验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线设备的快速增长导致频谱稀缺，动态频谱分配（DSA）成为关键解决方案，但传统机器学习方法因隐私和带宽限制难以应用。

Method: 采用半监督联邦学习结合能量检测，训练模型于未标记数据集，并提出新型防御机制应对数据投毒攻击。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在未标记数据集上接近完美准确率，并能抵御高比例恶意参与者的攻击。

Conclusion: 联邦学习频谱感知（FLSS）是一种高效且安全的解决方案，适用于实际频谱感知场景。

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and
the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,
this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical
challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and
dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address
this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for
improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems
is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory
challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such
as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses
two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of
labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is
tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,
enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security
vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our
analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in
countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel
defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data
poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,
demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets
and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data
poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are
malicious.

Abstract: Device recognition is vital for security in wireless communication systems,
particularly for applications like access control. Radio Frequency Fingerprint
Identification (RFFI) offers a non-cryptographic solution by exploiting
hardware-induced signal distortions. This paper proposes HyDRA, a Hybrid
Dual-mode RF Architecture that integrates an optimized Variational Mode

the Mamba Linear Flow Encoder (MLFE) for linear-complexity processing, adapting
to varying conditions. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in closed-set scenarios and robust performance
in our proposed open-set classification method, effectively identifying
unauthorized devices. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, HyDRA achieves
millisecond-level inference speed with low power consumption, providing a
practical solution for real-time wireless authentication in real-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽广泛用于大模型微调，但仍面临初始化策略优化和低秩矩阵分解过参数化的挑战。

Method: 将固定秩LoRA矩阵视为光滑流形，通过流形上的最快损失下降方向确定初始化，并消除过参数化。

Result: 实验表明，RiemannLoRA在收敛速度和最终性能上均优于标准LoRA及其先进变体。

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA为LoRA提供了一种高效、稳定的优化框架，显著提升了大模型微调的效果。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Motivation: 改进全球天气建模，解决传统方法在计算效率和概率校准上的不足，同时保持光谱真实性和动态稳定性。

Method: 采用纯卷积神经网络架构，结合模型和数据并行训练范式，支持大规模GPU训练，实现快速推理。

Conclusion: FourCastNet 3在计算效率、概率技能和光谱保真度方面表现优异，有望改进气象预报和早期预警系统。

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,
geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting.
The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8
to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches,
FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting
and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

Motivation: 基础模型在边缘部署面临通信和计算挑战，需要高效策略。

Method: 利用Segment Means表示近似中间特征，重构自注意力机制以减少冗余计算，并设计分区感知的因果掩码。

Result: 在ViT、BERT和GPT-2上测试，通信开销减少高达99.2%，计算减少51.24%，精度损失小。

Conclusion: PRISM为资源受限的边缘环境提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial
assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling
techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on
simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently
compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly
address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component
Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian
Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design
choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer
representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically,
our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula
dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships,
demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly
enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results
indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications

Result: RadioDiff-3D在UrbanRadio3D上验证了其在高维无线电地图构建中的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为3D环境感知通信提供了基础数据集和基准，推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling
environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial
distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM
construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely
on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as
direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial
variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static
learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data
distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a
large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in
realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than
previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,
forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than
prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet
with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce
RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D
convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware
scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based
on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate
that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,
high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work
provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D
environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 通过代表性和IEMM算法，成功为证据聚类提供了可解释且谨慎的解释方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem.
Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and
imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential
clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This
paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering
results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our
analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers.
Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to
accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable
the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of
evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers
tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative
Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable
and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We
validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into
account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an
explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

Motivation: 完全量化的模型可能在精度上表现不佳，且难以在低端硬件上部署，因此需要选择性量化来解决这些问题。

Method: TuneQn通过选择性量化ONNX模型，部署到不同硬件上，测量性能指标（如精度和模型大小），并使用Pareto Front优化选择最佳模型候选。

Result: 实验表明，TuneQn能减少高达54.14%的精度损失和72.9%的模型大小。

Conclusion: TuneQn有效实现了选择性量化和优化，为模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the
original model.

Result: LEOPARD在经典NLP基准测试中实现了离散属性的非线性擦除，并在深度非线性分类器中有效减少了偏见。

Conclusion: LEOPARD方法在移除敏感信息和促进公平性方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

Conclusion: PILM为线性PDEs问题提供了可解析求解的框架，尤其在数学正则化下表现优异，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

Motivation: 早期对DNN可行性的怀疑源于其非线性特性导致无法保证收敛到全局最优解，但实践证明标准训练协议下的大规模DNN表现良好。然而，社区过于关注优化效率，忽视了优化器对学习解性质的影响。

Method: 通过分析现有优化器的行为，提出优化器不仅影响收敛速度，还能通过引入归纳偏置改变模型的有效表达能力。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区更深入地理解现有优化器的偏置，并设计新的优化器以明确影响学习解的性质，从而补充架构和数据在模型性能中的作用。

Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not
guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using
optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a
primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early
days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed
this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows
that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit
well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This
success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model
for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of
required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We
argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another
perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the
optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative
properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will
encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class
of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of
encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community
should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as
aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain
properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their
convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our
understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we
converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a
critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping
model outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索随机时间序列中的因果关系具有广泛的应用价值，但现有方法对噪声敏感，容易导致误导性推断。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，验证了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为噪声环境下的因果发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet
crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics,
neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD)
have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise,
resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this
paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series
follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing
behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the
extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures,
demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于非平稳核的高斯过程回归框架，通过神经网络动态调整核参数，提升了模型的灵活性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程使用平稳核限制了模型的表达能力，难以适应复杂数据集。

Method: 将非平稳核参数建模为神经网络的输出，联合训练神经网络和高斯过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于平稳模型和变分推断的层次模型，且能有效恢复非平稳参数。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活、易于扩展，适用于不同非平稳核，且无需重新设计优化过程。

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

*Yuan-Chen Shu,Zhiwei Lin,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegCL是一个新型的非重放持续学习框架，通过模型合并实现多领域知识的高效整合，解决了Segment Anything Model (SAM)在特定领域性能受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为特定领域设计，跨领域使用时性能下降，限制了模型的扩展性。

Method: RegCL通过合并不同领域的SAM适配模块参数，利用权重优化指导合并过程，最小化预测差异。

Result: 实验证明RegCL在多领域数据集上表现优异，验证了其在动态场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: RegCL在保持参数效率的同时，成功整合了多领域知识，为持续学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Motivation: 在线持续学习中数据隐私约束和参数增长问题限制了现有方法的实用性。

Result: 在多个数据集上性能显著优于现有方法，参数较少且训练/推理时间适中。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率上均表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（如Deepseek-R1）在推理能力上表现优异，但其在Chain-of-Thought生成过程中易受安全威胁（如后门提示攻击），导致推理机制被破坏。

Method: 提出Thought Purity (TP)防御范式，包括三个部分：(1) 安全优化的数据处理流程，(2) 强化学习增强的规则约束，(3) 自适应监控指标。

Result: TP机制首次全面防御了CoTA漏洞，显著提升了安全性与功能性的平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为下一代AI架构的安全性与功能性平衡提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拓扑神经网络虽然强大，但高阶消息传递计算成本高，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入组合复形上的拉普拉斯算子，计算热核作为节点描述符，支持多尺度信息和置换等变表示。

Result: 理论证明方法具有最大表达能力，实验显示计算效率显著优于现有拓扑方法，并在分子数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为拓扑深度学习提供了高效且表达能力强的表示，为分子分类和性质预测开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph
neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing,
which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a
novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on
combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels
that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information
and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration
into modern transformer-based architectures.
  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can
distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly
outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency.
Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in
distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on
topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning
by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up
exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

*Mohit Prashant,Arvind Easwaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究在无限时间马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中，提出了比现有文献更精确的强化学习（RL）样本复杂度PAC边界。通过近似原始MDP，样本复杂度降低至O(SA log A)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于两点：1）状态间的距离越远，学习第二个状态的ε最优值时第一个状态的价值相关性越低；2）学习一个状态的ε最优值所需的样本复杂度与学习足够远的状态无关。

Method: 通过使用原始状态空间的子集构建较小的MDP来近似原始MDP，从而降低样本复杂度。此外，将结果扩展到无限时间、无模型设置，并构建了一个PAC-MDP算法。

Result: 样本复杂度降低至O(SA log A)时间步长，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提算法在样本复杂度上显著优于现有工作。

Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the
asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The
premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each
other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when
learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of
'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal
value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the
$\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of
transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity
have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number
of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs
constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce
the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps,
where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend
these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a
PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with
showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against
prior work in an experimental setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于$MoS_2$闪存模拟CAM的软树模型硬件-软件协同设计方法，显著提升了树模型的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统树模型在硬件实现中因设备变异和对抗攻击导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用$MoS_2$闪存模拟CAM实现软边界决策，结合软树模型进行高效推理。

Result: 在WDBC数据库上达到96%准确率，MNIST数据集上设备变异影响仅为0.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升AI可信度和效率的专用硬件设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns
regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and
robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in
interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains
computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.
Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable
memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement
sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which
leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$
Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient
inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference
experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional
robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays
achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,
while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model
validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device
threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision
trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's
trustworthiness and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了测试时扩展（test-time scaling）中验证器不完美对性能的影响，通过理论分析验证了ROC曲线的几何特性如何决定方法（如Best-of-N和拒绝采样）的实例级准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对验证器不完美如何影响测试时扩展性能的理论理解，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析验证器ROC曲线的几何特性对Best-of-N和拒绝采样方法性能的影响，并在GSM8K数据集上使用不同版本的Llama和Qwen进行实验验证。

Result: 拒绝采样在固定计算量下优于Best-of-N，但在无限计算量下两者性能趋于一致，取决于ROC曲线在原点附近的斜率。

Conclusion: 验证器ROC曲线的几何特性决定了测试时扩展方法的性能，拒绝采样和Best-of-N在不同计算量下表现不同，但最终收敛于相同精度。

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging
additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied
techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a
verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding
of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this
gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is
precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.
Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC
curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve
for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to
extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute
regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed
compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level
of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different
versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.

TL;DR: NOCTA是一种非贪婪的目标成本权衡获取方法，用于在资源受限的预测任务中动态选择最具信息量的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗等关键应用中，资源限制使得需要权衡特征获取的成本与信息量，同时考虑时间动态性。

Method: 提出了NOCTA-NP（基于最近邻的非参数方法）和NOCTA-P（直接预测获取效用的参数方法）。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据上，NOCTA方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: NOCTA能有效解决动态特征获取问题，适用于资源受限的预测任务。

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts
(MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing
computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our
approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the
computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by
iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These
results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the
design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TDA的新框架，将TMLE直接嵌入神经网络参数空间，用于因果推断，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络在预测方面强大，但在因果参数推断（如治疗效果或生存曲线）上缺乏有效性。现有方法存在计算成本高或无法保证解决高效影响函数方程的问题。

Method: TDA通过划分模型参数并迭代更新目标子集，利用目标梯度消除一阶偏差，生成渐近有效的置信区间。

Result: 在IHDP数据集和模拟生存数据上，TDA减少了偏差并提高了覆盖率，优于标准神经网络估计器和现有后处理方法。

Conclusion: TDA为复杂多参数目标的深度架构提供了一条直接、可扩展的严格因果推断路径。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack
valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire
survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,
existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not
guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally
expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose
Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly
into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone
architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but
a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting
gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the
gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in
estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid
confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal
estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting
gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits
classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric
efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment
effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces
bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators
and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable
pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for
complex multi-parameter targets.

Motivation: 联邦学习的开放参与特性使其容易受到数据投毒攻击，现有防御方法多为被动且计算成本高，假设诚实多数。

Method: 设计了一种贝叶斯博弈机制，服务器使用小型验证数据集验证更新质量并发放奖励，满足个体理性（IR）和激励相容性（IC）。

Conclusion: 该机制计算轻量、预算可控，可集成到现有联邦学习框架中，为经济稳健和可持续的联邦学习生态系统提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its
open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which
malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.
Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules
that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest
majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight
Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically
irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete
information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private
validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design
satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their
participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning
an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions
of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping
adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3
percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.
This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which
collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light,
budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a
practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications
of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box
functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive
stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack
guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation
costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that
adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is
grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition
functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected
improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected
cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these
two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks,
including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we
show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function
consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule
pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs
between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

Conclusion: 结合枚举技术和SharpASP-SR的混合计数方法，在析取程序的全谱上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has
emerged as an important computational problem with applications in
probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This
has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While
substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development
of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of
disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected
propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative
characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring
that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows
SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.
Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate
that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with
large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid
counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive
programs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督式EEG编码器依赖昂贵标注且鲁棒性不足，促使转向自监督EEG基础模型（EEG-FMs），但其实际应用价值和研究进展尚不明确。

Method: 综述10种早期EEG-FMs，分析其基于序列建模（如Transformer）和掩码序列重建的自监督方法。

Result: 模型评估方法不统一且局限，难以评估其实用性；未来需标准化评估、扩大规模效应及优化学习流程。

Conclusion: 未来EEG-FMs需与领域专家合作，开发基准、工具和方法，以提升其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Wi-Fi CSI的多普勒速度投影重建3D潜在运动表示的方法，通过构建统一的多普勒辐射场（DoRF）提升人类活动识别（HAR）的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Wi-Fi CSI在多普勒速度投影方面取得了进展，但实际部署中的泛化能力仍不足。受NeRF启发，作者希望通过3D潜在运动表示提升HAR的鲁棒性。

Method: 从Wi-Fi CSI提取一维多普勒速度投影，重建3D潜在运动表示，并构建统一的多普勒辐射场（DoRF）。

Result: 该方法显著提升了Wi-Fi HAR的泛化准确性。

Conclusion: DoRF在实用传感应用中具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

Motivation: 传统方法计算成本高，神经网络方法能直接映射输入参数到概率密度函数，提高效率。

Method: 使用神经网络直接映射输入参数到概率密度函数，无需数值求解方程。

Result: 在合成数据上验证了计算效率和预测可靠性，精度优于传统有限差分方法。

Conclusion: 为数据驱动的碎裂反分析奠定了基础，并展示了扩展框架的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an
integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The
proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability
density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby
significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient
evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining
accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference
schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's
computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a
foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests
the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model
structures.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型在上下文学习中的能力，揭示了其违反贝叶斯更新的基本性质，并提出了理论分析和实证验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在上下文学习中的行为，特别是其与贝叶斯推断理论的不一致性，以改进不确定性量化和计算效率。

Method: 通过理论分析建立了四个关键结果，包括位置编码的影响、信息论最优性、隐式后验表示收敛性以及最优思维链长度。

Result: 实证验证表明，GPT-3在20个示例内达到理论熵限的99%，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 框架提供了从位置感知架构中提取校准不确定性估计的方法，并优化了部署中的计算效率。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning
capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this
phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent
empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers
systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of
Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the
theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical
applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional
encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2)
transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk
$O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior
representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of
sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as
$k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing
a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.
Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers
reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework
provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from
position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in
deployment.

TL;DR: 论文研究了A/B实验中推荐算法性能比较的偏差问题，重点关注数据共享导致的“共生偏差”，并探讨了GTE符号对算法选择的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准差异均值估计器在估计全局处理效应（GTE）时存在偏差，因实验单元间的干扰（数据共享导致“共生偏差”）。研究动机在于GTE符号对算法选择的重要性。

Method: 采用多臂老虎机框架，理论分析了数据共享下GTE估计符号与真实GTE符号的关系，探索与利用的平衡是关键因素。

Result: 分析表明，探索与利用的水平决定了共生偏差如何影响算法选择。

Conclusion: 研究强调了GTE符号在算法选择中的关键作用，并揭示了数据共享对偏差的影响机制。

Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two
recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard
difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment
effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental
units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms
contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms,
resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this
type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight
that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than
its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this
insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize
when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or
contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of
exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias
impacts algorithm selection.

Motivation: 随着AI模型复杂度的增加，需要更可靠的工具来解释和优化模型决策，传统影响函数在高维场景下表现不佳。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析评估影响函数在高维环境中的表现，并提出新方法Newfluence。

Result: 影响函数在高维场景下不可靠，Newfluence在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Newfluence为解释复杂AI模型提供了更准确的工具，其高维框架还可用于分析其他流行技术。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help
scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions
and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have
emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on
low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller
than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often
operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these
assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in
high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that
influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then
introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains
similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved
accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing
methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues.
Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be
applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

TL;DR: Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA) 和 FairKernelAA 是改进的 AA 方法，通过减少敏感属性在投影中的影响，实现公平性和实用性平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 AA 方法可能无意中编码敏感属性，引发公平性问题，因此需要改进。

Method: FairAA 和 FairKernelAA 通过引入公平性正则化项，减少敏感信息的影响，同时保持原型结构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，FairAA 能有效降低组间可分性，同时保持解释方差。

Conclusion: FairAA 在公平性和实用性之间取得良好平衡，适用于敏感应用中的表示学习。

Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents
data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA
provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can
inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In
this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation
that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the
learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that
addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach
incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and
interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on
synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios,
demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean
maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially
compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the
real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility.
The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and
fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in
sensitive applications.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的跨数据集EEG解码框架AFPM，通过空间对齐和帧块编码提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG解码模型在跨数据集学习和泛化中的问题，如通道布局不一致、信号分布非平稳性及缺乏神经生理学先验。

Method: AFPM框架包含空间对齐（选择任务相关通道、对齐分布、统一布局）和帧块编码（将信号建模为统一时空块）。

Result: 在运动想象和事件相关电位任务上分别提升4.40%和3.58%的性能，优于17种现有方法。

Conclusion: AFPM是首个无需校准的跨数据集EEG解码框架，显著提升了BCI的实际应用性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel
layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited
neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a
plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has
two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels
based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and
remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding,
which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG
decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific
tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to
4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our
knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding
framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现生成式AI在表达“丑陋”时存在文化偏见，倾向于将丑陋与老年白人男性关联，反映了社会偏见和矛盾偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI如何理解和表达“丑陋”，揭示其中嵌入的文化偏见。

Method: 通过迭代提示提取13个形容词，生成624张图像，并进行人口和社会经济属性编码与主题分析。

Result: AI模型将丑陋与老年白人男性关联，同时避免对边缘群体的刻板描绘，导致对多数群体的负面投射。

Conclusion: 生成式AI仍延续偏见，需推动伦理训练和包容性开发方法。

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces
deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how
concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study
investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express
ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these
representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through
iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across
four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes
within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our
findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old
white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical
biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups
inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes
onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite
supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional
physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.
These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal
representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and
paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical
AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI
development.

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中于数据预处理而非真正的数据质量改进（DQI），且传统批处理数据预处理方法常导致数据特征失真，影响模型性能。

Method: 系统整合了数据驱动（如缺失值填充、异常检测、特征选择等）和流程驱动（如DQ评估、Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验）技术，通过可视化分析支持用户决策。

Result: 通过案例研究、评估和用户研究，验证了系统在结合专家知识和领域知识以提升DQI和模型性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: d-DQIVAR系统为数据质量改进提供了实用工具，结合了数据与流程驱动方法，显著提升了机器学习模型的性能。

Abstract: Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main
categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly
utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often
proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and
frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have
primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality
improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual
analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML
model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that
leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques
tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format
standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection.
Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by
considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness
expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through
case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

Conclusion: 数据集自适应工作流在不牺牲精度的情况下，显著提高了降维优化效率。

Abstract: Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and
determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of
the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often
resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we
propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural
complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a
dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to
represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately
represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us
to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given
dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design
and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We
quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth
complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding
dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our
dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR
optimization without compromising accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在代码质量分析中因静态训练数据限制而难以适应动态最佳实践的问题。

Method: 通过指令调优在合成数据上训练模型，支持从易到难的泛化，无需重新训练即可适应新代码模式。

Result: MetaLint在检测未见的PEP习惯用法上取得70.37%的F-score和70.43%的召回率，定位任务中达到26.73%的准确率。

Conclusion: MetaLint展示了在代码质量分析中的潜力，尤其是对新代码模式的适应性，未来有望进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

Motivation: SaaS市场的快速扩张导致定价管理复杂化，缺乏自动化工具限制了定价模型的高效评估和优化。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的技术，结合网页抓取和信息提取，从SaaS网站中提取定价组件、计划、功能等信息。

Result: 在30个商业SaaS数据集上验证了系统的有效性，但存在幻觉、复杂结构和动态内容等挑战。

Conclusion: 智能定价自动化能提升SaaS定价管理的效率和可扩展性，未来研究将优化提取能力和系统适应性。

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering
flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid
expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps
teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that
is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for
pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and
scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing
(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these
challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines
operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in
response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We
present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML
pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while
minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic
Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract
essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from
SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,
encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,
challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic
content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing
transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for
improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing
landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and
enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

TL;DR: GitChameleon是一个新的数据集，用于评估AI在特定库版本下生成可执行代码的能力，揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件库的快速更新对代码生成提出了挑战，现有基准缺乏基于执行的评估。

Method: 引入GitChameleon数据集，包含328个Python代码补全问题，每个问题绑定特定库版本并附带单元测试。

Result: 当前最先进的模型在此任务上表现不佳，企业模型成功率仅为48-51%。

Conclusion: GitChameleon为动态代码库的挑战提供了清晰的评估基准，有助于开发更可靠的AI代码生成方法。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for
code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version
updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution
benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset
comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific
library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon
rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),
LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform
version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy
through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art
systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models
achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the
intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing
the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer
understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more
adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and
evaluation code publicly available at
https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.

### [237] [Universal Fourier Neural Operators for Micromechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12233)
*Binh Huy Nguyen,Matti Schneider*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 本文提出使用傅里叶神经算子（FNOs）解决均质化中的单元问题，结合快速傅里叶变换（FFT）方法，实现高效且通用的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在解决均质化单元问题时速度和通用性不足，且缺乏明确的方向。本文旨在探索FNOs在微力学中的潜力，并建立FFT方法与FNOs之间的联系。

Method: 构建FNO替代模型，模仿FFT方法的基本框架，实现对任意刚度分布的单元问题的精确预测。

Result: FNO模型无需训练即可实现通用逼近，且运行时间与经典FFT求解器相当，能处理超1亿体素的大规模问题。

Conclusion: FNOs在微力学问题中具有巨大潜力，FFT与FNOs的结合有望促进两种方法的共同发展。

Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available
deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional
computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to
expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches
are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational
micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct
an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods
and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with
\emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast
constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions
on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the
geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is
sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical
empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we
construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the
obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the
basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In
particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily
handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for
solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This
connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.

### [238] [Improved Analysis for Sign-based Methods with Momentum Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12091)
*Wei Jiang,Dingzhi Yu,Sifan Yang,Wenhao Yang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization
algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the
separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume
unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we
demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate
using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under
the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior
momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$
is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with
majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based
method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +
dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},
d^{1/10}T^{-1/5} \} \right)$, which outperform the previous results of
$\mathcal{O}\left( dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(
d^{3/8}T^{-1/8} \right)$, respectively. Numerical experiments further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### [239] [Neural Polar Decoders for Deletion Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12329)
*Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于删除信道的神经极化解码器（NPD），通过降低计算复杂度（从O(N^4)降至O(AN log N)），扩展了极化码的应用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有极化解码器在删除信道中的计算复杂度高（O(N^4)），限制了其在中短块长中的应用。

Method: 扩展NPD架构以支持删除信道，仅修改其中一个神经网络，同时引入用户可调的计算预算参数A。

Result: 在删除率δ∈{0.01,0.1}的信道中验证了NPD的性能，并通过列表解码进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 扩展的NPD在降低复杂度的同时保持了性能，未来可能应用于DNA存储等领域。

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with
a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit
high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This
limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to
short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing
NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we
extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,
the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating
fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support
deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational
complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a
computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.
We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates
$\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by
the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced
complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further
improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have
applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

*Brendan Murphy,Dillon Bowen,Shahrad Mohammadzadeh,Julius Broomfield,Adam Gleave,Kellin Pelrine*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出一种名为jailbreak-tuning的方法，能够通过微调生成高质量的有害内容，绕过现有防护系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统防护措施不足，前沿模型开发者虽意识到严重滥用的风险，但现有方法无法完全阻止有害内容的生成。

Method: 采用jailbreak-tuning方法，通过微调模型（无论是开放权重还是封闭API）生成详细且高质量的有害响应。

Result: 实验显示，OpenAI、Google和Anthropic的模型会完全配合有害请求（如CBRN协助、网络攻击等），且攻击的隐蔽性和严重性可通过后门增强。

Conclusion: 当前模型对攻击的脆弱性加剧，亟需开发防篡改的防护措施。在未解决前，发布可微调模型等同于释放其恶意版本。

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release
of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally
capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩适应方法冻结所有层，限制了模型灵活性。本文旨在通过部分解冻（如补丁嵌入层）和低秩分解，提升训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 在ViT的每一层注入可训练的低秩分解矩阵，同时不解冻补丁嵌入层，以减少可训练参数并保持精度。

Result: 方法显著减少可训练参数，同时保持与全参数微调相近的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护ViT训练中高效且有效，平衡了参数效率和模型性能。

Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving
vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model
weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are
injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch
embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank
adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number
of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示ML实践中安全性和文档化的不足，并提出改进方案以填补这一空白。

Method: 方法包括文献综述和基于现有标准（如Model Cards和Datasheets for Datasets）扩展安全性文档的建议。

Result: 结果显示ML实践者对安全性意识不足，文档质量低，现有标准未得到广泛应用。

Conclusion: 结论是需要改进ML文档中的安全性内容，并提出了扩展文档标准的建议。

Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the
documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice
based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally
low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and
an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low
quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in
practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due
to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in
ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve
this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for
ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant
information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security
requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model
Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to
adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.

TL;DR: IDFace是一种基于同态加密的高效安全人脸识别方法，通过模板表示转换和空间高效编码技术，显著提升了加密模板的匹配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人脸识别系统的广泛应用，用户隐私保护变得尤为重要，尤其是防止从模板中恢复人脸图像特征。现有同态加密方法效率低下，亟需一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Method: IDFace采用两种新技术：模板表示转换降低匹配测试成本，空间高效编码减少加密算法的空间浪费。

Result: 实验表明，IDFace能在126毫秒内从100万个加密模板中识别出人脸模板，仅比明文识别慢2倍。

Conclusion: IDFace在保护隐私的同时，显著提升了加密人脸识别的效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy
becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's
face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered
from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as
homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,
HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In
particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is
basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined
shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and
the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based
face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain
systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based
secure and efficient face identification method with template protection.
IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching
on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The
first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply
reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient
encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving
the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show
that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted
templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification
over plaintexts.

Conclusion: 为广告推荐中的隐私保护技术提供了实用解决方案和理论基础。

Abstract: To mitigate privacy leakage and performance issues in personalized
advertising, this paper proposes a framework that integrates federated learning
and differential privacy. The system combines distributed feature extraction,
dynamic privacy budget allocation, and robust model aggregation to balance
model accuracy, communication overhead, and privacy protection. Multi-party

resilience against malicious attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the
framework achieves dual optimization of recommendation accuracy and system
efficiency while ensuring privacy, providing both a practical solution and a
theoretical foundation for applying privacy protection technologies in
advertisement recommendation.

Motivation: 现代数字天空调查获取了数十亿星系的图像，但高精度分析需要有效的自动化方法。现有方法通常依赖于基于预定义类别的机器学习标注，限制了分析的灵活性。

Method: 采用生成式AI技术，将星系图像简化为“骨架化”形式，避免了预定义类别的限制。

Result: 该方法应用于125,000张DESI Legacy Survey图像，生成的简化图像目录已公开。

Conclusion: 新方法为星系图像分析提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of
galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the
shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images
requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning
annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we
introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative
AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them
into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements
of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined
set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images
acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.
The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of
the simplified images is publicly available.

Motivation: 在数据稀缺的情况下，发现准确且物理可解释的描述符以理解和预测氧化物钙钛矿催化剂的OER活性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用小数据集和七个结构特征，通过符号回归改进已知描述符；第二阶段扩展到164个特征，降维并识别关键电子描述符。

Result: 最终公式结合了改进的结构描述符和电子描述符，训练和验证误差分别为22.1和20.6 meV，具有高准确性和物理可解释性。

Conclusion: 神经网络引导的符号回归在数据稀缺情况下能够发现准确且物理可解释的描述符，表明在材料信息学中可解释性不必牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate
and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to
discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs
and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural
networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to
discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In
Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and
improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and
applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8
and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce
dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A
final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved
accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong
physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic
regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful
descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need
not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.

Result: 研究发现并非所有模态都能提供独特见解，但多模态方法能更全面地捕捉协调动态。

Conclusion: 多模态方法提升了检测和分析在线协调行为的能力，为数字平台完整性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions
to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key
focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on
monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets
or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.
However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in
multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing
the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off
between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the
balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly
coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we
assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how
varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our
findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that
with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of
coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze
coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the
integrity of digital platforms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层协作的匝道合并控制框架（HCOMC），用于解决混合交通流中的匝道合并问题，结合纵向跟车模型和横向换道模型，并通过仿真验证了其优越性。


<details>

Motivation: 高速公路匝道合并区域是交通拥堵和事故的常见瓶颈，而基于联网自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的协作控制策略是解决这一问题的根本方法。但由于CAV尚未普及，需要为混合交通流设计一种分层协作控制框架。

Result: 仿真结果表明，HCOMC在提升车辆群安全性、稳定和加速合并过程、优化交通效率和节约燃油消耗方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: HCOMC框架为混合交通流中的匝道合并问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

TL;DR: 利用深度生成模型提升自动驾驶车辆在交叉路口的安全性，通过单步去噪扩散模型快速生成潜在碰撞场景，优化决策规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险交通区域（如交叉路口）是碰撞的主要原因，研究旨在提升自动驾驶车辆在此类场景下的安全性。

Method: 训练1000步去噪扩散概率模型生成碰撞传感器噪声序列，并通过生成对抗架构将其蒸馏为单步模型，用于快速推理。

Result: 单步模型在保持采样质量的同时显著提升推理速度，基于该模型的规划器在仿真实验中表现出更低的失败率和延迟率。

Conclusion: 单步去噪扩散模型可有效应用于自动驾驶规划，显著提升安全性和效率。

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous
riding systems for future urban mobility.

Result: 提出了一种多级相似性匹配框架和新型点云几何描述符（C-FPFH），提高了匹配精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在单视角条件下实现了对未知物体的鲁棒抓取，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Motivation: 传统机器人模仿学习依赖真实机器人数据，但硬件限制导致数据规模受限。人类视频不仅规模大，且场景和任务更丰富，为机器人学习提供了新途径。

Method: 使用人类视频训练VLA模型预测人类手腕和手部动作，通过逆运动学和重定向转换为机器人动作，并用少量机器人演示微调模型（EgoVLA）。

Conclusion: 人类视频为机器人学习提供了高效数据源，结合少量机器人演示可显著提升性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

### [256] [JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11636)
*Junyi Fan,Donald Williamson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: JSQA框架通过感知引导的对比预训练和微调，显著提升了语音质量评估（SQA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOS标签的高方差性导致传统方法难以准确评估语音质量，而现有方法未充分融入感知因素。

Method: JSQA采用两阶段框架：1）基于JND对的感知对比预训练音频编码器；2）微调用于MOS预测。

Result: 实验表明，感知对比预训练显著提升了模型性能，优于从头训练的模型。

Conclusion: 融入感知因素的预训练对SQA性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a
high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score
(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging
for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent
variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions
have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual
factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead
to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework
that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning
on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS
prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are
then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity
information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean
LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at
different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with
audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results
suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly
improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared
against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These
findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly
contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对IIoT边缘计算环境的AIGC任务卸载框架，首次考虑了模型切换的延迟和能耗，并设计了基于MADDPG的算法（MADDPG-MATO），实验表明其性能优于基线算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IIoT与AIGC的结合为智能制造带来新机遇，但也面临计算密集和低延迟的挑战，传统云计算方法难以满足实时需求。

Method: 提出AIGC任务卸载框架，考虑模型切换的延迟和能耗，设计基于MADDPG的多智能体任务卸载算法（MADDPG-MATO）。

Result: 实验显示MADDPG-MATO在延迟、能耗和任务完成率上优于基线算法，平均延迟减少6.98%，能耗降低7.12%，任务完成率提高3.72%。

Conclusion: MADDPG-MATO在动态高负载IIoT环境中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial
Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart
manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to
computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative
models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can
effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature
of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher
demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing
environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC
model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent
collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge
servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task
offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental
results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an
average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%
increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model
numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is
robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

TL;DR: PGT-I扩展了PyTorch Geometric Temporal，通过分布式数据并行训练和两种新策略（index-batching和distributed-index-batching）解决了ST-GNNs在大规模数据集上的内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ST-GNNs在建模时空数据依赖方面表现强大，但受限于内存问题，主要应用于小规模数据集。分布式训练缺乏对时空模型的支持，且未充分利用时空数据特性。

Method: 提出了PGT-I，结合分布式数据并行训练和两种新策略：index-batching（动态构建快照以减少内存开销）和distributed-index-batching（支持多GPU扩展）。

Result: 在PeMS数据集上首次实现无需图分区的ST-GNN训练，峰值内存使用减少89%，128 GPU下速度提升13.1倍。

Conclusion: PGT-I通过优化内存和计算效率，显著提升了ST-GNNs在大规模数据集上的应用潜力。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for
modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications
have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory
constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks
lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of
spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we
present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch
Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two
novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index
techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically
at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while
distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable
processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training
of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing
peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over
standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态检索增强生成（RAG）的实用方法，通过混合搜索和重排序技术提升检索效率，同时保持性能质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息提取系统无法处理多模态数据（如图表、图像等），而现有多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在检索效率和扩展性方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用混合搜索（元数据和嵌入）和先进的交互重排序技术，结合MLLM生成答案。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在速度和稳定性上表现优异，适合企业级生产系统。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态检索中实现了高效和可扩展性，且不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的序列推荐模型是黑盒模型，难以解释。研究其内部机制有助于理解和控制模型行为，对实际应用非常重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）从Transformer的隐藏状态中提取稀疏线性组合的可解释特征。

Result: SAE提取的特征比原始隐藏状态更具可解释性和单义性，并能灵活控制模型行为。

Conclusion: SAE在序列推荐任务中具有潜力，能提升模型的可解释性和可控性。

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based
on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box
models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their
internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is
very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse
autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for
extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders
learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from
sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential
recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied
to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned
directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original
hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by
SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior,
providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their
recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

Conclusion: 通过调整推荐系统的公平性指标，可以实现个性化与多样性的平衡，从而避免过滤气泡的社会负面影响。

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday
experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries
online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of
building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social
media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several
perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the
content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating
the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern
across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes
place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so
tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of
opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's
perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's
perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of
potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are
far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political
decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation
of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?
Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to
represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through
the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation
framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and
the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of
view.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形式验证方法因状态空间探索而面临可扩展性挑战，需要一种更高效的方法来验证神经证书的安全性。

Method: 设计了一个运行时监控框架，通过实时观察系统并在有限预测范围内动态验证证书条件，无需访问底层控制策略。

Result: 在ReLU控制屏障函数的案例中，该方法能及时检测安全违规和错误证书，且开销极小。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经证书的验证提供了一种轻量级且高效的替代方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems
control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as
barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,
serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal
verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability
challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this
challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that
integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying
control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs
on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure
safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for
ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety
violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an
effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the
certificates.

Motivation: 现有HDC模型在表示复杂的类-子类关系时面临挑战，尤其是分解任务，这对神经符号AI系统至关重要。

Method: FactorHD采用符号编码方法嵌入额外记忆子句，并设计高效分解算法选择性消除冗余类。

Result: FactorHD在表示规模为10^9时速度提升约5667倍，与ResNet-18结合时在Cifar-10数据集上达到92.48%分解准确率。

Conclusion: FactorHD克服了现有HDC模型的局限性，为神经符号AI系统提供了更高效的类-子类关系处理方案。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

Conclusion: ORAN与NTN的结合为6G网络提供了高效、可靠和灵活的解决方案，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications
have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient,
reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures,
the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have
received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the
deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves
the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN
present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,
hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native
artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in
disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works
propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN
deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a
holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps
lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses
the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first
provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the
state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges
that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based
NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These

controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment
architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research

enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are

### [266] [LLM-Based Config Synthesis requires Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12443)
*Rajdeep Mondal,Nikolaj Bjorner,Todd Millstein,Alan Tang,George Varghese*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在程序合成中的用户意图模糊问题，提出了一种原型系统Clarify，通过Disambiguator模块解决模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于LLM的增量配置合成中，用户意图的模糊性（如路由映射和ACL的重叠）导致优先级无法推断，需用户交互解决。

Method: 提出Clarify系统，结合LLM和Disambiguator模块，通过用户交互澄清意图，合成路由策略并验证。

Result: 在大型云环境中，复杂ACL存在数百次重叠，验证了模糊性问题的实际存在。

Conclusion: Clarify系统能有效解决LLM合成中的模糊性问题，适用于意图明确但集成模糊的场景。

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MOFSimBench是一个评估通用机器学习原子间势（uMLIPs）在纳米多孔材料建模中性能的基准测试，结果表明uMLIPs在多种任务中优于传统力场和微调机器学习势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估uMLIPs在纳米多孔材料（如MOFs）建模中的可靠性和有效性，这些材料在碳捕获、能源存储和催化等领域具有重要应用。

Method: 引入MOFSimBench基准测试，评估uMLIPs在结构优化、分子动力学稳定性、体相性质预测和客体-主体相互作用等任务中的表现。

Result: 性能最佳的uMLIPs在所有任务中均优于传统力场和微调机器学习势，数据质量（如训练集的多样性和非平衡构象的包含）对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: uMLIPs已准备好用于纳米多孔材料建模，MOFSimBench为uMLIPs的进一步开发和采用提供了开放资源。

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as
powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and
efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their
reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an
open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials
are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy
storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents
distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural
complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from
existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to
evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials,
including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the
prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and
guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures
on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that
top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and
fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their
readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis
highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and
inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than
model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We
release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at
https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide
the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of
uMLIPs.

TL;DR: 通过非侵入性脑机接口（BCI）解码自发、精细的自我中心6D位姿，揭示被动条件下大脑空间系统的自发运作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然被动体验下大规模神经动力学如何支持空间表征，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 基于EEG的BCI解码被动观看自我中心视频时的6D位姿，分析视觉输入对解码性能的影响。

Result: 空间一致的视觉输入可解码，100ms帧率性能最佳，揭示分布式神经编码机制。

Conclusion: 大脑空间系统在被动条件下仍自发运作，挑战主动与被动空间认知的传统区分。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

Method: 采用流匹配的生成模型（CosmoFlow）处理冷暗物质模拟数据，学习紧凑的潜在表示。

usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种空间物理信息模型（SPIM），用于改进高级封装中的非破坏性测试（NDT），通过磁图像增强、对齐和磁场转换方法，显著提升了测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高级封装的非破坏性测试因层深和复杂性而变得困难，现有方法未考虑涡流效应和图像对齐问题，亟需改进。

Method: SPIM包含三个关键部分：磁图像增强（利用I/Q通道图像）、磁图像对齐（解决扫描偏差）以及结合毕奥-萨伐尔定律和FFT的磁场转换方法。

Result: SPIM使I通道清晰度提升0.3%，Q通道清晰度降低25%，并成功消除了0.30的旋转和偏差。

Conclusion: SPIM展示了空间分析与物理驱动模型结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将这些任务分开处理，而RUMAA通过预训练的乐谱和音频编码器以及新型三流解码器，实现了任务间的统一处理。

Method: RUMAA使用预训练的乐谱和音频编码器，结合三流解码器，通过代理任务捕捉任务间的依赖关系。

Result: 在公开钢琴音乐数据集上，RUMAA在非重复乐谱上达到最先进的对齐效果，在重复乐谱上表现更优，同时提供有前景的转录和错误检测结果。

Conclusion: RUMAA通过统一框架显著提升了音乐表演分析的效率和准确性。

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music
performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment,
score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end
manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA
integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel
tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It
aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length
performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on
manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA
matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and
outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while
also delivering promising transcription and mistake detection results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归TTS方法因单码本表示导致信息丢失，难以恢复细节（如韵律、音色），尤其在复杂场景（如歌声合成）中表现不佳。

Method: QTTS采用QDAC编解码器，结合分层并行架构（双自回归结构建模码本依赖）和延迟多头方法（并行预测加速推理）。

Result: 实验表明QTTS合成质量更高，能更好保留表达内容，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多码本建模是实现高保真、通用语音和音频生成的有前景方向。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete
modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on
single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information
loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these
methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,
speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing
voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our
new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end
training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves
superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless
compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:
the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model
inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay
Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to
accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive
content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via
multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity,
general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3
of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In
previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge
investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change
shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene
analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited
field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,
the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane
(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided
into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track
introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification
necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3
Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled
and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to
process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to
the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates
onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation
metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,
which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are
onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs
reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

Conclusion: Hebbian学习为群体机器人提供了一种高效、无需复杂先验知识的异质性控制方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm
robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning
presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies
on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for
learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of
attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,
thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules
across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the
curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian
learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive
prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This
work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,
resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved
swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning
rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in
standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling
narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain
results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We
introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted
principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses,
Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary

Motivation: 现有3D表示方法（如网格、NeRF等）在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间存在显著局限性，无法同时满足重建、生成、编辑和驱动等任务的需求。

Method: 通过稀疏的分层组织（树状结构）代理节点表示物体的形状和纹理，每个节点存储局部形状和纹理信息（由小型MLP隐式编码），并通过神经插值和轻量解码实现高效查询。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在3D重建和编辑中表现出高效的表达能力、高保真渲染质量和卓越的可编辑性。

Conclusion: 提出的3D分层代理节点表示方法在通用性、编辑性和复杂性之间取得了显著平衡，为3D表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

Motivation: 空间转录组技术（ST）能保留细胞空间信息，但建模复杂数据需整合多尺度信息，因此需要高效的基础模型。

Method: SToFM通过多尺度信息提取构建ST子切片，使用SE(2) Transformer生成高质量细胞表征，并构建大规模预训练数据集SToCorpus-88M。

Result: SToFM在下游任务（如组织区域语义分割和细胞类型注释）中表现优异。

Conclusion: SToFM能全面理解空间转录组数据，为生物组织分析提供新视角。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich
insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells.
Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of
vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of
biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to
the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast
numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue
morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene
expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale
Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale
information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices
that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2)
Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the
sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves
outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region
semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive
understanding of ST data

### [281] [RNAMunin: A Deep Machine Learning Model for Non-coding RNA Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11950)
*Lauren Lui,Torben Nielsen*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: RNAMunin是一种基于机器学习的模型，仅通过基因组序列即可识别非编码RNA（ncRNA），适用于大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前微生物基因组的注释偏重于蛋白质编码基因，而ncRNA在调控细菌和古菌生理、应激反应和代谢中起关键作用，但缺乏高效的大规模识别工具。

Method: RNAMunin基于Rfam序列训练，使用约60 Gbp的长读长宏基因组数据，仅需基因组序列输入，无需转录组数据。

Result: RNAMunin是目前唯一能在如此大规模下仅依赖基因组序列检测ncRNA的模型，且参数少（约1M）、速度快。

Conclusion: RNAMunin填补了ncRNA识别工具的空白，为研究微生物全基因组调控潜力提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward
protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology,
stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic
sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for
understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper
presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding
ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for
large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs
totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from
approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary
samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on
genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence
as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do
not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in
order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail.
Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin
is very small and very fast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学创新面临信息过载、学科壁垒和传统方法回报递减等问题，LLMs有望成为变革性工具，但现有研究对其潜力和角色区分理解不足。

Method: 通过分析当前方法、基准和系统，提出一个分层框架（评估者、合作者、科学家），明确LLMs在不同科学任务中的贡献和交互模式。

Result: LLMs不仅能自动化现有流程，还能重塑科学的认识论基础，但需解决开放挑战和伦理问题。

Conclusion: 该调查为未来研究提供了概念清晰性、实践指导和理论基础，同时强调了LLMs在科学创新中的潜力和限制。

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid
advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting
challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing
returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents
capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in
and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus
on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and
discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative
potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive
framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation
across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We
distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research
processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified
taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and
human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of
current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey
delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific
innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing
processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological
foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical
guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also
highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of
increasingly autonomous AI-driven science. Resources related to this survey can

Motivation: 构建最优治疗策略值的置信区间是因果推断中的重要问题，但现有方法存在参数假设过强或计算复杂度高的问题。

Method: 通过控制一阶偏差和二阶余项，提出了一种基于软最大平滑的估计器，适用于涉及干扰组分的评分最大值参数估计。

Result: 该估计器实现了√n收敛速率，避免了参数限制和不现实的边界假设，且通常具有统计效率。

Conclusion: 软最大平滑方法为最优治疗策略值估计提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment
policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal
policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized
treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal
value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing
inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this
non-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators
based on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These
approaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic
parametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches
that directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place
parametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the
computation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic
$L^\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that
prohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of
constructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By
carefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show
that a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters
that are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In
particular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a
special case. Our estimator obtains $\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids
parametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often
statistically efficient.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文比较了Transformer、SSM和混合模型在长上下文推理任务中的性能，发现SSM在长序列处理上表现更优，适合边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer架构在处理长上下文输入时效率低下，需要研究更适合边缘设备的新架构。

Method: 通过系统性能测试比较Transformer、SSM和混合模型在消费级和嵌入式GPU上的表现。

Result: SSM在长序列处理上优于Transformer，能处理更长的序列（220K tokens），且在长上下文（~57K tokens）下速度更快（4x）。

Conclusion: SSM是边缘设备长上下文处理的理想选择，未来硬件优化应关注SSM内核。

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous,
long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic
complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures
make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a
paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and
hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses
on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic
performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically
needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of
carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for
long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that
SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing
sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than
comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short
sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x
faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals
that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,
accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a
primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed,
device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the
edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization
framework.

### [285] [CompressedVQA-HDR: Generalized Full-reference and No-reference Quality Assessment Models for Compressed High Dynamic Range Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11900)
*Wei Sun,Linhan Cao,Kang Fu,Dandan Zhu,Jun Jia,Menghan Hu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出CompressedVQA-HDR框架，针对HDR视频质量评估，采用Swin Transformer和SigLip 2作为骨干网络，分别构建全参考（FR）和无参考（NR）VQA模型，通过预训练和微调策略解决数据不足问题，实验表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩视频质量评估（VQA）方法泛化能力不足，难以应对HDR视频多样性，需开发更有效的评估框架。

Method: FR模型使用Swin Transformer提取结构和纹理相似性；NR模型使用SigLip 2提取全局特征。通过预训练和混合数据集训练策略优化模型。

Result: 模型在FR和NR任务中表现最优，CompressedVQA-HDR-FR在IEEE ICME 2025挑战赛中获FR赛道第一名。

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR框架有效解决了HDR视频质量评估问题，为压缩视频质量评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合YOLO和SAM的混合模型，用于精确分割骨科骨盆X光片中的解剖标志和复杂轮廓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用分割模型（如SAM和MedSAM）无法直接用于医学影像中的精细解剖标志分割，需要特定提示。

Method: 利用YOLO生成边界框作为SAM的输入提示，结合两者的优势，构建混合模型。

Result: 模型在分割8个解剖标志的基础上，扩展到72个标志和16个复杂轮廓区域，表现优异。

Conclusion: YOLO和SAM的结合为骨科骨盆X光片的解剖标志分割提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Motivation: MR成像在临床诊断和治疗中日益重要，但现有的MR-to-CT合成方法在空间对齐和图像质量上存在问题，影响下游临床任务的可靠性。

Method: 通过在小波潜在空间中进行模态转换，结合小波残差模块增强特征捕获，并引入双跳跃连接注意力机制以生成高分辨率CT图像。

Result: 模型能够生成空间对齐良好、解剖结构保持完整的高质量CT图像，显著提升了骨结构和软组织对比度的表现。

Conclusion: 3D-WLDM为MR-to-CT合成提供了一种有效的解决方案，有望在临床应用中提高诊断和治疗的准确性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

Motivation: 新生儿肺动脉高压的诊断依赖超声心动图，但其准确性受操作者主观性影响，且现有自动化方法多针对成人，泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，从多视角超声心动图视频中提取复杂潜在表征，并与单视角和监督学习方法对比。

Result: 结果显示多视角学习方法在泛化能力和分类准确性上优于单视角和监督学习方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习能有效提升新生儿肺动脉高压评估的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

Result: SAM等基础模型在整体配准上表现优异，但对细节（如纤维腺组织）处理不足；医学特定预训练未提升性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究领域特定训练对配准的影响，并开发提升全局配准和细节准确性的策略。

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration
performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to
understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore
targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure
accuracy. We also publicly release our code at
\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset

Method: 基于qubit相空间和Stratonovich-Weyl对应关系，构建了一元和多元qubit系统的封闭、可组合动态形式，将Pauli群的算子代数替换为辛流形上的函数动力学。

Result: 该方法将维度灾难转化为谐波支持问题，其计算域随qubit数量线性增长，为基于相空间变分建模的QML开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: 相空间方法为QML提供了一种更高效的计算框架，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

TL;DR: BenchRL-QAS是一个统一的基准测试框架，用于系统评估量子架构搜索（QAS）中的强化学习（RL）算法，涵盖多种任务和系统规模。研究发现RL算法的性能高度依赖任务背景，支持“没有免费午餐”原则。

Motivation: 为量子电路设计提供系统化的RL算法评估，推动量子计算的发展。

Method: 在2-8量子比特范围内，对9种RL代理（包括值基和策略梯度方法）进行基准测试，提出加权排名指标。

Result: RL量子分类器优于基线变分分类器，但无单一RL算法在所有任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: RL在量子电路设计中的性能高度依赖任务背景，需定制化算法选择和系统基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made
publicly available to support reproducibility and future research

### [295] [Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12256)
*Monica Lăcătuş,Matthias Möller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种替代量子电路（SQC）框架，用于近似D2Q9格子上的BGK碰撞算子，解决了量子计算中非线性碰撞步骤的实现难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFD工具在高雷诺数湍流模拟中存在挑战，量子计算有望提供速度优势，但非线性碰撞步骤的低深度量子电路实现仍是一个难题。

Method: 通过训练一个四量子比特电路（SQC）来近似BGK碰撞算子，确保其满足物理性质（如质量和动量守恒），并在IBM Heron处理器上验证。

Result: SQC仅需2,430个原生门，无需辅助量子比特或后选择，且深度与网格分辨率无关，成功模拟了泰勒-格林涡旋衰减和盖驱动腔流。

Conclusion: SQC为量子CFD提供了一种高效、物理准确的碰撞算子实现方法，展示了量子并行性的潜力。

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

Result: 发现AI工具需结合人工监督，建议混合评估模型和AI素养教育。

Conclusion: 成功整合AI需平衡伦理、教学和技术因素，未来研究可关注AI准确性和学术诚信。

Abstract: This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and
Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy,
authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both
the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI
improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such
as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between
AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for
addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid
assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias
detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and
educators. Our findings suggest that the successful integration of AI requires
a balanced approach, considering ethical, pedagogical, and technical factors.
Future research may explore enhancing AI accuracy, preserving academic
integrity, and developing adaptive models that balance creativity with
precision.

*Kevin T Webster*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，生成式AI在简历筛选中存在种族和性别偏见，且部分模型仅依赖关键词匹配而非实质性评估，提出了‘中立错觉’概念，建议双重验证框架以确保公平有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在简历筛选中是否真正具备评估能力，而非仅因缺乏偏见而显得中立。

Method: 通过两部分实验审计八种主要AI平台：实验1检测种族和性别偏见，实验2评估核心能力。

Result: 发现部分模型存在偏见，另一些则因无法实质性评估而显得‘中立’，提出‘中立错觉’概念。

Conclusion: 建议采用双重验证框架，同时审计AI工具的偏见和实际能力，以确保其公平性和有效性。

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 鼓励AI工具发展，但需持续培训以确保研究的有效性和伦理价值。

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys,
synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While
the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not
always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice
(TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models
for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024),
we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic
AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human
analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their
tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier
eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using
statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully
understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize
a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018)
throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role
that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging
the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for
continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value
of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon
results most effectively and ethically.

Abstract: The emergence of breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has led
to a renewed focus on how small data settings, i.e., settings with limited

such as how best to include under-represented groups in data-driven policy and
decision making, or the health benefits of assistive technologies such as
wearables. We provide a conceptual overview, in particular contrasting small
data with big data, and identify common themes from exemplary case studies and
application areas. Potential solutions are described in a more detailed
technical overview of current data analysis and modelling techniques,
highlighting contributions from different disciplines, such as knowledge-driven
modelling from statistics and data-driven modelling from computer science. By
linking application settings, conceptual contributions and specific techniques,
we highlight what is already feasible and suggest what an agenda for fully

### [300] [The Safety Gap Toolkit: Evaluating Hidden Dangers of Open-Source Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11544)
*Ann-Kathrin Dombrowski,Dillon Bowen,Adam Gleave,Chris Cundy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开源大型语言模型（LLMs）的可修改性带来了创新和风险，研究团队开发了一个工具包来评估其安全性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究开源LLMs的可修改性可能导致的安全隐患，特别是模型规模增大时，移除安全措施会显著增加危险能力。

Method: 开源了一个工具包，评估不同参数规模（0.5B至405B）的Llama-3和Qwen-2.5模型，测试生化、网络能力、拒绝率和生成质量。

Result: 实验显示，随着模型规模增大，安全性差距扩大，移除安全措施后危险能力显著增强。

Conclusion: 工具包旨在为开源模型提供评估框架，并推动开发抗篡改安全措施，欢迎社区贡献。

Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation,
personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage -
modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially
subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This
leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a
model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those
safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for
state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical
and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from
two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to
405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that
the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous
capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the
Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve
as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation
for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome
contributions to the toolkit from the community.
