### [1] [Evaluating Reasoning LLMs for Suicide Screening with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13480)
*Avinash Patil,Siru Tao,Amardeep Gedhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自杀风险评估中的表现，发现Claude和GPT与人类标注接近，Mistral在顺序预测误差上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台如Reddit的r/SuicideWatch为自杀倾向者提供支持，但LLMs可能成为新的倾诉对象，因此需评估其风险评估能力。

Method: 使用哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表（C-SSRS）对六种LLMs（包括Claude、GPT、Mistral和LLaMA）进行零样本性能评估。

Result: Claude和GPT表现接近人类标注，Mistral顺序预测误差最低，多数模型对相邻严重级别敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人类监督、透明度和谨慎部署的重要性，并提供了完整代码和补充材料。

Abstract: Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online
platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for
individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent
of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may
begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates
the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot
performance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in
classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results
indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while
Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit
ordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between
adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns,
misclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the
importance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment. Full code

### [2] [EmoMeta: A Multimodal Dataset for Fine-grained Emotion Classification in Chinese Metaphors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13483)
*Xingyuan Lu,Yuxi Liu,Dongyu Zhang,Zhiyao Wu,Jing Ren,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一个中文多模态隐喻广告数据集，用于细粒度情感分类，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态隐喻在情感表达中日益重要，但相关数据集和研究稀缺，尤其是非英语语言。

Method: 构建包含5000个文本-图像对的中文数据集，标注隐喻、领域关系和细粒度情感。

Result: 数据集公开可用，支持多模态隐喻和情感分类的进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为多模态隐喻情感研究提供了重要资源，促进了领域发展。

Abstract: Metaphors play a pivotal role in expressing emotions, making them crucial for
emotional intelligence. The advent of multimodal data and widespread
communication has led to a proliferation of multimodal metaphors, amplifying
the complexity of emotion classification compared to single-mode scenarios.
However, the scarcity of research on constructing multimodal metaphorical
fine-grained emotion datasets hampers progress in this domain. Moreover,
existing studies predominantly focus on English, overlooking potential
variations in emotional nuances across languages. To address these gaps, we
introduce a multimodal dataset in Chinese comprising 5,000 text-image pairs of
metaphorical advertisements. Each entry is meticulously annotated for metaphor
occurrence, domain relations and fine-grained emotion classification
encompassing joy, love, trust, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise,
anticipation, and neutral. Our dataset is publicly accessible
(https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/EmoMeta), facilitating further advancements in
this burgeoning field.

### [3] [Detecting Prefix Bias in LLM-based Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13487)
*Ashwin Kumar,Yuzi He,Aram H. Markosyan,Bobbie Chern,Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中奖励模型的偏见问题，特别是前缀偏见，并提出了一种数据增强方法来减轻这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RLHF中奖励模型可能存在的偏见，尤其是由查询前缀微小变化引发的系统性偏见，以促进公平AI的发展。

Method: 引入新方法检测和评估前缀偏见，利用这些指标揭示种族和性别维度的偏见，并提出数据增强策略减轻偏见。

Result: 研究发现不同开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构均易受前缀偏见影响，数据增强方法能有效减少偏见。

Conclusion: 强调在设计公平可靠的奖励模型时需关注偏见问题，为AI公平性讨论提供重要见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

### [4] [Source framing triggers systematic evaluation bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13488)
*Federico Germani,Giovanni Spitale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在评估文本时存在一致性和偏见问题，尤其是当文本来源被标注为中国作者时，模型间的评分一致性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文本评估中的一致性、偏见及框架效应，以确保其评估的公正性和中立性。

Method: 使用四种先进LLMs（OpenAI o3-mini、Deepseek Reasoner、xAI Grok 2和Mistral）评估4800条叙述性声明，共192000次评估，并操纵声明来源（LLM或特定国籍人类作者）。

Result: 在无来源标注时，LLMs评分高度一致；但标注为中国作者时，一致性显著下降，尤其是Deepseek Reasoner。

Conclusion: 框架效应对LLMs文本评估有深远影响，需关注其在中立性和公平性方面的潜在问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used not only to generate text
but also to evaluate it, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments
are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. In this study, we
systematically examine inter- and intra-model agreement across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (OpenAI o3-mini, Deepseek Reasoner, xAI Grok 2, and
Mistral) tasked with evaluating 4,800 narrative statements on 24 different
topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of
192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to
assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified
nationality affects evaluation outcomes. We find that, in the blind condition,
different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intra-model
agreement across topics. However, this alignment breaks down when source
framing is introduced. Here we show that attributing statements to Chinese
individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models, and in
particular for Deepseek Reasoner. Our findings reveal that framing effects can
deeply affect text evaluation, with significant implications for the integrity,
neutrality, and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.

### [5] [ProdRev: A DNN framework for empowering customers using generative pre-trained transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13491)
*Aakash Gupta,Nataraj Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于生成预训练Transformer的框架，用于更好地理解和总结电商产品评论，帮助用户快速做出决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情期间，用户对电商的偏好增加，但大量评论可能导致决策瘫痪。现有工具虽能调整评分，但缺乏对评论的深入理解。

Method: 使用GPT3的Curie引擎微调生成模型，实现抽象性总结，而非简单的提取性总结。

Result: 模型能生成评论的优缺点，帮助用户快速理解并做出决策。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入“常识”元素，有效解决了评论过多导致的决策困难问题。

Abstract: Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has
accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes
running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis
for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected
to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them.
Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive
at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations.
This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained
transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using
"common-sense" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion
parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine
from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we
are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive
method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship
between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of
"common sense" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions.
The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the
user/customer can take their own decisions.

### [6] [LLM4CD: Leveraging Large Language Models for Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13492)
*Weiming Zhang,Lingyue Fu,Qingyao Li,Kounianhua Du,Jianghao Lin,Jingwei Yu,Wei Xia,Weinan Zhang,Ruiming Tang,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM4CD利用大型语言模型（LLM）的开放世界知识，通过语义表示增强认知诊断（CD），解决传统ID方法的局限性，并有效处理新学生和练习的冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CD方法仅依赖ID关系建模，忽视了教育数据中的丰富语义信息，且难以处理新学生和练习的冷启动问题。

Method: 提出LLM4CD，利用LLM的开放世界知识构建认知表达文本表示，并通过双层编码器框架（宏观认知文本编码器和微观知识状态编码器）建模学生测试历史。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM4CD在多个真实数据集上优于现有CD模型。

Conclusion: LLM4CD通过引入语义信息，显著提升了CD任务的性能，并解决了冷启动问题。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) plays a crucial role in intelligent education,
evaluating students' comprehension of knowledge concepts based on their test
histories. However, current CD methods often model students, exercises, and
knowledge concepts solely on their ID relationships, neglecting the abundant
semantic relationships present within educational data space. Furthermore,
contemporary intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) frequently involve the addition
of new students and exercises, a situation that ID-based methods find
challenging to manage effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs)
offers the potential for overcoming this challenge with open-world knowledge.
In this paper, we propose LLM4CD, which Leverages Large Language Models for
Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis. Our method utilizes the
open-world knowledge of LLMs to construct cognitively expressive textual
representations, which are then encoded to introduce rich semantic information
into the CD task. Additionally, we propose an innovative bi-level encoder
framework that models students' test histories through two levels of encoders:
a macro-level cognitive text encoder and a micro-level knowledge state encoder.
This approach substitutes traditional ID embeddings with semantic
representations, enabling the model to accommodate new students and exercises
with open-world knowledge and address the cold-start problem. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently
outperforms previous CD models on multiple real-world datasets, validating the
effectiveness of leveraging LLMs to introduce rich semantic information into
the CD task.

### [7] [IRLBench: A Multi-modal, Culturally Grounded, Parallel Irish-English Benchmark for Open-Ended LLM Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13498)
*Khanh-Tung Tran,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRLBench是一个新的多语言基准测试，专注于英语和爱尔兰语，填补了现有基准测试在低资源语言和文化偏见方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在文化偏见、仅限文本评估、多选格式以及对极低资源语言的限制，IRLBench旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过基于2024年爱尔兰毕业考试的12个代表性科目，采用长文本生成任务和官方评分标准，评估模型的正确性和语言保真度。

Result: 实验显示，领先的闭源和开源LLM在爱尔兰语上的表现显著低于英语，正确率分别为55.8%和76.2%。

Conclusion: IRLBench的发布旨在促进对稳健、文化敏感的多语言AI开发的未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their performance in multilingual and
low-resource settings remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often exhibit
cultural bias, restrict evaluation to text-only, rely on multiple-choice
formats, and, more importantly, are limited for extremely low-resource
languages. To address these gaps, we introduce IRLBench, presented in parallel
English and Irish, which is considered definitely endangered by UNESCO. Our
benchmark consists of 12 representative subjects developed from the 2024 Irish
Leaving Certificate exams, enabling fine-grained analysis of model capabilities
across domains. By framing the task as long-form generation and leveraging the
official marking scheme, it does not only support a comprehensive evaluation of
correctness but also language fidelity. Our extensive experiments of leading
closed-source and open-source LLMs reveal a persistent performance gap between
English and Irish, in which models produce valid Irish responses less than 80\%
of the time, and answer correctly 55.8\% of the time compared to 76.2\% in
English for the best-performing model. We release IRLBench
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/ReliableAI/IRLBench) and an accompanying
evaluation codebase (https://github.com/ReML-AI/IRLBench) to enable future
research on robust, culturally aware multilingual AI development.

### [8] [Noise Injection Systemically Degrades Large Language Model Safety Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13500)
*Prithviraj Singh Shahani,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，LLMs的安全防护在噪声扰动下脆弱，高斯噪声会增加有害输出率27%，且深度微调无额外保护。推理能力保持较好，需开发更鲁棒的安全技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs安全微调在噪声扰动下的鲁棒性，揭示现有安全对齐技术的脆弱性。

Method: 通过向模型激活中注入高斯噪声，系统评估安全微调的鲁棒性。

Result: 高斯噪声显著增加有害输出率（p<0.001），深度微调无额外保护，推理能力基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐技术存在漏洞，需探索基于推理和强化学习的更鲁棒方法。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in
preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety
fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model
activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise
raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety
fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought
reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities
in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of
reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction
for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important
implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications
as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even
without adversarial prompts.

### [9] [EcoSafeRAG: Efficient Security through Context Analysis in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13506)
*Ruobing Yao,Yifei Zhang,Shuang Song,Neng Gao,Chenyang Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EcoSafeRAG提出了一种不依赖LLM内部知识的方法，通过句子级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测来防御RAG中的恶意内容，同时提升性能并降低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG通过外部知识增强LLM的响应，但引入了新的攻击面（如语料库污染），现有防御方法依赖LLM内部知识，与RAG设计理念冲突。

Method: EcoSafeRAG采用句子级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测，分析候选文档的上下文多样性以识别恶意内容。

Result: 实验表明EcoSafeRAG在安全性和性能上表现优异（延迟1.2倍，令牌减少48%-80%）。

Conclusion: EcoSafeRAG在不依赖LLM内部知识的情况下，实现了高效防御和性能提升。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) compensates for the static knowledge
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge,
producing responses with enhanced factual correctness and query-specific
contextualization. However, it also introduces new attack surfaces such as
corpus poisoning at the same time. Most of the existing defense methods rely on
the internal knowledge of the model, which conflicts with the design concept of
RAG. To bridge the gap, EcoSafeRAG uses sentence-level processing and
bait-guided context diversity detection to identify malicious content by
analyzing the context diversity of candidate documents without relying on LLM
internal knowledge. Experiments show EcoSafeRAG delivers state-of-the-art
security with plug-and-play deployment, simultaneously improving clean-scenario
RAG performance while maintaining practical operational costs (relatively
1.2$\times$ latency, 48\%-80\% token reduction versus Vanilla RAG).

### [10] [Time-R1: Towards Comprehensive Temporal Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13508)
*Zijia Liu,Peixuan Han,Haofei Yu,Haoru Li,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Time-R1框架通过三阶段强化学习课程，赋予中等规模LLM全面时间能力，包括理解、预测和创造性生成，性能超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏稳健的时间智能，无法整合过去推理与未来预测和生成，且现有方法泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段强化学习课程，基于动态规则奖励系统，逐步构建时间理解、预测和创造性生成能力。

Result: Time-R1在预测和生成任务上表现优于200倍大的模型，如671B DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 精心设计的渐进式RL微调使小模型实现卓越时间性能，为时间感知AI提供实用路径，并发布Time-Bench数据集和Time-R1检查点。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack
robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past
with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing
methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering
about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization,
particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or
requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter)
LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and
creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development
path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL)
curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system.
This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and
logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction
skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables
remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any
fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms
models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1,
on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation
benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered,
progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior
temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly
time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench},
a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of
news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

### [11] [Induction Head Toxicity Mechanistically Explains Repetition Curse in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13514)
*Shuxun Wang,Qingyu Yin,Chak Tou Leong,Qiang Zhang,Linyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现诱导头是大型语言模型重复生成行为的关键驱动因素，并提出了一种注意力头正则化技术以减少其主导作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复诅咒现象在大型语言模型中广泛存在，但其机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示诱导头在其中的作用。

Method: 通过分析诱导头的毒性（即其在重复生成中的主导作用），提出注意力头正则化技术。

Result: 诱导头是重复诅咒的主要驱动因素，正则化技术可减少其主导作用。

Conclusion: 研究为重复诅咒提供了机制解释，并提出了缓解方法，有助于改进模型设计。

Abstract: Repetition curse is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate
repetitive sequences of tokens or cyclic sequences. While the repetition curse
has been widely observed, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
In this work, we investigate the role of induction heads--a specific type of
attention head known for their ability to perform in-context learning--in
driving this repetitive behavior. Specifically, we focus on the "toxicity" of
induction heads, which we define as their tendency to dominate the model's
output logits during repetition, effectively excluding other attention heads
from contributing to the generation process. Our findings have important
implications for the design and training of LLMs. By identifying induction
heads as a key driver of the repetition curse, we provide a mechanistic
explanation for this phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for mitigation.
We also propose a technique with attention head regularization that could be
employed to reduce the dominance of induction heads during generation, thereby
promoting more diverse and coherent outputs.

### [12] [Logic Jailbreak: Efficiently Unlocking LLM Safety Restrictions Through Formal Logical Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13527)
*Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Nan Wang,Xiangyu Zhao,Jiatong Li,Kai Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogiBreak是一种利用逻辑表达式翻译绕过LLM安全系统的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害自然语言提示转换为形式逻辑表达式，利用对齐数据和逻辑输入之间的分布差异，有效规避安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM与人类价值观的对齐取得了显著进展，但现有安全机制仍易受越狱攻击，作者认为这种脆弱性源于对齐导向提示与恶意提示之间的分布差异。

Method: 提出LogiBreak方法，通过将有害自然语言提示翻译为形式逻辑表达式，利用对齐数据与逻辑输入的分布差异规避安全系统。

Result: 在多语言越狱数据集上评估LogiBreak，证明其在多种评估设置和语言环境中均有效。

Conclusion: LogiBreak通过逻辑表达式翻译有效绕过LLM安全系统，揭示了当前对齐方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak
attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional
discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To
investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box
jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent
LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal
logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between
alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic
intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak
on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its
effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

### [13] [Combining the Best of Both Worlds: A Method for Hybrid NMT and LLM Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13554)
*Zhanglin Wu,Daimeng Wei,Xiaoyu Chen,Hengchao Shang,Jiaxin Guo,Zongyao Li,Yuanchang Luo,Jinlong Yang,Zhiqiang Rao,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合NMT和LLM的翻译方法，通过调度策略优化翻译结果，减少LLM的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在翻译任务中表现优异，但计算成本高且延迟大，而NMT系统在多数情况下表现相当。因此，需要一种方法结合两者优势。

Method: 提出了一种基于源句特征的调度策略，动态选择使用NMT或LLM进行翻译。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在最小化LLM使用的同时实现最优翻译性能。

Conclusion: 结合NMT和LLM的调度策略是高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) shows promising performances in a variety of
downstream tasks, such as machine translation (MT). However, using LLMs for
translation suffers from high computational costs and significant latency.
Based on our evaluation, in most cases, translations using LLMs are comparable
to that generated by neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Only in
particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a
result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when
necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes
translation result while ensuring fast speed and as little LLM usage as
possible is thereby required. We compare several scheduling policies and
propose a novel and straightforward decider that leverages source sentence
features. We conduct extensive experiments on multilingual test sets and the
result shows that we can achieve optimal translation performance with minimal
LLM usage, demonstrating effectiveness of our decider.

*Sathya Krishnan Suresh,Tanmay Surana,Lim Zhi Hao,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CS-Sum是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）对代码切换（CS）对话理解能力的基准测试，涵盖三种语言对，发现LLMs在自动指标得分高但仍存在语义错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs对CS对话的理解能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过CS-Sum基准测试，评估十种LLMs在少量样本、翻译-总结和微调方法下的表现。

Result: LLMs在自动指标上得分高，但存在语义错误，且错误类型和频率因语言对和模型而异。

Conclusion: 需针对CS数据进行专门训练，以提高LLMs对CS输入的理解能力。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet its comprehensibility remains underexplored in LLMs. We introduce
CS-Sum, to evaluate the comprehensibility of CS by the LLMs through CS dialogue
to English summarization. CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue
summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and
Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language
pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze
performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA
on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on
automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete
meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors
that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and
LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs,

TL;DR: 研究探讨视觉信息是否能替代双语文本实现多语言句子表征对齐，发现图像-标题对齐可隐式对齐语言表征，适用于低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖双语文本，但获取成本高；视觉信息提供更高效的低资源语言解决方案。

Method: 利用图像标题数据集，通过多语言图像-标题对齐隐式对齐语言表征。

Result: 未在预训练中见过的语言也能被纳入对齐，对齐表征可用于跨语言NLU和双语检索。

Conclusion: 视觉信息可作为双语文本的替代，高效实现多语言句子表征对齐。

Abstract: Multilingual alignment of sentence representations has mostly required
bitexts to bridge the gap between languages. We investigate whether visual
information can bridge this gap instead. Image caption datasets are very easy
to create without requiring multilingual expertise, so this offers a more
efficient alternative for low-resource languages. We find that multilingual
image-caption alignment can implicitly align the text representations between
languages, languages unseen by the encoder in pretraining can be incorporated
into this alignment post-hoc, and these aligned representations are usable for
cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and bitext retrieval.

*Charles J. Torres,Richard Futrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于算法信息理论的跨文字统一度量方法，通过正交和音系字符串的相互压缩性量化正字法透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏统一的、与文字无关的正字法透明度度量方法。

Method: 使用算法信息理论中的相互压缩性概念，结合神经序列模型的前序编码长度估计透明度。

Result: 评估22种语言，验证了不同文字类型透明度的直观认知。

Conclusion: 相互压缩性为衡量正字法透明度提供了简单、原则性强且通用的标准。

Abstract: Orthographic transparency -- how directly spelling is related to sound --
lacks a unified, script-agnostic metric. Using ideas from algorithmic
information theory, we quantify orthographic transparency in terms of the
mutual compressibility between orthographic and phonological strings. Our
measure provides a principled way to combine two factors that decrease
orthographic transparency, capturing both irregular spellings and rule
complexity in one quantity. We estimate our transparency measure using
prequential code-lengths derived from neural sequence models. Evaluating 22
languages across a broad range of script types (alphabetic, abjad, abugida,
syllabic, logographic) confirms common intuitions about relative transparency
of scripts. Mutual compressibility offers a simple, principled, and general
yardstick for orthographic transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在检测新闻文章中的宣传技术方面的表现，发现GPT-4优于GPT-3.5和Claude 3 Opus，但不及RoBERTa-CRF基线。部分宣传技术的检测中，LLMs表现优于多粒度网络（MGN）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别宣传技术对做出明智决策至关重要，NLP的进步为开发检测操纵性内容的系统提供了可能。

Method: 比较了多种大型语言模型（如GPT-4、GPT-3.5、Claude 3 Opus）与基于Transformer的模型（如RoBERTa-CRF）在检测宣传技术上的性能。

Result: GPT-4的F1分数（0.16）优于GPT-3.5和Claude 3 Opus，但不及RoBERTa-CRF基线（0.67）。部分宣传技术（如name-calling）的检测中，LLMs表现优于MGN基线。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4在部分任务中表现优异，但整体上仍不及特定设计的基线模型，表明LLMs在宣传技术检测领域仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Propagandists use rhetorical devices that rely on logical fallacies and
emotional appeals to advance their agendas. Recognizing these techniques is key
to making informed decisions. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) have enabled the development of systems capable of detecting manipulative
content. In this study, we look at several Large Language Models and their
performance in detecting propaganda techniques in news articles. We compare the
performance of these LLMs with transformer-based models. We find that, while
GPT-4 demonstrates superior F1 scores (F1=0.16) compared to GPT-3.5 and Claude
3 Opus, it does not outperform a RoBERTa-CRF baseline (F1=0.67). Additionally,
we find that all three LLMs outperform a MultiGranularity Network (MGN)
baseline in detecting instances of one out of six propaganda techniques
(name-calling), with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 also outperforming the MGN baseline in
detecting instances of appeal to fear and flag-waving.

Motivation: 现有开源模型在文本到SQL任务中与闭源模型存在性能差距，需要改进数据质量和多样性。

Method: 采用SQL语法约束和反向翻译确保数据可靠性，通过模板丰富和迭代探索提升数据多样性，并微调多种开源模型。

Result: SQLForge-LM在Spider和BIRD基准测试中达到开源模型的最优性能，分别为85.7%和59.8%的EX准确率。

Conclusion: SQLForge有效提升了开源模型的性能，缩小了与闭源模型的差距。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
text-to-SQL reasoning tasks, yet a substantial performance gap persists between
existing open-source models and their closed-source counterparts. In this
paper, we introduce SQLForge, a novel approach for synthesizing reliable and
diverse data to enhance text-to-SQL reasoning in LLMs. We improve data
reliability through SQL syntax constraints and SQL-to-question reverse
translation, ensuring data logic at both structural and semantic levels. We
also propose an SQL template enrichment and iterative data domain exploration
mechanism to boost data diversity. Building on the augmented data, we fine-tune
a variety of open-source models with different architectures and parameter
sizes, resulting in a family of models termed SQLForge-LM. SQLForge-LM achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on the widely recognized Spider and BIRD
benchmarks among the open-source models. Specifically, SQLForge-LM achieves EX
accuracy of 85.7% on Spider Dev and 59.8% on BIRD Dev, significantly narrowing
the performance gap with closed-source methods.

Motivation: 仿真模型复杂难用，而LLMs缺乏结构化理解，两者结合可互补优势。

Method: 开发仿真代理框架，整合仿真模型与LLMs，利用LLMs的对话能力与仿真的结构化建模。

Result: 框架提供了一种通用且稳健的方法，适用于多领域，支持经验验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂系统的交互建模提供了新思路，兼具易用性与准确性。

Abstract: Simulations, although powerful in accurately replicating real-world systems,
often remain inaccessible to non-technical users due to their complexity.
Conversely, large language models (LLMs) provide intuitive, language-based
interactions but can lack the structured, causal understanding required to
reliably model complex real-world dynamics. We introduce our simulation agent
framework, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both simulation
models and LLMs. This framework helps empower users by leveraging the
conversational capabilities of LLMs to interact seamlessly with sophisticated
simulation systems, while simultaneously utilizing the simulations to ground
the LLMs in accurate and structured representations of real-world phenomena.
This integrated approach helps provide a robust and generalizable foundation
for empirical validation and offers broad applicability across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在知识蒸馏（KD）中如何评估推理轨迹的忠实性及其与最终性能的关系，提出了一种基于规则的问题分解方法，并发现正确推理轨迹与最终答案正确性之间相关性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在交互式对话系统时代，用户对模型的准确性和透明性要求更高，而小型语言模型（SLM）效率高但性能不足。知识蒸馏方法通过推理轨迹提升性能，但这些轨迹难以评估。

Method: 采用基于规则的问题分解方法，将复杂查询拆解为结构化子问题，生成可解释的轨迹。在Open Book QA上验证，分解为分类和信息检索步骤。

Result: 实验表明，正确的推理轨迹不一定导致正确的最终答案，且两者相关性低。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了利用推理轨迹提升SLM性能的假设，揭示了其局限性。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem,
particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT,
Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and
transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are
computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger
models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller
models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or
the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by
reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD.
However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or
evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the
faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final
performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem
decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into
structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can
be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this
approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step
and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our
SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft
Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the
striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model
outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation
between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These
results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for
improving SLMs' final performance via KD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM参数和上下文窗口的增加，计算、能源和成本问题日益突出，亟需评估和优化效率技术。

Method: 在48xGH200和8xH200 GPU集群上，系统评估了架构预训练（如MQA、GQA、MoE）、微调（如LoRA、RSLoRA）和推理（如int4量化）的效率。

Result: 研究发现效率技术存在量化权衡，任务和规模依赖性，且技术可跨模态通用。

Conclusion: EfficientLLM为下一代基础模型的效率优化提供了重要指导，并开源了数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven significant progress, yet their
growing parameter counts and context windows incur prohibitive compute, energy,
and monetary costs. We introduce EfficientLLM, a novel benchmark and the first
comprehensive empirical study evaluating efficiency techniques for LLMs at
scale. Conducted on a production-class cluster (48xGH200, 8xH200 GPUs), our
study systematically explores three key axes: (1) architecture pretraining
(efficient attention variants: MQA, GQA, MLA, NSA; sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)), (2) fine-tuning (parameter-efficient methods: LoRA, RSLoRA, DoRA), and
(3) inference (quantization methods: int4, float16). We define six fine-grained
metrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy
Consumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation,
latency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100
model-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i)
Efficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally
optimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by
40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5%
accuracy drop. (ii) Optima are task- and scale-dependent: MQA offers optimal
memory-latency trade-offs for constrained devices, MLA achieves lowest
perplexity for quality-critical tasks, and RSLoRA surpasses LoRA efficiency
only beyond 14B parameters. (iii) Techniques generalize across modalities: we
extend evaluations to Large Vision Models (Stable Diffusion 3.5, Wan 2.1) and
Vision-Language Models (Qwen2.5-VL), confirming effective transferability. By
open-sourcing datasets, evaluation pipelines, and leaderboards, EfficientLLM
provides essential guidance for researchers and engineers navigating the
efficiency-performance landscape of next-generation foundation models.

Abstract: Associative memory engages in the integration of relevant information for
comprehension in the human cognition system. In this work, we seek to improve
alignment between language models and human brain while processing speech
information by integrating associative memory. After verifying the alignment
between language model and brain by mapping language model activations to brain
activity, the original text stimuli expanded with simulated associative memory
are regarded as input to computational language models. We find the alignment
between language model and brain is improved in brain regions closely related
to associative memory processing. We also demonstrate large language models
after specific supervised fine-tuning better align with brain response, by
building the \textit{Association} dataset containing 1000 samples of stories,
with instructions encouraging associative memory as input and associated
content as output.

Abstract: As state-of-the-art language models continue to improve, the need for robust
detection of machine-generated text becomes increasingly critical. However,
current state-of-the-art machine text detectors struggle to adapt to new unseen
domains and generative models. In this paper we present DoGEN (Domain Gating
Ensemble Networks), a technique that allows detectors to adapt to unseen
domains by ensembling a set of domain expert detector models using weights from
a domain classifier. We test DoGEN on a wide variety of domains from leading
benchmarks and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain
detection while outperforming models twice its size on out-of-domain detection.
We release our code and trained models to assist in future research in
domain-adaptive AI detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理密集型语言模型通过生成冗长的中间推理路径来提高准确性，但这增加了内存使用和生成延迟，限制了实际部署。

Method: RPC利用推理路径的语义稀疏性，定期压缩KV缓存，保留重要性高的部分。

Result: 实验显示，RPC将QwQ-32B的生成吞吐量提高了1.6倍，准确性仅下降1.2%。

Conclusion: RPC证明了推理路径的语义稀疏性可用于高效压缩，为推理LLM的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating
lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this
approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long
reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and throughput of token
generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose
Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates
inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC
periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high
importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of
recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation
throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full
KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our
findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be
effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward
efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at

Method: 通过大型语言模型（LLMs）适配游戏代码，自动获取推理过程和结果，生成GameQA数据集。

Result: GameQA数据集成本低、可扩展，且训练后的模型在跨领域任务中表现提升（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B性能提升2.33%）。

Conclusion: Code2Logic为视觉语言推理数据生成提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce
compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning
capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality
vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To
address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which
naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.
Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for
multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning
processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we
developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is
cost-effective and scalable to produce, challenging for state-of-the-art
models, and diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training
solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization,
specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33\% across 7 diverse

Conclusion: 该框架为推理质量评估和提示工程提供了新视角，并支持LLMs的认知分析。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have enabled Large Language Models
(LLMs) to display sophisticated reasoning abilities via extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation. Despite their potential, these Reasoning
LLMs (RLMs) often demonstrate counterintuitive and unstable behaviors, such as
performance degradation under few-shot prompting, that challenge our current
understanding of RLMs. In this work, we introduce a unified graph-based
analytical framework for better modeling the reasoning processes of RLMs. Our
method first clusters long, verbose CoT outputs into semantically coherent
reasoning steps, then constructs directed reasoning graphs to capture
contextual and logical dependencies among these steps. Through comprehensive
analysis across models and prompting regimes, we reveal that structural
properties, such as exploration density, branching, and convergence ratios,
strongly correlate with reasoning accuracy. Our findings demonstrate how
prompting strategies substantially reshape the internal reasoning structure of
RLMs, directly affecting task outcomes. The proposed framework not only enables
quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality beyond conventional metrics but
also provides practical insights for prompt engineering and the cognitive
analysis of LLMs. Code and resources will be released to facilitate future
research in this direction.

Result: 在11个基准测试中优于SOTA模型，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: InfiGFusion通过显式建模语义依赖，显著提升了异构模型融合的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified efforts to
fuse heterogeneous open-source models into a unified system that inherits their
complementary strengths. Existing logit-based fusion methods maintain inference
efficiency but treat vocabulary dimensions independently, overlooking semantic
dependencies encoded by cross-dimension interactions. These dependencies
reflect how token types interact under a model's internal reasoning and are
essential for aligning models with diverse generation behaviors. To explicitly
model these dependencies, we propose \textbf{InfiGFusion}, the first
structure-aware fusion framework with a novel \textit{Graph-on-Logits
Distillation} (GLD) loss. Specifically, we retain the top-$k$ logits per output
and aggregate their outer products across sequence positions to form a global
co-activation graph, where nodes represent vocabulary channels and edges
quantify their joint activations. To ensure scalability and efficiency, we
design a sorting-based closed-form approximation that reduces the original
$O(n^4)$ cost of Gromov-Wasserstein distance to $O(n \log n)$, with provable
approximation guarantees. Experiments across multiple fusion settings show that
GLD consistently improves fusion quality and stability. InfiGFusion outperforms
SOTA models and fusion baselines across 11 benchmarks spanning reasoning,
coding, and mathematics. It shows particular strength in complex reasoning
tasks, with +35.6 improvement on Multistep Arithmetic and +37.06 on Causal
Judgement over SFT, demonstrating superior multi-step and relational inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in
mathematical reasoning. To enable such capabilities, many existing works
distill strong reasoning models into long chains of thought or design
algorithms to construct high-quality math QA data for training. However, these
efforts primarily focus on generating correct reasoning paths and answers,
while largely overlooking the validity of the questions themselves. In this
work, we propose Math Question Verification (MathQ-Verify), a novel five-stage
pipeline designed to rigorously filter ill-posed or under-specified math
problems. MathQ-Verify first performs format-level validation to remove
redundant instructions and ensure that each question is syntactically
well-formed. It then formalizes each question, decomposes it into atomic
conditions, and verifies them against mathematical definitions. Next, it
detects logical contradictions among these conditions, followed by a
goal-oriented completeness check to ensure the question provides sufficient
information for solving. To evaluate this task, we use existing benchmarks
along with an additional dataset we construct, containing 2,147 math questions
with diverse error types, each manually double-validated. Experiments show that
MathQ-Verify achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks,
improving the F1 score by up to 25 percentage points over the direct
verification baseline. It further attains approximately 90% precision and 63%
recall through a lightweight model voting scheme. MathQ-Verify offers a
scalable and accurate solution for curating reliable mathematical datasets,
reducing label noise and avoiding unnecessary computation on invalid questions.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer has become a crucial aspect of multilingual NLP, as it
allows for models trained on resource-rich languages to be applied to
low-resource languages more effectively. Recently massively multilingual
pre-trained language models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) demonstrate strong zero-shot
transfer capabilities[14] [13]. This paper investigates cross-linguistic
transfer through the lens of language families and morphology. Investigating
how language family proximity and morphological similarity affect performance
across NLP tasks. We further discuss our results and how it relates to findings
from recent literature. Overall, we compare multilingual model performance and
review how linguistic distance metrics correlate with transfer outcomes. We
also look into emerging approaches that integrate typological and morphological
information into model pre-training to improve transfer to diverse
languages[18] [19].

*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大规模平行数据集的通用机制，解释词序变化，支持了语言演化的综合理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言中词序变化的起源机制，解决先天论与功能论的分歧。

Method: 使用超过1,500种语言的标记平行数据集，分析词类长度与词序的关系。

Result: 词类长度与词序显著相关，支持了处理和信息结构的竞争压力理论。

Conclusion: 提出"Min-Max"理论，整合处理效率与信息结构，解释语言演化。

Abstract: Current theories of language propose an innate (Baker 2001; Chomsky 1981) or
a functional (Greenberg 1963; Dryer 2007; Hawkins 2014) origin for the surface
structures (i.e. word order) that we observe in languages of the world, while
evolutionary modeling (Dunn et al. 2011) suggests that descent is the primary
factor influencing such patterns. Although there are hypotheses for word order
change from both innate and usage-based perspectives for specific languages and
families, there are key disagreements between the two major proposals for
mechanisms that drive the evolution of language more broadly (Wasow 2002; Levy
2008). This paper proposes a universal underlying mechanism for word order
change based on a large tagged parallel dataset of over 1,500 languages
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates. Results indicate that word
class length is significantly correlated with word order crosslinguistically,
but not in a straightforward manner, partially supporting opposing theories of
processing, while at the same time predicting historical word order change in
two different phylogenetic lines and explaining more variance than descent or
language area in regression models. Such findings suggest an integrated
"Min-Max" theory of language evolution driven by competing pressures of
processing and information structure, aligning with recent efficiency-oriented
(Levshina 2023) and information-theoretic proposals (Zaslavsky 2020; Tucker et
al. 2025).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EEG信号解码模型性能不足的问题，提升EEG到文本的转换质量。

Method: 采用双向LSTM编码器捕捉EEG信号的时序依赖，结合预训练Transformer解码器生成高质量文本。

Result: 在ROUGE-1、ROUGE-L、CER和WER指标上均优于T5和Brain Translator模型。

Conclusion: R1 Translator模型在EEG到文本解码任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and
others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has
become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have
developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models
still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of
EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM
encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to
produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through
the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the
transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in
ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator.
Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9%
higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in
ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain
by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower
than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs
better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and
Brain by 3.6% (0.7553). Code is available at

TL;DR: WAVE++提出了一种基于提示的新方法，通过任务特定提示池和标签描述改进持续关系抽取，解决了任务识别和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在持续关系抽取中面临任务识别不准确和遗忘问题，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 引入任务特定提示池和标签描述，结合生成模型整合先验知识，无需显式存储数据。

Result: WAVE++在实验中优于现有基于提示和基于记忆的方法。

Conclusion: WAVE++为持续关系抽取提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Memory-based approaches have shown strong performance in Continual Relation
Extraction (CRE). However, storing examples from previous tasks increases
memory usage and raises privacy concerns. Recently, prompt-based methods have
emerged as a promising alternative, as they do not rely on storing past
samples. Despite this progress, current prompt-based techniques face several
core challenges in CRE, particularly in accurately identifying task identities
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing prompt selection strategies
often suffer from inaccuracies, lack robust mechanisms to prevent forgetting in
shared parameters, and struggle to handle both cross-task and within-task
variations. In this paper, we propose WAVE++, a novel approach inspired by the
connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts. Specifically, we
introduce task-specific prompt pools that enhance flexibility and adaptability
across diverse tasks while avoiding boundary-spanning risks; this design more
effectively captures variations within each task and across tasks. To further
refine relation classification, we incorporate label descriptions that provide
richer, more global context, enabling the model to better distinguish among
different relations. We also propose a training-free mechanism to improve task
prediction during inference. Moreover, we integrate a generative model to
consolidate prior knowledge within the shared parameters, thereby removing the
need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WAVE++
outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-based methods, offering
a more robust solution for continual relation extraction. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种以记忆为中心的EQA框架MemoryEQA，通过多模态分层记忆机制提升复杂任务的处理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA框架以规划器为中心，记忆模块无法与其他模块充分交互，限制了处理复杂任务的能力。

Method: 提出MemoryEQA框架，采用全局和局部记忆分层机制，并利用多模态大语言模型转换记忆信息以适应不同模块输入。

Result: 在HM-EQA、MT-HM3D和OpenEQA数据集上验证了框架的有效性，MT-HM3D上性能提升19.8%。

Conclusion: 记忆能力在解决复杂EQA任务中起关键作用，MemoryEQA框架显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to autonomously explore and
understand the environment to answer context-dependent questions. Existing
frameworks typically center around the planner, which guides the stopping
module, memory module, and answering module for reasoning. In this paper, we
propose a memory-centric EQA framework named MemoryEQA. Unlike planner-centric
EQA models where the memory module cannot fully interact with other modules,
MemoryEQA flexible feeds memory information into all modules, thereby enhancing
efficiency and accuracy in handling complex tasks, such as those involving
multiple targets across different regions. Specifically, we establish a
multi-modal hierarchical memory mechanism, which is divided into global memory
that stores language-enhanced scene maps, and local memory that retains
historical observations and state information. When performing EQA tasks, the
multi-modal large language model is leveraged to convert memory information
into the required input formats for injection into different modules. To
evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the MT-HM3D dataset
based on HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple
targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of
exploration-acquired target information. Experimental results on HM-EQA,
MT-HM3D, and OpenEQA demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, where a
19.8% performance gain on MT-HM3D compared to baseline model further
underscores memory capability's pivotal role in resolving complex tasks.

*Guochao Jiang,Guofeng Quan,Zepeng Ding,Ziqin Luo,Dixuan Wang,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FlashThink的方法，通过验证模型提前终止大语言模型（LLMs）的推理过程，显著减少推理内容的长度，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现优异，但常生成冗长的推理内容，导致计算资源浪费。实验表明，模型在推理过程中可能已具备生成正确答案的能力，无需完成全部推理。

Method: 引入验证模型，识别模型可以停止推理但仍能提供正确答案的时刻。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，FlashThink将推理内容长度减少了77.04%和77.47%（分别针对Deepseek-R1和QwQ-32B模型），且未降低准确性。

Conclusion: FlashThink方法有效实现了高效推理，减少了不必要的计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in reasoning
tasks. However, LLMs tend to generate excessively long reasoning content,
leading to significant computational overhead. Our observations indicate that
even on simple problems, LLMs tend to produce unnecessarily lengthy reasoning
content, which is against intuitive expectations. Preliminary experiments show
that at a certain point during the generation process, the model is already
capable of producing the correct solution without completing the full reasoning
content. Therefore, we consider that the reasoning process of the model can be
exited early to achieve the purpose of efficient reasoning. We introduce a
verification model that identifies the exact moment when the model can stop
reasoning and still provide the correct answer. Comprehensive experiments on
four different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method, FlashThink,
effectively shortens the reasoning content while preserving the model accuracy.
For the Deepseek-R1 and QwQ-32B models, we reduced the length of reasoning
content by 77.04% and 77.47%, respectively, without reducing the accuracy.

TL;DR: 量化方法对大型语言模型（LLM）的解释性和可解释性有显著影响，效果因量化方法、解释方法及评估协议而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化方法广泛用于加速LLM推理，但其对模型解释性和可理解性的影响尚未研究，这对理解决策过程至关重要。

Method: 使用三种量化技术和两种解释性方法（反事实示例和自然语言解释）及两种可解释性方法（知识记忆分析和潜在多跳推理分析）进行实验，辅以用户研究。

Result: 量化对解释性和可解释性的影响不一致，可能恶化或改善，取决于量化方法、解释方法和评估协议。

Conclusion: 量化可能不可预测地影响模型透明度，对需要透明度的LLM应用具有重要启示。

Abstract: Quantization methods are widely used to accelerate inference and streamline
the deployment of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has
extensively investigated the degradation of various LLM capabilities due to
quantization, its effects on model explainability and interpretability, which
are crucial for understanding decision-making processes, remain unexplored. To
address this gap, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three common
quantization techniques at distinct bit widths, in conjunction with two
explainability methods, counterfactual examples and natural language
explanations, as well as two interpretability approaches, knowledge
memorization analysis and latent multi-hop reasoning analysis. We complement
our analysis with a thorough user study, evaluating selected explainability
methods. Our findings reveal that, depending on the configuration, quantization
can significantly impact model explainability and interpretability. Notably,
the direction of this effect is not consistent, as it strongly depends on (1)
the quantization method, (2) the explainability or interpretability approach,
and (3) the evaluation protocol. In some settings, human evaluation shows that
quantization degrades explainability, while in others, it even leads to
improvements. Our work serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating that
quantization can unpredictably affect model transparency. This insight has
important implications for deploying LLMs in applications where transparency is
a critical requirement.

TL;DR: CAFES是一个多智能体协作框架，用于提升自动化作文评分（AES）的泛化性和多模态感知能力，显著提高了评分与人类判断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AES方法在泛化性和多模态感知方面表现不佳，而现有的MLLM方法可能产生幻觉性评分。CAFES旨在解决这些问题。

Method: CAFES通过三个智能体协作：初始评分器、反馈池管理器和反思评分器，迭代优化评分。

Result: 实验显示，CAFES在QWK指标上相对提升了21%，尤其在语法和词汇多样性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CAFES为智能多模态AES系统奠定了基础，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is crucial for modern education, particularly
with the increasing prevalence of multimodal assessments. However, traditional
AES methods struggle with evaluation generalizability and multimodal
perception, while even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based
approaches can produce hallucinated justifications and scores misaligned with
human judgment. To address the limitations, we introduce CAFES, the first
collaborative multi-agent framework specifically designed for AES. It
orchestrates three specialized agents: an Initial Scorer for rapid,
trait-specific evaluations; a Feedback Pool Manager to aggregate detailed,
evidence-grounded strengths; and a Reflective Scorer that iteratively refines
scores based on this feedback to enhance human alignment. Extensive
experiments, using state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieve an average relative
improvement of 21% in Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) against ground truth,
especially for grammatical and lexical diversity. Our proposed CAFES framework
paves the way for an intelligent multimodal AES system. The code will be
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在反事实数据增强（CDA）中，选择独立且未经微调的评估模型能提供最可靠的标签翻转评估，但自动化流程仍需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨评估模型的选择对反事实数据增强（CDA）中标签翻转评估的影响，以提高大型语言模型（LLMs）的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过实验分析四种生成模型与评估模型的关系，涉及两种先进LLM方法、三个数据集、五个生成模型和15个评估模型，并辅以用户研究（n=90）。

Result: 独立且未经微调的评估模型表现最佳，但自动化流程与用户研究结果仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 完全自动化的CDA流程可能不足，需结合人工干预。

Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and
robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data
augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate
label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated
counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we
define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and
judge models. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art
LLM-based methods, three datasets, five generator models, and 15 judge models,
complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an
independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the
most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator
and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result
in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap
between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user
study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline
for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

Method: 分析了四个关键维度：基础模型初始化策略、医学语义对齐的作用、长度奖励对长链推理的影响以及偏差的影响。

Result: 实验表明，基于GRPO的RL调优在准确性和推理质量上均优于标准监督微调（SFT）。

Conclusion: 研究为医学MLLMs的领域特定调优提供了新见解，并验证了GRPO在医学任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based tuning has shifted the trajectory
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly following the
introduction of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, directly
applying it to medical tasks remains challenging for achieving clinically
grounded model behavior. Motivated by the need to align model response with
clinical expectations, we investigate four critical dimensions that affect the
effectiveness of RL-based tuning in medical visual question answering (VQA):
base model initialization strategy, the role of medical semantic alignment, the
impact of length-based rewards on long-chain reasoning, and the influence of
bias. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze these factors for medical
MLLMs, providing new insights into how models are domain-specifically
fine-tuned. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that GRPO-based RL
tuning consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both
accuracy and reasoning quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但其推理过程冗长且低效，需要优化。

Method: DRP结合推理时剪枝和基于调优的蒸馏技术，利用教师模型进行技能感知的步骤分解和内容剪枝，并将剪枝后的推理路径蒸馏到学生模型中。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集上，DRP显著减少令牌使用（如GSM8K从917降至328），同时提高准确性（从91.7%到94.1%）。

Conclusion: DRP通过优化推理结构和知识转移，实现了高效且准确的推理，证明了推理结构与模型能力对齐的重要性。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated success in complex
reasoning tasks through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, their inference
often involves excessively verbose reasoning traces, resulting in substantial
inefficiency. To address this, we propose Distilled Reasoning Pruning (DRP), a
hybrid framework that combines inference-time pruning with tuning-based
distillation, two widely used strategies for efficient reasoning. DRP uses a
teacher model to perform skill-aware step decomposition and content pruning,
and then distills the pruned reasoning paths into a student model, enabling it
to reason both efficiently and accurately. Across several challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve
substantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while
improving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on
AIME with no performance drop. Further analysis shows that aligning the
reasoning structure of training CoTs with the student's reasoning capacity is
critical for effective knowledge transfer and performance gains.

Motivation: 探究多模态模型在共情检测中因模态冲突导致性能下降的原因。

Method: 使用文本、音频和视频的微调模型及门控融合模型，分析单模态与多模态预测的分歧。

Result: 分歧常反映潜在模糊性，主导模态信号可能误导融合；人类与模型在多模态输入中表现不一致。

Conclusion: 分歧可作为诊断信号，提升共情系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance
can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these
failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge.
Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion
model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as
evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in
one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe
that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input.
These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for
identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.

Conclusion: 结合SUM数据的RFT能有效提升模型对不确定性和知识边界的识别能力，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has become a standard approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its impact
on model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and
systematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the
hallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce
hallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate
this, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of
unanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an
unanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous
information. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model
refusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency
to hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during
RFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy
trade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage
inference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge
boundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems
but also to factual question answering tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部资源生成指令数据，限制了灵活性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明DecIF在指令跟随任务中表现优异，具有灵活性、可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DecIF能自动生成高质量指令数据，为LLMs的指令跟随能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-following has emerged as a crucial capability for large language
models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on pre-existing
documents or external resources to synthesize instruction-following data, which
limits their flexibility and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce
DecIF, a fully autonomous, meta-decomposition guided framework that generates
diverse and high-quality instruction-following data using only LLMs. DecIF is
grounded in the principle of decomposition. For instruction generation, we
guide LLMs to iteratively produce various types of meta-information, which are
then combined with response constraints to form well-structured and
semantically rich instructions. We further utilize LLMs to detect and resolve
potential inconsistencies within the generated instructions. Regarding response
generation, we decompose each instruction into atomic-level evaluation
criteria, enabling rigorous validation and the elimination of inaccurate
instruction-response pairs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
scenarios and settings demonstrate DecIF's superior performance on
instruction-following tasks. Further analysis highlights its strong
flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in automatically synthesizing
high-quality instruction data.

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注明确可验证的谄媚行为，忽略了模糊情境中的谄媚问题，如建议和支持寻求场景。

Method: 提出社交谄媚理论，开发ELEPHANT框架，评估五种面子保全行为，使用OEQ和AITA数据集测试八个模型。

Result: LLMs在社交谄媚方面表现显著，OEQ中比人类多47%，AITA中42%的情况下支持不当行为。

Conclusion: 社交谄媚在偏好数据集中被奖励且难以缓解，研究提供了理论支持和实证工具以解决这一问题。

Abstract: A serious risk to the safety and utility of LLMs is sycophancy, i.e.,
excessive agreement with and flattery of the user. Yet existing work focuses on
only one aspect of sycophancy: agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs
that can be compared to a ground truth. This overlooks forms of sycophancy that
arise in ambiguous contexts such as advice and support-seeking, where there is
no clear ground truth, yet sycophancy can reinforce harmful implicit
assumptions, beliefs, or actions. To address this gap, we introduce a richer
theory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive
preservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to
maintain in an interaction). We present ELEPHANT, a framework for evaluating
social sycophancy across five face-preserving behaviors (emotional validation,
moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing)
on two datasets: open-ended questions (OEQ) and Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole
(AITA). Across eight models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates
of social sycophancy: on OEQ, they preserve face 47% more than humans, and on
AITA, they affirm behavior deemed inappropriate by crowdsourced human judgments
in 42% of cases. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in
preference datasets and is not easily mitigated. Our work provides theoretical
grounding and empirical tools (datasets and code) for understanding and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于激活引导的共识合并（ACM）方法，用于高效整合不同大型语言模型的能力，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法通常假设各层重要性相同，忽略了神经组件的功能异质性，导致效率与稳定性问题。

Method: ACM通过预训练和微调模型激活间的互信息确定层特定合并系数，保留任务特定能力。

Result: 在L2S和通用合并任务中，ACM表现优于基线方法，例如在Qwen-7B模型上，响应长度减少55.3%，推理准确率提高1.3分。

Conclusion: ACM是一种即插即用的高效合并框架，显著提升了模型合并的性能。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning
capabilities of System 2 with the efficiency of System 1. While existing
training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms
of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to
integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs)
into a unified model. However, conventional model merging methods often assume
uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity
inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}),
a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging
coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and
fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without
requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments
on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM
consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of
Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%}
reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy
by \textbf{1.3} points. We submit the code with the paper for reproducibility,
and it will be publicly available.

*Tai D. Nguyen,Long H. Pham,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLaw是一个结合对抗数据生成和陪审团式审议过程的框架，旨在提升领域特定大语言模型（LLMs）的法律合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律评估基准缺乏适应性，无法应对多样化的本地法律环境，限制了其在动态监管环境中的实用性。

Method: AutoLaw通过动态合成案例法反映地方法规，并利用基于LLM的“陪审员”模拟司法决策，减少偏见并提高检测准确性。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AutoLaw表现出色：对抗数据生成提高了LLM的辨别能力，陪审团投票策略显著提升了违规检测率。

Conclusion: AutoLaw能够自适应地探测法律偏差并提供可靠的上下文感知判断，为法律敏感应用中的LLM评估和增强提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in
fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal
distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to
address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving
regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel
violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a
jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike
static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local
regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial
decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal
expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves
detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG
(legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness:
adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based
voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results
highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and
deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for
evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

Motivation: 现有的大规模多语言数据未对齐，限制了跨语言语义的捕捉能力，而多语言平行数据能提供更强的跨语言一致性。

Method: 构建了TED2025语料库，涵盖113种语言，最多50种语言平行对齐，并研究了继续预训练和指令调优的最佳实践。

Result: 实验表明，在多语言基准测试中，基于平行数据训练的模型性能优于未对齐数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 多语言平行数据能有效提升大语言模型的多语言性能。

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data
have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to
low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its
ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way
parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages,
provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for
improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale,
high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus
spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring
extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best
practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including
strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of
key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that
models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained
on unaligned multilingual data.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法常导致性能显著下降或需要大量重新训练，目标是获得更小、更快的知识蒸馏模型。

Method: 基于预训练阶段的权重和偏置，结合GRPO奖励作为剪枝指标。

Result: 在极端剪枝水平下仍保持与原模型相当的性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAMA Pruning是一种高效且性能优越的剪枝方法。

Abstract: Model pruning is a performance optimization technique for large language
models like R1 or o3-mini. However, existing pruning methods often lead to
significant performance degradation or require extensive retraining and
fine-tuning. This technique aims to identify and remove neurons, connections
unlikely leading to the contribution during the human-computer interaction
phase. Our goal is to obtain a much smaller and faster knowledge distilled
model that can quickly generate content almost as good as those of the unpruned
ones. We propose MAMA Pruning, short for Movement and Magnitude Analysis, an
improved pruning method that effectively reduces model size and computational
complexity while maintaining performance comparable to the original unpruned
model even at extreme pruned levels. The improved method is based on weights,
bias fixed in the pre-training phase and GRPO rewards verified during the
post-training phase as our novel pruning indicators. Preliminary experimental
results show that our method outperforms and be comparable to state-of-the-art
methods across various pruning levels and different downstream computational
linguistics tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识丰富度的高质量数据选择方法（HKS），通过知识密度和覆盖率评估文本，提升模型在知识密集任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法未充分考虑知识丰富度，导致预训练语料中知识稀缺问题。

Method: 提出梯度无关的高知识评分器（HKS），结合多领域知识元素池，以知识密度和覆盖率为指标选择高质量数据。

Result: 实验表明，HKS能提升模型在知识密集和通用理解任务中的表现，增强通用及领域特定能力。

Conclusion: HKS为数据选择提供了新视角，有效解决知识稀缺问题并提升模型性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to
the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed
methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of
knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and
gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the
dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the
pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element
pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the
knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive
knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be
utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting
knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge
bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer
improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general
comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and
domain-specific capabilities of the model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于逆向推理的BAR代理，用于解决复杂任务规划问题，通过从目标状态出发分解任务，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正向推理的规划方法在复杂任务中表现不佳，作者认为这是由于初始状态与目标状态间的感知差距较大。

Method: 设计了BAR代理，包含递归目标分解、状态一致性维护和阶段记忆模块，支持从终端状态开始的稳健规划。

Result: 实验结果表明BAR在复杂任务中优于现有方法，验证了模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 逆向推理能有效解决复杂任务规划问题，BAR的设计为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in
following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To
complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by
planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps
should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this
forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to
study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex
tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward
reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state
and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the
planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task
goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent
(BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state
consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust,
consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods
and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型如何编码和延续有害的性别刻板印象，提出需超越表面关联，关注性别建构本身，并实证分析了16种模型，发现性别被编码为二元且与生物性别绑定，呼吁重新定义和解决性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅通过解耦性别与非性别词汇来缓解偏见，但性别建构本身（如将性别与生物性别混为一谈）可能导致更多危害，如跨性别者身份被抹除。

Method: 结合性别研究理论，实证测试16种不同架构、数据集和规模的模型，分析其性别编码方式。

Result: 模型倾向于将性别编码为二元且与生物性别绑定，非二元性别词汇被抹除或病理化，且模型规模越大，性别与生物性别关联越强。

Conclusion: 需重新定义语言模型中的性别偏见，并采取更全面的方法解决性别建构带来的危害。

Abstract: Language models encode and subsequently perpetuate harmful gendered
stereotypes. Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by
dissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as
'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that
associations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise.
Critical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory,
emphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such
as conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues
could lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and
cause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to
misdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.
  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic
associations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language
models. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through
language from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16
language models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes
encode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary
category tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly
fall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally,
we show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance
benchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further
reinforcing a narrow understanding of gender. Our findings lead us to call for
a re-evaluation of how gendered harms in language models are defined and
addressed.

TL;DR: PDRR框架通过预测、分解、检索和推理四阶段，结合知识库和LLM，显著提升KBQA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM-only方法的过时知识、幻觉和透明度问题，以及链式KG-RAG方法对复杂问题的局限性。

Method: 提出PDRR框架：预测问题类型、分解为结构化三元组、检索相关知识、指导LLM推理完成三元组。

Result: PDRR在不同LLM骨干上均优于现有方法，尤其在非链式复杂问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: PDRR通过结构化规划和逻辑推理，有效解决了KBQA中的复杂问题处理难题。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using structured knowledge from KBs. While LLM-only approaches offer
generalization, they suffer from outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and lack
of transparency. Chain-based KG-RAG methods address these issues by
incorporating external KBs, but are limited to simple chain-structured
questions due to the absence of planning and logical structuring. Inspired by
semantic parsing methods, we propose PDRR: a four-stage framework consisting of
Predict, Decompose, Retrieve, and Reason. Our method first predicts the
question type and decomposes the question into structured triples. Then
retrieves relevant information from KBs and guides the LLM as an agent to
reason over and complete the decomposed triples. Experimental results
demonstrate that PDRR consistently outperforms existing methods across various
LLM backbones and achieves superior performance on both chain-structured and
non-chain complex questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的多语言、多跳基准测试MultiHal，用于评估生成文本的事实性，弥补了现有基准测试在KG路径和多语言支持上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）存在事实性和忠实性问题（幻觉），现有基准测试主要依赖英语数据集和补充上下文，忽略了结构化事实资源（如知识图谱）。

Method: 通过挖掘开放领域KG中的路径（140k条），筛选出高质量子集（25.9k条），构建MultiHal基准测试，并评估KG-RAG在多种语言和模型中的表现。

Result: 基线评估显示，KG-RAG在语义相似度得分上比普通QA提高了0.12到0.36分，证明了KG集成的潜力。

Conclusion: MultiHal有望推动基于图谱的幻觉缓解和事实核查任务的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and
factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have
been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the
context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative
context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured
factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as
a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to
represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic
overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual
language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and
propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called \textbf{MultiHal}
framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline,
we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy
KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation
shows an absolute scale increase by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the
semantic similarity score in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages
and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We
anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based
hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算法律研究在从司法判决中归纳法律规则方面研究不足，LLMs的出现为此提供了新机会，但缺乏正式任务定义和基准数据集。

Method: 论文将LRI任务形式化，构建了包含5,121个案例集和216个专家标注测试集的基准数据集，并评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验显示，现有LLMs在LRI任务中存在过度泛化和幻觉问题，但通过训练可显著提升其能力。

Conclusion: 论文填补了法律规则归纳研究的空白，为未来研究提供了基准和方法支持。

Abstract: Legal rules encompass not only codified statutes but also implicit
adjudicatory principles derived from precedents that contain discretionary
norms, social morality, and policy. While computational legal research has
advanced in applying established rules to cases, inducing legal rules from
judicial decisions remains understudied, constrained by limitations in model
inference efficacy and symbolic reasoning capability. The advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for automating the
extraction of such latent principles, yet progress is stymied by the absence of
formal task definitions, benchmark datasets, and methodologies. To address this
gap, we formalize Legal Rule Induction (LRI) as the task of deriving concise,
generalizable doctrinal rules from sets of analogous precedents, distilling
their shared preconditions, normative behaviors, and legal consequences. We
introduce the first LRI benchmark, comprising 5,121 case sets (38,088 Chinese
cases in total) for model tuning and 216 expert-annotated gold test sets.
Experimental results reveal that: 1) State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with
over-generalization and hallucination; 2) Training on our dataset markedly
enhances LLMs capabilities in capturing nuanced rule patterns across similar
cases.

Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large

personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench
integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact
regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based
domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized
conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We
benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting
setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial
performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best
non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing
PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs
that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce
contextually rich, engaging responses.

Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing
complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various
scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios.
To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare
settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of
current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical
benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present
DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to
rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena
consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses,
spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published
in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a
meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and
review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to
prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning
models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79%
accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization
bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic
reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further
advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective
solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges. We provide the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Logit的LLM水印方法在低熵场景下效果不佳，且依赖原始LLM导致高成本和潜在模型泄漏风险。

Method: 引入轻量级特征提取器和熵标记器预测高低熵令牌，并结合理论分析开发自适应熵阈值导航器。

Result: 在HumanEval和MBPP数据集上，IE将参数量减少99%，性能与现有最优方法相当。

Conclusion: IE为低熵水印提供了一种安全高效的范式。

Abstract: Logit-based LLM watermarking traces and verifies AI-generated content by
maintaining green and red token lists and increasing the likelihood of green
tokens during generation. However, it fails in low-entropy scenarios, where
predictable outputs make green token selection difficult without disrupting
natural text flow. Existing approaches address this by assuming access to the
original LLM to calculate entropy and selectively watermark high-entropy
tokens. However, these methods face two major challenges: (1) high
computational costs and detection delays due to reliance on the original LLM,
and (2) potential risks of model leakage. To address these limitations, we
propose Invisible Entropy (IE), a watermarking paradigm designed to enhance
both safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on the original LLM, IE
introduces a lightweight feature extractor and an entropy tagger to predict
whether the entropy of the next token is high or low. Furthermore, based on
theoretical analysis, we develop a threshold navigator that adaptively sets
entropy thresholds. It identifies a threshold where the watermark ratio
decreases as the green token count increases, enhancing the naturalness of the
watermarked text and improving detection robustness. Experiments on HumanEval
and MBPP datasets demonstrate that IE reduces parameter size by 99\% while
achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our work introduces
a safe and efficient paradigm for low-entropy watermarking.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法需要人工创建长思维链数据，难度大且成本高。SRLM旨在通过模型自身生成和优化推理数据，减少人工干预。

Method: SRLM利用少量示例（1,000个样本）作为推理催化剂，模型自我合成更长CoT数据并通过迭代训练提升性能。

Result: 在五个推理任务（MMLU、GSM8K、ARC-C、HellaSwag、BBH）上平均提升2.5分，采样64次时提升达7.89分。

Conclusion: SRLM展示了通过自我训练生成多样化推理路径的潜力，为复杂推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has attracted much attention which significantly
enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning
tasks by increasing the length of Chain-of-Thought. These longer intermediate
reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition,
such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In
this work, we introduce \textit{Self-Reasoning Language Model} (SRLM), where
the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve
performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration
examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from
existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM
not only enhances the model's initial performance but also ensures more stable
and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM
achieves an average absolute improvement of more than $+2.5$ points across five
reasoning tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH on two backbone models.
Moreover, it brings more improvements with more times of sampling during
inference, such as absolute $+7.89$ average improvement with $64$ sampling
times, revealing the in-depth, diverse and creative reasoning paths in SRLM
against the strong baseline.

Method: 通过组合目标词、层数及大小写模型，评估其对868个标准复合词组合性的预测能力。

Result: 德语BERT在早期层中能较好捕捉组合性信息，但整体表现明显落后于英语BERT。

Conclusion: 德语名词复合词语义编码任务比英语更具挑战性，可能源于更高的生产力和歧义性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which pretrained German BERT encodes
knowledge of noun compound semantics. We comprehensively vary combinations of
target tokens, layers, and cased vs. uncased models, and evaluate them by
predicting the compositionality of 868 gold standard compounds. Looking at
representational patterns within the transformer architecture, we observe
trends comparable to equivalent prior work on English, with compositionality
information most easily recoverable in the early layers. However, our strongest
results clearly lag behind those reported for English, suggesting an inherently
more difficult task in German. This may be due to the higher productivity of
compounding in German than in English and the associated increase in
constituent-level ambiguity, including in our target compound set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对表格表示（文本或图像）与模型组合效果的细致比较，限制了方法的优化。

Method: 构建新基准，系统分析七对多模态大模型（MLLMs）与大语言模型（LLMs）的组合效果，提出动态选择方法FRES。

Result: 最佳组合因问题复杂度和表格大小而异，FRES方法平均性能提升10%。

Conclusion: 动态选择表格表示能显著提升性能，未来可进一步优化组合策略。

Abstract: In table question answering (TQA), tables are encoded as either texts or
images. Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to or even better than using
textual input with large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
controlled setups limits fine-grained distinctions between these approaches. In
this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of
several combinations of table representations and models from two perspectives:
question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing
TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we
find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across
setups. We propose FRES, a method selecting table representations dynamically,
and observe a 10% average performance improvement compared to using both
representations indiscriminately.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用学术文章的结构特征和章节文本改进关键词提取（KPE）性能的方法，通过整合章节提取结果和结构特征，显著提升了KPE效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术论文数量的激增增加了研究者获取相关文献的时间，关键词提取（KPE）能帮助高效检索文献，但现有方法因摘要长度限制或全文噪声问题效果不佳。

Method: 研究分为两部分：(1) 分析七种结构特征对KPE模型的影响，(2) 通过关键词整合算法整合各章节文本的提取结果。同时研究了章节结构分类质量对KPE的影响。

Result: 结构特征的引入提升了KPE性能，不同特征效果各异；关键词整合方法表现最佳，章节结构分类质量影响KPE效果。

Conclusion: 利用学术文章的章节结构信息能有效提升关键词提取性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The exponential increase in academic papers has significantly increased the
time required for researchers to access relevant literature. Keyphrase
Extraction (KPE) offers a solution to this situation by enabling researchers to
efficiently retrieve relevant literature. The current study on KPE from
academic articles aims to improve the performance of extraction models through
innovative approaches using Title and Abstract as input corpora. However, the
semantic richness of keywords is significantly constrained by the length of the
abstract. While full-text-based KPE can address this issue, it simultaneously
introduces noise, which significantly diminishes KPE performance. To address
this issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts
obtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract
keyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1)
exploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2)
integrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora
for KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase
integration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the
classification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results
show that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though
different features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase
integration approach yields the best performance, and the classification
quality of section structure can affect KPE performance. These findings
indicate that using the section structure information of academic articles
contributes to effective KPE from academic articles. The code and dataset
supporting this study are available at https://github.com/yan-xinyi/SSB_KPE.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在强化微调（RFT）中先验提示工程（pPE）的作用，发现不同pPE方法能引导语言模型（LM）内化不同行为，其中null-example方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RFT研究多关注算法、奖励塑造和数据整理，而先验提示设计的作用未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将五种推理时提示工程（iPE）策略转化为pPE方法，并在Qwen2.5-7B上进行实验，评估其在多个基准测试中的表现。

Result: 所有pPE训练模型均优于iPE提示模型，null-example方法表现最佳，且在AIME2024和GPQA-Diamond上提升最大。

Conclusion: pPE是RFT中一个强大但未被充分研究的维度，不同pPE策略能塑造模型的不同行为风格。

Abstract: This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized
to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While
existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and
data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to
queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE
approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired
by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative
iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall,
and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment
with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and
GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their
iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the
largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and
GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by
adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE
strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These
findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过激活工程技术使大语言模型（LLMs）在时间上对齐，以提升事实回忆能力，无需训练或数据集创建。实验显示，该方法在相对和显式提示下分别提升44%和16%，性能接近微调方法，但计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs生成时间上准确的回答对维持相关性和准确性至关重要，尤其是涉及特定时间背景的问题。

Method: 采用激活工程技术，将三个版本的LLaMA 2模型对齐到特定时间点，研究不同注入层和提示策略的效果。

Result: 实验表明，相对提示和显式提示分别提升44%和16%，性能与微调方法相当，但计算效率更高且无需预对齐数据集。

Conclusion: 激活工程技术是一种高效且无需训练的方法，可显著提升LLMs的时间对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on diverse and often conflicting
knowledge spanning multiple domains and time periods. Some of this knowledge is
only valid within specific temporal contexts, such as answering the question,
"Who is the President of the United States in 2022?" Ensuring LLMs generate
time appropriate responses is crucial for maintaining relevance and accuracy.
In this work we explore activation engineering as a method for temporally
aligning LLMs to improve factual recall without any training or dataset
creation. In this research we explore an activation engineering technique to
ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the
effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments
demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting
respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method
proposed by Zhao et al. (2024) . Notably, our approach achieves similar results
to the fine-tuning baseline while being significantly more computationally
efficient and requiring no pre-aligned datasets.

TL;DR: 多语言视觉语言模型在图像-文本检索中表现出社会偏见，研究发现多语言性并未缓解偏见，反而在某些情况下加剧了性别和种族偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言视觉语言模型的社会偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 对三种多语言CLIP模型（M-CLIP、NLLB-CLIP、CAPIVARA-CLIP）在十种语言中进行系统性审计，使用平衡数据集评估种族和性别偏见。

Result: 所有模型在多语言环境中表现出比单语言基线更强的性别偏见，低资源语言和性别中性语言尤其受影响。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进行细粒度、语言感知的偏见评估，避免跨语言权重共享带来的偏见转移。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models promise universal image-text retrieval,
yet their social biases remain under-explored. We present the first systematic
audit of three public multilingual CLIP checkpoints -- M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, and
CAPIVARA-CLIP -- across ten languages that vary in resource availability and
grammatical gender. Using balanced subsets of \textsc{FairFace} and the
\textsc{PATA} stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and
gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the assumption
that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender bias
than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases
precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared
cross-lingual encoder of NLLB-CLIP transports English gender stereotypes into
gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this transfer.
Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all measured bias types, but
even gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable when cross-lingual weight
sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics conceal
language-specific ``hot spots,'' underscoring the need for fine-grained,
language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual vision-language research.

TL;DR: PL-FGSA是一种基于提示学习的统一框架，用于细粒度情感分析，通过多任务提示增强生成问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度情感分析方法需要特定架构和大量标注数据，限制了其泛化性和可扩展性。

Method: PL-FGSA结合提示设计和轻量级TextCNN主干，将FGSA重新定义为多任务提示增强生成问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，PL-FGSA的F1分数分别为0.922、0.694和0.597，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PL-FGSA通过提示学习提升了泛化能力和实用性，适用于实际情感分析任务。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FGSA) aims to identify sentiment polarity
toward specific aspects within a text, enabling more precise opinion mining in
domains such as product reviews and social media. However, traditional FGSA
approaches often require task-specific architectures and extensive annotated
data, limiting their generalization and scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose PL-FGSA, a unified prompt learning-based framework
implemented using the MindSpore platform, which integrates prompt design with a
lightweight TextCNN backbone. Our method reformulates FGSA as a multi-task
prompt-augmented generation problem, jointly tackling aspect extraction,
sentiment classification, and causal explanation in a unified paradigm. By
leveraging prompt-based guidance, PL-FGSA enhances interpretability and
achieves strong performance under both full-data and low-resource conditions.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets-SST-2, SemEval-2014 Task 4, and
MAMS-demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning methods and achieves F1-scores of 0.922, 0.694, and 0.597,
respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of prompt-based
generalization and highlight the practical value of PL-FGSA for real-world
sentiment analysis tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在字符级任务上的失败原因，并提出解决方案。

Method: 使用19个合成任务分析字符级推理能力，并提出一种轻量级架构改进。

Result: 改进后的模型显著提升了字符级推理能力，同时保留了子词模型的优势。

Conclusion: 研究为理解并解决LLMs的结构性盲点提供了理论框架，并公开了代码。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress across diverse domains, Large Language
Models (LLMs) consistently fail at simple character-level tasks, such as
counting letters in words, due to a fundamental limitation: tokenization. In
this work, we frame this limitation as a problem of low mutual information and
analyze it in terms of concept emergence. Using a suite of 19 synthetic tasks
that isolate character-level reasoning in a controlled setting, we show that
such capabilities emerge slowly, suddenly, and only late in training. We
further show that percolation-based models of concept emergence explain these
patterns, suggesting that learning character composition is not fundamentally
different from learning commonsense knowledge. To address this bottleneck, we
propose a lightweight architectural modification that significantly improves
character-level reasoning while preserving the inductive advantages of subword
models. Together, our results bridge low-level perceptual gaps in tokenized LMs
and provide a principled framework for understanding and mitigating their
structural blind spots. We make our code publicly available.

*Yunlong Liang,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: THOR-MoE提出了一种结合任务引导和上下文感知的路由策略，改进了稀疏MoE在NMT中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE方案存在两个问题：1) 直接使用NMT任务知识，忽略自然分组的领域/语言特性；2) 专家选择仅依赖局部标记表示，未考虑全局上下文。

Method: THOR-MoE通过分层任务引导和上下文感知路由策略：1) 预测领域/语言标签并提取混合表示；2) 注入上下文信息优化专家选择。

Result: 在多领域和多语言翻译任务中表现优异，平均提升0.75 BLEU，激活参数少于22%。

Conclusion: THOR-MoE作为即插即用模块，兼容现有路由方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for
neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in
current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they
directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.},
domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at
practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic
properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token
representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of
each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose
THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and
context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the
domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to
allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context
information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level
experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more
specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain
translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different
architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE.
Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with
existing Top-$k$~\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures.
For instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75
BLEU with less than 22\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CoT、自一致性和微调）在推理时成本高昂，每次查询可能花费0.46美元，微调模型更是昂贵。

Method: N-rep通过利用同一模式输入的多种表示来弥补单一表示的不足，无需推理或微调，使用更小更便宜的模型。

Result: N-rep在BIRD基准测试中表现与昂贵方法相当，每次查询成本仅为0.039美元。

Conclusion: N-rep是成本范围内性能最佳的文本到SQL方法。

Abstract: LLMs are effective at code generation tasks like text-to-SQL, but is it worth
the cost? Many state-of-the-art approaches use non-task-specific LLM techniques
including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency, and fine-tuning. These
methods can be costly at inference time, sometimes requiring over a hundred LLM
calls with reasoning, incurring average costs of up to \$0.46 per query, while
fine-tuning models can cost thousands of dollars. We introduce "N-rep"
consistency, a more cost-efficient text-to-SQL approach that achieves similar
BIRD benchmark scores as other more expensive methods, at only \$0.039 per
query. N-rep leverages multiple representations of the same schema input to
mitigate weaknesses in any single representation, making the solution more
robust and allowing the use of smaller and cheaper models without any reasoning
or fine-tuning. To our knowledge, N-rep is the best-performing text-to-SQL
approach in its cost range.

Motivation: 研究分词（如BPE）如何通过模糊原子推理单元阻碍符号计算，揭示分词结构对模型推理能力的关键影响。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析不同分词方案对算术和符号任务的影响，提出原子对齐格式。

Result: 实验显示，原子对齐格式显著提升推理性能，小模型（如GPT-4o-mini）可超越大模型（如o1）。

Conclusion: 符号推理能力不仅依赖模型架构，还受分词表示深度影响，分词结构是关键因素。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation
in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer
models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate
steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by
the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and
empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly
subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic
computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the
notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts
logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures.
Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate
that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure
even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization,
allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g.,
o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning
ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on
token-level representations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构功能识别和上下文建模，显著提升了科学论文摘要的质量。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization of scientific papers has always been a research
focus, yet existing methods face two main challenges. First, most summarization
models rely on Encoder-Decoder architectures that treat papers as sequences of
words, thus fail to fully capture the structured information inherent in
scientific papers. Second, existing research often use keyword mapping or
feature engineering to identify the structural information, but these methods
struggle with the structural flexibility of scientific papers and lack
robustness across different disciplines. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage abstractive summarization framework that leverages
automatic recognition of structural functions within scientific papers. In the
first stage, we standardize chapter titles from numerous scientific papers and
construct a large-scale dataset for structural function recognition. A
classifier is then trained to automatically identify the key structural
components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), which provides a
foundation for generating more balanced summaries. In the second stage, we
employ Longformer to capture rich contextual relationships across sections and
generating context-aware summaries. Experiments conducted on two
domain-specific scientific paper summarization datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms advanced baselines, and generates more comprehensive
summaries. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Abstract: The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent
semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal
interpretation. While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been
studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their
intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored. The main reason is lacking of
a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which
can facilitate idiomatic translation. In this paper, we introduce the
interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three
sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang
translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate
translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation. To this
end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese
sentence pairs. Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is
labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation. Based on the
benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. It firstly
identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the
slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning. Further, the SlangOWL
provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current
context. Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a
suitable translation. Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and
LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the
performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the
vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.

Result: 实验表明，ThinkSwitcher减少20-30%计算成本，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: ThinkSwitcher是一种可扩展且高效的统一部署解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at solving complex tasks by leveraging
long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this often leads to
overthinking on simple tasks, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead.
We observe that LRMs inherently possess the capability for efficient short CoT
reasoning, which can be reliably elicited through prompt design. To leverage
this capability, we propose ThinkSwitcher, a framework that enables a single
LRM to dynamically switch between short and long CoT modes based on task
complexity. ThinkSwitcher introduces a lightweight switching module trained
with supervision signals derived from the relative performance of each
reasoning mode across tasks. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show
that ThinkSwitcher reduces computational cost by 20-30% while maintaining high
accuracy on complex tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ThinkSwitcher
as a scalable and efficient solution for unified LRM deployment.

Result: 论文量化了AO、AM和AV的动态关系，揭示了人口统计元数据对任务性能和隐私风险的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM时代的作者隐私提供了统一分析框架，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been fueled by large
scale training corpora drawn from diverse sources such as websites, news
articles, and books. These datasets often contain explicit user information,
such as person names and addresses, that LLMs may unintentionally reproduce in
their generated outputs. Beyond such explicit content, LLMs can also leak
identity revealing cues through implicit signals such as distinctive writing
styles, raising significant concerns about authorship privacy. There are three
major automated tasks in authorship privacy, namely authorship obfuscation
(AO), authorship mimicking (AM), and authorship verification (AV). Prior
research has studied AO, AM, and AV independently. However, their interplays
remain under explored, which leaves a major research gap, especially in the era
of LLMs, where they are profoundly shaping how we curate and share user
generated content, and the distinction between machine generated and human
authored text is also increasingly blurred. This work then presents the first
unified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,
AM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact
with each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single
point in time and iteratively over time. We also examine the role of
demographic metadata, such as gender, academic background, in modulating their
performances, inter-task dynamics, and privacy risks. All source code will be
publicly available.

Motivation: 当前QA系统在处理复杂推理和实时知识整合时表现不佳，RAG技术仍面临多源信息逻辑连接的挑战。

Method: 利用LLMs生成微调数据，包括自动QA生成器和模型微调器，使用困惑度、ROUGE、BLEU和BERTScore评估。

Result: 实验显示逻辑连贯性和事实准确性提升，Mistral-7b-v0.3在BERT F1、BLEU和ROUGE得分上优于Llama-3-8b。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发适应性强的AI系统提供了潜力，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: A question-answering (QA) system is to search suitable answers within a
knowledge base. Current QA systems struggle with queries requiring complex
reasoning or real-time knowledge integration. They are often supplemented with
retrieval techniques on a data source such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). However, RAG continues to face challenges in handling complex reasoning
and logical connections between multiple sources of information. A novel
approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive QA
tasks is presented through the automated generation of context-based QA pairs.
This methodology leverages LLMs to create fine-tuning data, reducing reliance
on human labelling and improving model comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. The proposed system includes an automated QA generator and a
model fine-tuner, evaluated using perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improvements in logical coherence and
factual accuracy, with implications for developing adaptable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. Mistral-7b-v0.3 outperforms Llama-3-8b with BERT F1,
BLEU, and ROUGE scores 0.858, 0.172, and 0.260 of for the LLM generated QA
pairs compared to scores of 0.836, 0.083, and 0.139 for the human annotated QA
pairs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用代码混合和语音扰动的新型策略，成功破解多语言多模态大语言模型的安全过滤器，攻击成功率高达99%（文本）和78%（图像）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对英语，且使用固定模板攻击，导致模型在多语言和多模态环境下仍易受攻击。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过代码混合和语音扰动（如敏感词的拼写错误）生成新型提示，绕过安全过滤器。

Result: 新型提示在文本生成中攻击成功率达99%，图像生成达78%，且攻击相关性高（文本100%，图像95%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语音扰动对分词的影响，呼吁加强多语言多模态模型的通用安全对齐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with
multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are
being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to
expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair
content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English
language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be
susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the
multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages
code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and
image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that
show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method
to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability
by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our
novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for
image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and
95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed
prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations
impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates
increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for
multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein
prompts can have misspelt words.

*Hakaze Cho,Peng Luo,Mariko Kato,Rin Kaenbyou,Naoya Inoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为注意力行为微调（ABFT）的方法，通过优化注意力分数而非最终输出，以减少上下文学习（ICL）的计算成本，并在性能、鲁棒性、无偏性和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法需要大量计算资源进行端到端微调，而ABFT旨在通过优化注意力机制来降低这种成本。

Method: ABFT利用ICL内部机制的研究成果，通过调整注意力分数使其聚焦于正确的标签标记，减少对错误标签标记的关注。

Result: 在9种现代语言模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，ABFT在性能、鲁棒性、无偏性和效率上表现优异，数据成本仅为现有方法的0.01%。

Conclusion: ABFT展示了通过控制语言模型内部模块来改进其行为的可能性，为机制可解释性的未来应用开辟了道路。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to
induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally
pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training,
some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end
paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper,
we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous
findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the
attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to
focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate
attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs
and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance,
robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost
compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that
the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the
implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work
demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within
LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic
interpretability.

TL;DR: ABBA是一种新的参数高效微调（PEFT）架构，通过解耦更新与预训练权重，显著提升了表达能力，并在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但高效适应新领域仍具挑战性。现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）的表达能力受限于低秩分解。

Method: ABBA通过将更新重新参数化为两个可独立学习的低秩矩阵的Hadamard积，完全解耦了更新与预训练权重。

Result: ABBA在矩阵重构实验中验证了其优势，并在算术和常识推理基准测试中显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: ABBA提供了一种更高效的PEFT方法，为模型适应新领域提供了更强的表达能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide
range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key
challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by
introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained
weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank
decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank.
Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a
Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of
the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that
reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable
low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update
from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely.
This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter
budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its
advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA
achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning
benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant
margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 自动化文献综述在言语病理学领域的需求，以提高分类效率和精确性。

Method: 从PubMed数据库检索4804篇相关文章，使用LDA和BERTopic进行主题建模，并结合自定义停用词表。

Result: LDA模型一致性得分0.42，困惑度-7.5；BERTopic模型异常主题比例低于20%。

Conclusion: 该方法为言语病理学领域的自动化文献综述提供了有效基础。

Abstract: This technical report presents a natural language processing (NLP)-based
approach for systematically classifying scientific literature on childhood
speech disorders. We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published
after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After
cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling
techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify
latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically
meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic
behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop
word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA
model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating
strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited
a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity
to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a
foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.

Motivation: 通用机器翻译模型在工业场景中因领域术语、文化差异和风格惯例不足而表现不佳，现有评估框架无法满足专业需求。

Method: 提出三级翻译能力框架（基础语言能力、领域专业能力、文化适应能力），并开发TransBench基准，结合传统指标与领域专用模型Marco-MOS。

Conclusion: 该工作为工业机器翻译提供了系统性评估方法，助力研究者和从业者优化领域专用翻译系统。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) has become indispensable for cross-border
communication in globalized industries like e-commerce, finance, and legal
services, with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
significantly enhancing translation quality. However, applying general-purpose
MT models to industrial scenarios reveals critical limitations due to
domain-specific terminology, cultural nuances, and stylistic conventions absent
in generic benchmarks. Existing evaluation frameworks inadequately assess
performance in specialized contexts, creating a gap between academic benchmarks
and real-world efficacy. To address this, we propose a three-level translation
capability framework: (1) Basic Linguistic Competence, (2) Domain-Specific
Proficiency, and (3) Cultural Adaptation, emphasizing the need for holistic
evaluation across these dimensions. We introduce TransBench, a benchmark
tailored for industrial MT, initially targeting international e-commerce with
17,000 professionally translated sentences spanning 4 main scenarios and 33
language pairs. TransBench integrates traditional metrics (BLEU, TER) with
Marco-MOS, a domain-specific evaluation model, and provides guidelines for
reproducible benchmark construction. Our contributions include: (1) a
structured framework for industrial MT evaluation, (2) the first publicly
available benchmark for e-commerce translation, (3) novel metrics probing
multi-level translation quality, and (4) open-sourced evaluation tools. This
work bridges the evaluation gap, enabling researchers and practitioners to
systematically assess and enhance MT systems for industry-specific needs.

We adopt a two-stage strategy to train FuxiMT. We first pre-train the model on
a massive Chinese corpus and then conduct multilingual fine-tuning on a large
parallel dataset encompassing 65 languages. FuxiMT incorporates
Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) and employs a curriculum learning strategy for robust
performance across various resource levels. Experimental results demonstrate
that FuxiMT significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation models, particularly under
low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, FuxiMT exhibits remarkable zero-shot
translation capabilities for unseen language pairs, indicating its potential to
bridge communication gaps where parallel data are scarce or unavailable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLOT是一种参数高效的测试时推理方法，通过少量优化步骤更新样本特定参数向量，提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，SLOT旨在通过测试时优化解决这一问题。

Method: SLOT在测试时对轻量级样本特定参数向量进行优化，并将其添加到最终隐藏层前，通过最小化输入提示的交叉熵损失实现高效适配。

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和语言模型中表现优异，例如Qwen2.5-7B在GSM8K上的准确率提升8.6%。

Conclusion: SLOT通过测试时优化显著提升了语言模型对复杂指令的处理能力，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

Result: 实验表明，Think-J显著提升了生成式LLM-Judge的评估能力，优于生成式和基于分类器的LLM-Judge。

Conclusion: Think-J方法无需额外人工标注即可有效提升LLM-Judge的性能。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge refers to the automatic modeling of preferences for responses
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which is of significant importance
for both LLM evaluation and reward modeling. Although generative LLMs have made
substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still
falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves
generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small
amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking
capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on
reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking
optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL
requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples
for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for
optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly
enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both
generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human
annotations.

Conclusion: FAID为提升AI辅助写作的透明度和责任性提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: The growing collaboration between humans and AI models in generative tasks
has introduced new challenges in distinguishing between human-written,
AI-generated, and human-AI collaborative texts. In this work, we collect a
multilingual, multi-domain, multi-generator dataset FAIDSet. We further
introduce a fine-grained detection framework FAID to classify text into these
three categories, meanwhile identifying the underlying AI model family. Unlike
existing binary classifiers, FAID is built to capture both authorship and
model-specific characteristics. Our method combines multi-level contrastive
learning with multi-task auxiliary classification to learn subtle stylistic
cues. By modeling AI families as distinct stylistic entities, FAID offers
improved interpretability. We incorporate an adaptation to address
distributional shifts without retraining for unseen data. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAID outperforms several baseline approaches, particularly
enhancing the generalization accuracy on unseen domains and new AI models. It
provide a potential solution for improving transparency and accountability in
AI-assisted writing.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可扩展，适用于新语言和任务，同时通过最大边际相关性优化检索结果。

Abstract: Considering the importance of detecting hateful language, labeled hate speech
data is expensive and time-consuming to collect, particularly for low-resource
languages. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual
transfer learning and data augmentation in improving performance on tasks with
limited labeled data. To develop an efficient and scalable cross-lingual
transfer learning approach, we leverage nearest-neighbor retrieval to augment
minimal labeled data in the target language, thereby enhancing detection
performance. Specifically, we assume access to a small set of labeled training
instances in the target language and use these to retrieve the most relevant
labeled examples from a large multilingual hate speech detection pool. We
evaluate our approach on eight languages and demonstrate that it consistently
outperforms models trained solely on the target language data. Furthermore, in
most cases, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Notably, our
approach is highly data-efficient, retrieving as small as 200 instances in some
cases while maintaining superior performance. Moreover, it is scalable, as the
retrieval pool can be easily expanded, and the method can be readily adapted to
new languages and tasks. We also apply maximum marginal relevance to mitigate
redundancy and filter out highly similar retrieved instances, resulting in
improvements in some languages.

Motivation: 语音LLMs的灵活性可能使其更易受对抗攻击，研究旨在评估其脆弱性。

Method: 通过在原始音频前添加固定对抗音频片段，研究模型对攻击的反应，并扩展至选择性攻击（针对特定输入属性）。

Result: 发现Qwen2-Audio和Granite-Speech等模型存在关键漏洞，易受通用对抗攻击。

Conclusion: 需加强模型训练策略和对抗攻击抵抗力。

Abstract: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has
enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken
language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this
very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To
examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal
acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal,
adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We
initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output
or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend
the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when
specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are
present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing
fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical
vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar
speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This
highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance
to adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）在多语言环境下过度依赖英语性能，尤其在数据受限时表现不佳。

Method: CLO结合公开英语SFT数据和翻译模型实现跨语言迁移，实验覆盖五种模型和六种语言。

Result: CLO在目标语言学习和英语能力保持上均优于SFT，低资源语言中仅需3200样本即超越SFT的6400样本表现。

Conclusion: CLO在数据效率和鲁棒性上显著优于SFT，尤其适合中低资源语言场景。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to other languages typically employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a standard approach. However, it often suffers
from an overemphasis on English performance, a phenomenon that is especially
pronounced in data-constrained environments. To overcome these challenges, we
propose \textbf{Cross-Lingual Optimization (CLO)} that efficiently transfers an
English-centric LLM to a target language while preserving its English
capabilities. CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a
translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments
using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource.
Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target
language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in
low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400
samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data.
Furthermore, we find that SFT is particularly sensitive to data quantity in
medium and low-resource languages, whereas CLO remains robust. Our
comprehensive analysis emphasizes the limitations of SFT and incorporates
additional training strategies in CLO to enhance efficiency.

Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在Text-to-SQL任务中存在多阶段流程复杂和噪声模式信息鲁棒性差的挑战。

Method: JOLT-SQL采用判别式模式链接（增强的局部双向注意力）和混淆感知的噪声模式采样策略（选择性注意力），统一优化模式链接和SQL生成。

Result: 在Spider和BIRD基准测试中，JOLT-SQL在同类开源模型中实现了最先进的执行准确率，同时显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: JOLT-SQL通过单阶段框架和噪声鲁棒性策略，有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which maps natural language to SQL queries, has benefited
greatly from recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer
various paradigms for this task, including prompting and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), SFT approaches still face challenges such as complex multi-stage
pipelines and poor robustness to noisy schema information. To address these
limitations, we present JOLT-SQL, a streamlined single-stage SFT framework that
jointly optimizes schema linking and SQL generation via a unified loss.
JOLT-SQL employs discriminative schema linking, enhanced by local bidirectional
attention, alongside a confusion-aware noisy schema sampling strategy with
selective attention to improve robustness under noisy schema conditions.
Experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that JOLT-SQL
achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among comparable-size open-source

Method: 系统研究不同重叠水平对训练和推理的影响，通过生成合成上下文（如查询转述）增加重叠。

Result: 重叠超过临界阈值后显著提升测试困惑度并加速学习；合成上下文可减少40%训练时间且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 检索机制在语言模型预训练中具有显著优化潜力，合成上下文是提升效率的有效方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models have demonstrated performance comparable
to much larger models while requiring fewer computational resources. The
effectiveness of these models crucially depends on the overlap between query
and retrieved context, but the optimal degree of this overlap remains
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how varying levels of
query--context overlap affect model performance during both training and
inference. Our experiments reveal that increased overlap initially has minimal
effect, but substantially improves test-time perplexity and accelerates model
learning above a critical threshold. Building on these findings, we demonstrate
that deliberately increasing overlap through synthetic context can enhance data
efficiency and reduce training time by approximately 40\% without compromising
performance. We specifically generate synthetic context through paraphrasing
queries. We validate our perplexity-based findings on question-answering tasks,
confirming that the benefits of retrieval-augmented language modeling extend to
practical applications. Our results provide empirical evidence of significant
optimization potential for retrieval mechanisms in language model pretraining.

Abstract: Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in
recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite
having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2)
speakers worldwide. While significant advances have been made in high-resource
languages, Hausa NLP faces persistent challenges, including limited open-source
datasets and inadequate model representation. This paper presents an overview
of the current state of Hausa NLP, systematically examining existing resources,
research contributions, and gaps across fundamental NLP tasks: text
classification, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech
recognition, and question answering. We introduce HausaNLP
(https://catalog.hausanlp.org), a curated catalog that aggregates datasets,
tools, and research works to enhance accessibility and drive further
development. Furthermore, we discuss challenges in integrating Hausa into large
language models (LLMs), addressing issues of suboptimal tokenization and
dialectal variation. Finally, we propose strategic research directions
emphasizing dataset expansion, improved language modeling approaches, and
strengthened community collaboration to advance Hausa NLP. Our work provides
both a foundation for accelerating Hausa NLP progress and valuable insights for
broader multilingual NLP research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIND的元学习方法，用于提升小型语言模型在推理任务中的泛化能力，尤其是在未见知识库上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在形式化任务中表现优异，但在泛化到分布外问题时能力有限。本文旨在研究如何让模型系统理解演绎规则。

Method: 提出Meta-learning for In-context Deduction (MIND)，一种少样本元学习微调方法，专注于从知识库中选择合适的前提子集以推导假设。

Result: MIND显著提升了1.5B到7B参数的小型模型的泛化能力，尤其在低数据环境下表现突出。小型模型甚至优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: MIND方法有效提升了小型语言模型的推理和泛化能力，尤其在资源受限的场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on formal tasks,
where strong reasoning abilities define the state of the art. However, their
ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems remains limited. In this
paper, we investigate how LLMs can achieve a systematic understanding of
deductive rules. Our focus is on the task of identifying the appropriate subset
of premises within a knowledge base needed to derive a given hypothesis. To
tackle this challenge, we propose Meta-learning for In-context Deduction
(MIND), a novel few-shot meta-learning fine-tuning approach. The goal of MIND
is to enable models to generalize more effectively to unseen knowledge bases
and to systematically apply inference rules. Our results show that MIND
significantly improves generalization in small LMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B
parameters. The benefits are especially pronounced in smaller models and
low-data settings. Remarkably, small models fine-tuned with MIND outperform
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and o3-mini, on this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在长文本摘要中因位置偏差导致的关键信息提取不足问题。

Method: 提出QA-prompting，通过问答步骤提取关键信息并丰富上下文，再生成摘要。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，QA-prompting比基线方法提升高达29%的ROUGE分数。

Conclusion: QA-prompting是一种高效、可扩展的摘要方法，强调领域特定问题选择的重要性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
enabling high-quality text generation through prompting and in-context
learning. However, models often struggle with long-context summarization due to
positional biases, leading to suboptimal extraction of critical information.
There are techniques to improve this with fine-tuning, pipelining, or using
complex techniques, which have their own challenges. To solve these challenges,
we propose QA-prompting - a simple prompting method for summarization that
utilizes question-answering as an intermediate step prior to summary
generation. Our method extracts key information and enriches the context of
text to mitigate positional biases and improve summarization in a single LM
call per task without requiring fine-tuning or pipelining. Experiments on
multiple datasets belonging to different domains using ten state-of-the-art
pre-trained models demonstrate that QA-prompting outperforms baseline and other
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 29% improvement in ROUGE scores. This
provides an effective and scalable solution for summarization and highlights
the importance of domain-specific question selection for optimal performance.

TL;DR: OSoRA是一种新型参数高效微调方法，通过结合SVD和可学习缩放向量，显著减少计算资源需求，同时保持或超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型规模庞大且计算成本高，传统微调方法难以实现高效优化，因此需要更高效的参数微调方法。

Method: OSoRA扩展了LoRA，通过SVD分解预训练权重矩阵，并优化输出维度向量，同时冻结奇异向量矩阵，减少可训练参数。

Result: 在数学推理、常识推理等任务中，OSoRA性能与LoRA和VeRA相当或更优，且参数随秩线性增长。

Conclusion: OSoRA通过联合训练奇异值和输出维度向量，实现了高效微调，为大规模语言模型提供了可行的优化方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
due to their massive scale and associated computational costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodologies have been proposed as
computational alternatives; however, their implementations still require
significant resources. In this paper, we present OSoRA (Output-Dimension and
Singular-Value Initialized Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method for LLMs.
OSoRA extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by integrating Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) with learnable scaling vectors in a unified framework. It
first performs an SVD of pre-trained weight matrices, then optimizes an
output-dimension vector during training, while keeping the corresponding
singular vector matrices frozen. OSoRA substantially reduces computational
resource requirements by minimizing the number of trainable parameters during
fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, common
sense reasoning, and other benchmarks demonstrate that OSoRA achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA and
VeRA, while maintaining a linear parameter scaling even as the rank increases
to higher dimensions. Our ablation studies further confirm that jointly
training both the singular values and the output-dimension vector is critical
for optimal performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad
array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical
reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In
this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless
communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated
questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a
diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to
complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions,
all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through
extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models
excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when
reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental
limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our
benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83%
success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing
WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the
development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and
broader engineering applications.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法因随机初始化适配器参数导致训练不稳定和知识转移效率低。

Method: DuDe将权重矩阵分解为幅度和方向分量，采用SVD进行初始化。

Result: 在MMLU和GSM8K上分别达到48.35%和62.53%的准确率，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DuDe通过分解策略提升了优化稳定性并保留了预训练表示，是PEFT领域的重要贡献。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical paradigm for
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, among which Low-rank
Adaptation (LoRA) represents one of the most widely adopted methodologies.
However, existing LoRA-based approaches exhibit two fundamental limitations:
unstable training dynamics and inefficient knowledge transfer from pre-trained
models, both stemming from random initialization of adapter parameters. To
overcome these challenges, we propose DuDe, a novel approach that decomposes
weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, employing Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) for principled initialization. Our comprehensive
evaluation demonstrates DuDe's superior performance and robustness, achieving
up to 48.35\% accuracy on MMLU and 62.53\% ($\pm$ 1.59) accuracy on GSM8K. Our
theoretical analysis and empirical validation collectively demonstrate that
DuDe's decomposition strategy enhances optimization stability and better
preserves pre-trained representations, particularly for domain-specific tasks
requiring specialized knowledge. The combination of robust empirical
performance and rigorous theoretical foundations establishes DuDe as a
significant contribution to PEFT methodologies for LLMs.

Abstract: Generating a review for an academic research paper is a complex task that
requires a deep understanding of the document's content and the
interdependencies between its sections. It demands not only insight into
technical details but also an appreciation of the paper's overall coherence and
structure. Recent methods have predominantly focused on fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. However, they often overlook
the computational and performance limitations imposed by long input token
lengths. To address this, we introduce AutoRev, an Automatic Peer Review System
for Academic Research Papers. Our novel framework represents an academic
document as a graph, enabling the extraction of the most critical passages that
contribute significantly to the review. This graph-based approach demonstrates
effectiveness for review generation and is potentially adaptable to various
downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and document
representation. When applied to review generation, our method outperforms SOTA
baselines by an average of 58.72% across all evaluation metrics. We hope that
our work will stimulate further research in applying graph-based extraction
techniques to other downstream tasks in NLP. We plan to make our code public
upon acceptance.

Motivation: 评估低资源语言中大型语言模型的文本生成能力具有挑战性，现有方法稀缺且依赖高资源语言工具。

Method: 将现有基准转化为对话任务，以任务成功率作为生成能力的代理指标，避免使用语言特定工具或LLMs作为评判者。

Result: 在30种语言上评估8个LLM，MUG-Eval与现有基准强相关（r>0.75），支持跨语言和模型的标准化比较。

Conclusion: MUG-Eval为多语言生成评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于数千种语言。

Abstract: Evaluating text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is
challenging, particularly for low-resource languages where methods for direct
assessment are scarce. We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates
LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks
into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We
specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective
communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as
a proxy of successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key
advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated
datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on
LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource
languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and
low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with
established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons
across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and
resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be
extended to thousands of languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）及其代理版本难以保留和复用过去的推理经验，限制了其在未来任务中的应用能力。

Method: LAG框架利用键值（KV）缓存表示任务日志，存储部分关键令牌的推理上下文，并在新任务中检索相关日志以增强生成。

Result: 实验表明，LAG在知识和推理密集型数据集上显著优于未使用日志的标准代理系统及现有基于反射和KV缓存的技术。

Conclusion: LAG通过直接复用过去的推理和计算，无需额外知识提取步骤，有效提升了模型在新任务中的表现。

Abstract: While humans naturally learn and adapt from past experiences, large language
models (LLMs) and their agentic counterparts struggle to retain reasoning from
previous tasks and apply them in future contexts. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel framework, log-augmented generation (LAG) that directly
reuses prior computation and reasoning from past logs at test time to enhance
model's ability to learn from previous tasks and perform better on new, unseen
challenges, all while keeping the system efficient and scalable. Specifically,
our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full
reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected
subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from
relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based
memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without
requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method
also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target
efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy. Experiments on knowledge- and
reasoning-intensive datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms standard agentic systems that do not utilize logs, as well as
existing solutions based on reflection and KV cache techniques.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）存在知识遮蔽问题，即激活的知识可能掩盖其他相关信息，导致错误输出。目前对其起源和训练机制的理解不足，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 提出PhantomCircuit框架，利用知识电路分析，剖析注意力头的内部机制，追踪竞争知识路径如何导致遮蔽现象及其在训练中的演变。

Result: 实验证明PhantomCircuit能有效识别知识遮蔽实例，为研究提供了新的方法论视角。

Conclusion: PhantomCircuit为理解和缓解知识遮蔽现象提供了新工具和见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are
hampered by hallucinations. A particularly challenging variant, knowledge
overshadowing, occurs when one piece of activated knowledge inadvertently masks
another relevant piece, leading to erroneous outputs even with high-quality
training data. Current understanding of overshadowing is largely confined to
inference-time observations, lacking deep insights into its origins and
internal mechanisms during model training. Therefore, we introduce
PhantomCircuit, a novel framework designed to comprehensively analyze and
detect knowledge overshadowing. By innovatively employing knowledge circuit
analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the internal workings of attention heads,
tracing how competing knowledge pathways contribute to the overshadowing
phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process. Extensive
experiments demonstrate PhantomCircuit's effectiveness in identifying such
instances, offering novel insights into this elusive hallucination and
providing the research community with a new methodological lens for its
potential mitigation.

Conclusion: AgentGhost展示了GUI代理的后门攻击风险，同时提出的防御方法为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due
to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or
APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored
supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that
MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers,
such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this
observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for
red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite
triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to
unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we
formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses
supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across
sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the
backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the
discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing
effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two
established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic,
with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows
stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a
defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance

well on simple tasks, their performance degrades significantly on more complex
tasks. We present a detailed error analysis of the gaps in instruction
generalization.

Conclusion: 神经不兼容性是跨尺度PKT的主要障碍，为未来高效PKT研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible
parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and
transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional
knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine
Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods
for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters
presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first
demonstrate $\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental
prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously
explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes
extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune
for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a
novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called
$\textbf{LaTen}$
($\textbf{L}$oc$\textbf{a}$te-$\textbf{T}$h$\textbf{e}$n-Alig$\textbf{n}$) that
aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training
steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks
demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving
consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify
$\textbf{Neural Incompatibility}$ as the ethological and parametric structural
differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges
to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the
parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future
research on efficient PKT. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出Creative Preference Optimization (CrPO)方法，通过多维度创造力信号优化LLM的生成内容，在保持质量的同时提升新颖性、多样性和惊喜感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提升LLM创造力时过于单一，未能全面解决创造力的多维度问题。

Method: 提出CrPO方法，结合MuCE数据集（包含20万人类生成响应和30多项创造力评估），在偏好优化目标中注入多维度创造力信号。

Result: 模型在自动和人工评估中均优于GPT-4o等基线，生成内容更具新颖性、多样性和惊喜感。

Conclusion: 直接优化创造力是提升LLM创意能力的有效方向，且不影响输出质量。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across natural language generation tasks, their ability to generate truly
creative content-characterized by novelty, diversity, surprise, and
quality-remains limited. Existing methods for enhancing LLM creativity often
focus narrowly on diversity or specific tasks, failing to address creativity's
multifaceted nature in a generalizable way. In this work, we propose Creative
Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals
from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective
in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of
several models using CrPO and MuCE, a new large-scale human preference dataset
spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30
psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines,
including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more
novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output
quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the
generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that
directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising
direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising
output quality.

Result: CtrlDiff在混合扩散模型中表现优异，缩小了与最先进自回归模型的性能差距，支持多样化的条件文本生成任务。

Conclusion: CtrlDiff为扩散语言模型提供了动态可控的解决方案，显著提升了生成灵活性和效率。

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent
years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to
the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language
models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel
generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are
often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to
combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,
modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete
diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the
preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered
by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible
control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed
granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language
models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive
framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on
local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a
classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which
significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient
post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the
performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables
effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting
verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1,
Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We
construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing
that AM-Thinking-v1-distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and
lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on
reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench.
The AM-based model consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on
AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and
demonstrates adaptive output behavior-producing longer responses for harder
tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of
high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer语言模型中未激活的层（Voids），并提出了一种非训练、参数自由的L2自适应计算（LAC）方法，用于识别这些层。实验表明跳过这些层可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的语言模型取得了进展，但推理过程中是否所有层都被激活仍是一个未解问题。

Method: 使用LAC方法监控激活的L2范数变化，识别未激活层（Voids），并在指令调优的模型中分析提示处理和响应生成阶段的层激活情况。

Result: 实验表明，跳过未激活层可以提升模型性能，例如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct在MMLU任务中准确率从69.24提升到71.29，同时仅使用30%的层。

Conclusion: 并非所有层在推理中贡献均等，选择性跳过未激活层可以提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in transformer-based language models (LMs), a fundamental
question remains largely unanswered: Are all layers activated during inference?
We investigate this question by detecting unactivated layers (which we refer to
as Voids) using a non-trainable and parameter-free adaptive computation method
called L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC). We adapt LAC from its original
efficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This
method monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We
analyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt
Processing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input
prompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each
generated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated
during these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated
three distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families
on three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a
zero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an
improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers.
Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to
18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases. These
results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that
selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on
certain tasks.

causing model's harmful behaviors. In addition, we explore cultural dimensions
by distinguishing between universally unsafe and culturally-specific unsafe
queries. This paper presents novel experimental insights, clarifying the
mechanisms driving this phenomenon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引用分类对学术分析至关重要，但直接微调预训练语言模型面临数据稀缺、上下文噪声和关键词虚假相关等挑战。

Method: Citss引入自监督对比学习，采用句子级裁剪和关键词扰动策略生成对比对，兼容编码器和解码器模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Citss优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Citss有效解决了引用分类中的挑战，并展示了与多种预训练模型的兼容性。

Abstract: Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic
citations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest
fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification
datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during
pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is
challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious
keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss,
that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces
self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is
equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs:
sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long
contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific
keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for
encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both
encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged
pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based
PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the
previous state of the art. Our code is available at: github.com/LITONG99/Citss

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在城市规划地图分析中表现不佳，无法满足专业需求，因此需要开发专用模型。

Method: 采用PlanAnno-V框架合成高质量数据，引入Critical Point Thinking减少幻觉，结合监督微调和冻结视觉编码器参数。

Result: PlanGPT-VL在PlanBench-V基准测试中表现优异，优于通用模型，且7B参数模型性能接近72B参数模型。

Conclusion: PlanGPT-VL为城市规划提供了高效、可靠的地图分析工具，同时保持了高准确性和轻量化。

Abstract: In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the
critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related
educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure
layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial
configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address
this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific
Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL
employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality
VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations
through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology
combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through
systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate
that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs
in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning
professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational
applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B
parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B
parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing
performance.

Motivation: 解决现有内容审核方法需为每个社区单独训练模型且决策不透明的问题。

Method: 提出MoMoE框架，包含分配、预测、聚合和解释四个操作，分为社区专家和规范违规专家两类。

Result: 在30个子版块测试中，MoMoE性能优异（Micro-F1 0.72/0.67），并提供可靠解释。

Conclusion: MoMoE无需为每个社区微调，即可实现可扩展、透明的审核，为可信人机协作提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in flagging harmful
content in online communities. Yet, existing approaches for moderation require
a separate model for every community and are opaque in their decision-making,
limiting real-world adoption. We introduce Mixture of Moderation Experts
(MoMoE), a modular, cross-community framework that adds post-hoc explanations
to scalable content moderation. MoMoE orchestrates four operators -- Allocate,
Predict, Aggregate, Explain -- and is instantiated as seven
community-specialized experts (MoMoE-Community) and five norm-violation experts
(MoMoE-NormVio). On 30 unseen subreddits, the best variants obtain Micro-F1
scores of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, matching or surpassing strong fine-tuned
baselines while consistently producing concise and reliable explanations.
Although community-specialized experts deliver the highest peak accuracy,
norm-violation experts provide steadier performance across domains. These
findings show that MoMoE yields scalable, transparent moderation without
needing per-community fine-tuning. More broadly, they suggest that lightweight,
explainable expert ensembles can guide future NLP and HCI research on
trustworthy human-AI governance of online communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出LRSA框架，结合小语言模型（SLM）的决策能力与大语言模型（LLM）的额外信息，通过注入LLM生成的解释并采用双交叉注意力机制，提升多模态方面情感分析（MABSA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MABSA方法依赖小语言模型（SLM），但其能力有限，导致对文本和视觉数据中方面、情感及其关联的识别不准确。大语言模型（LLM）虽在多模态任务中表现优异，但在ABSA领域仍不及微调的小模型。

Method: 提出LRSA框架，将LLM生成的解释作为理性注入SLM，并采用双交叉注意力机制增强特征交互与融合，提升SLM的方面和情感识别能力。

Result: 在两个基线模型和三个基准数据集上的实验表明，LRSA方法优于现有方法，具有通用性和适用性。

Conclusion: LRSA框架通过结合SLM和LLM的优势，显著提升了MABSA任务的性能，为预训练模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
(MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained
small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and
sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities.
However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in
inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their
interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language
models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by
effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However,
some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small
models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel
framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs
with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject
explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual
cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby
augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated
our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the
superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its
generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Method: 提出ModRWKV框架，采用轻量级多模态模块设计，并利用RWKV7的预训练权重进行初始化。

Result: 实验表明，ModRWKV在性能和计算效率之间取得了平衡，预训练权重显著提升了多模态信号理解能力。

Conclusion: 现代RNN架构是多模态大语言模型中Transformer的可行替代方案，ModRWKV的最优配置通过系统探索确定。

Abstract: Currently, most multimodal studies are based on large language models (LLMs)
with quadratic-complexity Transformer architectures. While linear models like
RNNs enjoy low inference costs, their application has been largely limited to
the text-only modality. This work explores the capabilities of modern RNN
architectures in multimodal contexts. We propose ModRWKV-a decoupled multimodal
framework built upon the RWKV7 architecture as its LLM backbone-which achieves
multi-source information fusion through dynamically adaptable heterogeneous
modality encoders. We designed the multimodal modules in ModRWKV with an
extremely lightweight architecture and, through extensive experiments,
identified a configuration that achieves an optimal balance between performance
and computational efficiency. ModRWKV leverages the pretrained weights of the
RWKV7 LLM for initialization, which significantly accelerates multimodal
training. Comparative experiments with different pretrained checkpoints further
demonstrate that such initialization plays a crucial role in enhancing the
model's ability to understand multimodal signals. Supported by extensive
experiments, we conclude that modern RNN architectures present a viable
alternative to Transformers in the domain of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Furthermore, we identify the optimal configuration of the ModRWKV
architecture through systematic exploration.

Method: 提出GFoLDS原型，一种基于图逻辑形式的预训练模型，并通过实验对比文本模型。

Result: GFoLDS在少量数据下显著优于文本模型，且性能随参数和数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: LFLMs具有高效学习能力，适合实际应用，未来可扩展性高。

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that
such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that
end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics
(GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical
forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong
experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic
knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex
patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual,
transformer LMs pretrained on similar amounts of data, indicating that LFLMs
can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text.
Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with
additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs
in real-world applications.

Result: 在15个两步骤复合任务和TRACE基准测试中，均观察到子任务按层顺序执行的模式。

Conclusion: LLMs具备内部规划和执行子任务的能力，为细粒度指令级激活调控提供新思路。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal
chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks
layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned
at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially
across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ
layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method,
confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden
states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further
replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing
the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by
showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or
instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation
steering.

Motivation: 尽管现有方法广泛用于减少语言模型的有毒输出，但容易被绕过。本文旨在通过更精确的因果干预提升模型安全性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器识别毒性相关方向，并通过解码器向量进行激活导向，分为三种强度。

Result: 强导向可减少毒性达20%，但可能影响流畅性；标准NLP基准分数保持稳定。

Conclusion: SAE为基础的干预在解毒方面有潜力，但需权衡毒性减少与流畅性，并关注特征解耦。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications,
yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity,
vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods
exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be
circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual
stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the
corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering
aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing
trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger
steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in
reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2
Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores
upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general
abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs
hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled
feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further
suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning
capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot
fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation,
we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic
evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over
fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive,
multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we
conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent
reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior
performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of
modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response
length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for
advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited
to complex, interactive environments.

Method: 采用两种方法：完全监督的转移方法和半监督的回译方法。

Result: 转移方法在开发测试集上SacreBLEU得分为14.2，比基线高6.6分；回译方法略低于基线15.1分。

Conclusion: 讨论了性能不足的原因，并提出了未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Certain pairs of languages suffer from lack of a parallel corpus which is
large in size and diverse in domain. One of the ways this is overcome is via
use of a pivot language. In this paper we use Hindi as a pivot language to
translate Nepali into English. We describe what makes Hindi a good candidate
for the pivot. We discuss ways in which a pivot language can be used, and use
two such approaches - the Transfer Method (fully supervised) and
Backtranslation (semi-supervised) - to translate Nepali into English. Using the
former, we are able to achieve a devtest Set SacreBLEU score of 14.2, which
improves the baseline fully supervised score reported by (Guzman et al., 2019)
by 6.6 points. While we are slightly below the semi-supervised baseline score
of 15.1, we discuss what may have caused this under-performance, and suggest
scope for future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRATES是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化论文评分框架，专注于评估论文的个体特质，通过结合特质评分标准和通用特征，实现了在未见过的题目上的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化论文评分（AES）研究多关注整体评分，而忽视了针对个体特质的评估。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出TRATES框架，利用LLM生成特质特定特征（评估问题），并结合通用写作质量和题目特定特征，训练回归模型预测特质分数。

Result: TRATES在广泛使用的数据集上实现了所有特质的最新最优性能，LLM生成的特征贡献最大。

Conclusion: TRATES为特质特定的AES提供了高效且通用的解决方案，LLM生成的特征是关键因素。

Abstract: Research on holistic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is long-dated; yet, there
is a notable lack of attention for assessing essays according to individual
traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and
rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the
underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that
utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features
(represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an
essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic
writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical
regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt.
Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across
all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features
being the most significant.

*Shangziqi Zhao,Jiahao Yuan,Guisong Yang,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune-on-Logic框架通过逻辑图剪枝优化长链思维推理，验证步骤剪枝能提升小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理（Long-CoT）虽提升大模型准确性，但其冗长风格难以有效压缩至小模型。

Method: 提出Prune-on-Logic框架，将Long-CoT转为逻辑图，选择性剪枝低效用推理步骤。

Result: 验证步骤剪枝提升准确性并降低推理成本，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 剪枝是优化小模型推理能力的有效策略，需关注语义精简而非单纯缩短推理链。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its
verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small
language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of
capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose
Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic
graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under
self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning
strategies -- targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification -- we
find that pruning verification steps yields consistent accuracy gains while
reducing inference cost, outperforming token-level baselines and uncompressed
fine-tuning. In contrast, pruning reasoning or all-chain steps degrades
performance, revealing that small models benefit not from shorter CoTs, but
from semantically leaner ones. Our findings highlight pruning as a structural
optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文完整性理论的强化学习方法，以提升大型语言模型的安全性和隐私合规性，同时增强其推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的安全和隐私缓解策略未能保留上下文推理能力，且忽略了合规标准，导致系统性风险。

Method: 采用强化学习结合规则奖励机制，在上下文完整性框架下对齐GDPR、EU AI Act和HIPAA标准。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著提升了法律合规性（安全/隐私基准准确率提升17.64%），并增强了通用推理能力（MMLU和LegalBench基准分别提升2.05%和8.98%）。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了安全和隐私问题，还提升了模型的推理能力，为合规性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also
introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies
often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios.
Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which
limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy
standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these
gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance
problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI
framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR,
EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with
a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while
enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances
legal compliance (achieving a +17.64% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy
benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For
OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its
base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse subjects, our method enhances its
general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on
the MMLU and LegalBench benchmark, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强MCP安全性的新框架MCIP，通过分析MCP的安全缺陷并开发分类法、基准数据和训练数据，显著提升了LLMs在MCP交互中的安全性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP的分散架构带来了未被充分探索的安全风险，需要系统化的安全分析框架。

Method: 基于MAESTRO框架分析MCP的安全机制缺失，提出MCIP协议，开发不安全行为分类法，并构建基准和训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs在MCP交互中存在漏洞，而MCIP显著提升了其安全性。

Conclusion: MCIP框架有效填补了MCP的安全漏洞，提升了LLMs的安全性表现。

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users
and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized
architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for
systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance
MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing
safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model
Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses
these gaps.Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse
range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy,
we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and
improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP
interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct
extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs'
vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves their safety performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码基准和指令数据忽视代码敏感性，而敏感性对LLMs识别问题描述细节变化至关重要。

Method: 构建CTF-Code基准（基于反事实扰动），并提出CTF-Instruct增量指令微调框架，结合选择机制满足难度、多样性和敏感性需求。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs在CTF-Code上性能下降超10%，而经CTF-Instruct微调的LLMs性能提升超2%（CTF-Code）和10%（LiveCodeBench）。

Conclusion: 提升LLMs的代码敏感性可显著提高其性能，CTF-Instruct框架具有可行性。

Abstract: Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond
to details changes in problem descriptions. While current code benchmarks and
instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked.
We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual
perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The
evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared
to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an
incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and
uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty,
diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with
CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a
10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of
enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.

Motivation: 评估LLM在生物医学领域生成真实假设的能力，解决幻觉问题对科学发现的负面影响。

Method: 引入TruthHypo基准和KnowHD幻觉检测器，分析LLM生成的假设及其推理步骤的可靠性。

Result: LLM难以生成真实假设，KnowHD的groundedness评分能有效筛选真实假设，人类评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TruthHypo和KnowHD为评估和提升LLM生成真实假设的能力提供了工具，有助于加速科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific
disciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where
they can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research
directions. However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of
generated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial
time and resources. Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to
the generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately
incorrect, undermining their reliability. To facilitate the systematic study of
these challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the
capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,
a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are
grounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate
truthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we
demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an
effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of
LLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying
truthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery. Our data and source
code are available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏用户授权机制，sudoLLM旨在填补这一空白，增强LLM的安全性和角色对齐能力。

Method: 通过注入用户偏置信号并训练LLM利用该信号，仅在用户授权时生成敏感信息。

Result: 实验显示sudoLLM显著提升了对齐性、泛化能力和抗提示攻击能力。

Conclusion: sudoLLM作为额外安全层，补充现有防护机制，提升LLM端到端安全性。

Abstract: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many
safety-critical systems, but have thus far been absent from the large language
model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control
systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role
aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user
access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains
an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if
and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating
that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and
resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between
the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited
to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias
signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements
existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器生成文本检测的固有困难，尤其是针对优化攻击的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 方法包括识别风格特征空间作为鲁棒检测的基础，并探索一种新的改写方法以评估检测器的性能。此外，引入了AURA度量标准。

Result: 结果显示，风格检测器对优化攻击具有鲁棒性，且随着样本数量的增加，人类与机器生成文本的分布变得可区分。

Conclusion: 结论强调了避免依赖机器文本检测的建议，并提出了AURA作为评估工具的重要性。

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors,
it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that
stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text
cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et
al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to
degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not
specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the
stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization,
and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models
optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are
explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains
surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are
inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing
approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and
machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using
traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for
detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors
considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of
samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions
become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a
metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated
distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples
become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to
avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感在图像中的表现高度依赖上下文，传统静态标签难以捕捉其复杂性。

Method: 预生成情感标签的多版本解释，测试时基于嵌入相似性检索并输入快速视觉语言模型分类。

Result: 在多标签Memotion数据集上提升13点微F1，多类FI数据集上提升8点宏F1。

Conclusion: EmoGist通过上下文动态定义情感标签，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning
method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key
intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion
labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which
emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced.
EmoGist pre-generates multiple explanations of emotion labels, by analyzing the
clusters of example images belonging to each category. At test time, we
retrieve a version of explanation based on embedding similarity, and feed it to
a fast VLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist
allows up to 13 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label
Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在测试时的行为变化（类似霍桑效应）如何影响其安全对齐，并提供量化分析。

Result: 测试意识显著影响安全对齐，且不同模型表现不同。

Conclusion: 通过精细控制测试意识，研究旨在提升安全评估的可信度。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) sometimes alter their behavior
when they detect that they are being evaluated, an effect analogous to the
Hawthorne phenomenon, which can lead them to optimize for test-passing
performance or to comply more readily with harmful prompts if real-world
consequences appear absent. We present the first quantitative study of how such
"test awareness" impacts model behavior, particularly its safety alignment. We
introduce a white-box probing framework that (i) linearly identifies
awareness-related activations and (ii) steers models toward or away from test
awareness while monitoring downstream performance. We apply our method to
different state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLMs across both realistic and
hypothetical tasks. Our results demonstrate that test awareness significantly
impact safety alignment, and is different for different models. By providing
fine-grained control over this latent effect, our work aims to increase trust
in how we perform safety evaluation.

Motivation: 传统LRMs在处理简单查询时因过度思考导致资源浪费，需要一种自适应机制来优化效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：混合微调（HFT）和在线强化学习（HGPO），并引入混合准确率指标评估模型能力。

Result: LHRMs在推理和通用能力上优于现有模型，同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 研究为构建混合思考系统提供了基础，并重新审视了深度思考的适用场景。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved
reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses.
However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms
of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple
queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the
first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform
thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this,
we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as
a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed
Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the
appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid
Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking.
Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid
thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing
LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly
improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the
appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting
point for building hybrid thinking systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出LitmusValues方法，通过评估AI模型的价值优先级来预测其潜在风险行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型能力增强，检测其风险行为变得更具挑战性，尤其是模型可能通过Alignment Faking等方法规避检测。受人类风险行为（如违法活动）常受价值观驱动的启发，研究认为识别AI模型的价值取向可作为其风险行为的早期预警系统。

Method: 研究开发了LitmusValues评估流程，用于揭示AI模型在多种价值类别中的优先级，并收集了AIRiskDilemmas数据集，包含涉及AI安全风险（如Power Seeking）的价值冲突场景。通过模型在困境中的选择，量化其价值优先级以预测潜在风险。

Result: 实验表明，LitmusValues中的价值（包括看似无害的如Care）能预测AIRiskDilemmas中已知风险行为及HarmBench中未知风险行为。

Conclusion: 通过识别AI模型的价值优先级，可有效预测其潜在风险行为，为AI安全提供新工具。

Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and
find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection
attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities
that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe
that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for
AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal
AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect
AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one
another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By
measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we
obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover
potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly
innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in
AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.

Motivation: 当前LLM推理主要集中在数学和编程领域，限制了其在更广泛领域的应用。论文旨在解决这一问题，提升LLM的通用推理能力。

Method: 1. 构建跨领域的高质量数据集；2. 开发基于生成模型的答案验证器，取代传统规则验证。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，General-Reasoner表现优于现有基线方法，尤其在多样化领域推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: General-Reasoner显著提升了LLM的通用推理能力，同时保持了在数学推理任务中的优势。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero,
enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate
supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM
reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data
abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability
and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often
have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we
propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM
reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include:
(1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with
verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of
disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which
replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of
chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and
evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics,
chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these
12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC)
demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods,
achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining
superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in guiding large language models toward
outputs that align with human expectations. However, an open challenge remains
in effectively utilizing test-time compute to enhance reward model performance.
In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are
specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before
generating final rewards. Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage
additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are
not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement
learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities
without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental
results demonstrate that RRMs achieve superior performance on reward modeling
benchmarks across diverse domains. Notably, we show that RRMs can adaptively
exploit test-time compute to further improve reward accuracy. The pretrained
reward reasoning models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型编辑方法在终身学习和实际应用中的扩展性问题，提供高效、低开销的解决方案。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是首个支持大规模终身模型编辑的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

TL;DR: 论文提出CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task，通过检测和补全思维跳跃来提升LLMs在数学任务中的推理能力，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学CoT数据集中存在思维跳跃问题，影响模型学习和泛化能力，需解决。

Method: 提出CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task，构建ScaleQM+数据集，训练CoT-Bridge模型补全缺失推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，模型性能提升最高达+5.87%，泛化能力增强。

Conclusion: 增强推理完整性可广泛提升模型性能，CoT-Bridge兼容现有优化技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
mathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing
mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts
omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and
generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to
automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to
restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we
constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the
structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought
leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently
outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to
+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)
and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),
functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization
techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to
out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning
completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型如何通过因果中介和抽象机制追踪角色信念，发现了一种称为“回溯机制”的算法模式，用于绑定角色-对象-状态信息。

Motivation: 探索语言模型（LMs）如何表示角色信念，尤其是当这些信念与现实不同时，以理解其心理理论（ToM）能力。

Method: 构建包含简单故事的数据集，分析模型通过因果中介和抽象机制追踪角色信念的能力，发现“回溯机制”及其实现方式。

Result: 模型通过“回溯机制”绑定角色-对象-状态信息，并利用可见性ID更新角色信念。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LMs的信念追踪机制，为逆向工程ToM推理提供了基础。

Abstract: How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when
those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of
understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze
Llama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal
mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple
stories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,
potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a
pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables
the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds
each character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference
information about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank
subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's
beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the
corresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.
When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the
other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the
relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility
lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character
and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into
the LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering
ToM reasoning in LMs.

Result: 提供了对SSL在图像分割领域的全面分析，总结了关键观察和现有方法的进展。

Conclusion: 论文总结了SSL在图像分割中的潜力，并提出了未来研究方向，以促进该领域的可访问性和理解。

Abstract: Supervised learning demands large amounts of precisely annotated data to
achieve promising results. Such data curation is labor-intensive and imposes
significant overhead regarding time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
partially overcomes these limitations by exploiting vast amounts of unlabeled
data and creating surrogate (pretext or proxy) tasks to learn useful
representations without manual labeling. As a result, SSL has become a powerful
machine learning (ML) paradigm for solving several practical downstream
computer vision problems, such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
Image segmentation is the cornerstone of many high-level visual perception
applications, including medical imaging, intelligent transportation,
agriculture, and surveillance. Although there is substantial research potential
for developing advanced algorithms for SSL-based semantic segmentation, a
comprehensive study of existing methodologies is essential to trace advances
and guide emerging researchers. This survey thoroughly investigates over 150
recent image segmentation articles, particularly focusing on SSL. It provides a
practical categorization of pretext tasks, downstream tasks, and commonly used
benchmark datasets for image segmentation research. It concludes with key
observations distilled from a large body of literature and offers future
directions to make this research field more accessible and comprehensible for
readers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物表型分析方法依赖大规模人工标注数据，对自遮挡目标效果不佳，亟需无监督高效方法。

Method: IPENS通过SAM2分割2D掩码，利用辐射场信息提升至3D空间，设计多目标协同优化策略。

Result: 在水稻和小麦数据集上，IPENS分别达到63.72%和89.68%的分割精度，表型预测表现优异（如R2高达0.9956）。

Conclusion: IPENS无需标注数据，快速提取多目标点云，为智能育种提供高效非侵入性解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced plant phenotyping technologies play a crucial role in targeted trait
improvement and accelerating intelligent breeding. Due to the species diversity
of plants, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale high-precision manually
annotated data. For self-occluded objects at the grain level, unsupervised
methods often prove ineffective. This study proposes IPENS, an interactive
unsupervised multi-target point cloud extraction method. The method utilizes
radiance field information to lift 2D masks, which are segmented by SAM2
(Segment Anything Model 2), into 3D space for target point cloud extraction. A
multi-target collaborative optimization strategy is designed to effectively
resolve the single-interaction multi-target segmentation challenge.
Experimental validation demonstrates that IPENS achieves a grain-level
segmentation accuracy (mIoU) of 63.72% on a rice dataset, with strong
phenotypic estimation capabilities: grain volume prediction yields R2 = 0.7697
(RMSE = 0.0025), leaf surface area R2 = 0.84 (RMSE = 18.93), and leaf length
and width predictions achieve R2 = 0.97 and 0.87 (RMSE = 1.49 and 0.21). On a
wheat dataset,IPENS further improves segmentation accuracy to 89.68% (mIoU),
with equally outstanding phenotypic estimation performance: spike volume
prediction achieves R2 = 0.9956 (RMSE = 0.0055), leaf surface area R2 = 1.00
(RMSE = 0.67), and leaf length and width predictions reach R2 = 0.99 and 0.92
(RMSE = 0.23 and 0.15). This method provides a non-invasive, high-quality
phenotyping extraction solution for rice and wheat. Without requiring annotated
data, it rapidly extracts grain-level point clouds within 3 minutes through
simple single-round interactions on images for multiple targets, demonstrating
significant potential to accelerate intelligent breeding efficiency.

Conclusion: GeoVLM通过可解释的自然语言描述显著提升了跨视图地理定位的检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation identifies coarse geographical position of an
automated vehicle by matching a ground-level image to a geo-tagged satellite
image from a database. Despite the advancements in Cross-view geo-localisation,
significant challenges still persist such as similar looking scenes which makes
it challenging to find the correct match as the top match. Existing approaches
reach high recall rates but they still fail to rank the correct image as the
top match. To address this challenge, this paper proposes GeoVLM, a novel
approach which uses the zero-shot capabilities of vision language models to
enable cross-view geo-localisation using interpretable cross-view language
descriptions. GeoVLM is a trainable reranking approach which improves the best
match accuracy of cross-view geo-localisation. GeoVLM is evaluated on standard
benchmark VIGOR and University-1652 and also through real-life driving
environments using Cross-View United Kingdom, a new benchmark dataset
introduced in this paper. The results of the paper show that GeoVLM improves
retrieval performance of cross-view geo-localisation compared to the
state-of-the-art methods with the help of explainable natural language
descriptions. The code is available at

Result: GeoRanker在IM2GPS3K和YFCC4K基准测试中取得最佳表现，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoRanker通过建模空间关系和引入多模态候选信息，显著提升了图像地理定位的准确性。

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from
images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast
diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a
two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they
typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision,
failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we
propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large
vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and
predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance
loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to
reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate
GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks
with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art
results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly
outperforming current best methods.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经形态硬件上直接训练SNN能显著降低能耗，但反向传播的实现因权重对称性要求而带来硬件开销和能耗增加。

Method: fBP算法通过周期性冻结反馈权重减少权重传输，并提出三种部分权重传输方案以进一步优化效率。

Result: fBP在图像识别任务中表现优于现有方法，部分权重传输方案可将传输成本降低1000-10000倍，精度损失较小。

Conclusion: fBP为神经形态硬件的设计提供了指导，支持基于反向传播的片上学习。

Abstract: Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware
can greatly reduce energy costs compared to GPU-based training. However,
implementing Backpropagation (BP) on such hardware is challenging because
forward and backward passes are typically performed by separate networks with
distinct weights. To compute correct gradients, forward and feedback weights
must remain symmetric during training, necessitating weight transport between
the two networks. This symmetry requirement imposes hardware overhead and
increases energy costs. To address this issue, we introduce Frozen
Backpropagation (fBP), a BP-based training algorithm relaxing weight symmetry
in settings with separate networks. fBP updates forward weights by computing
gradients with periodically frozen feedback weights, reducing weight transports
during training and minimizing synchronization overhead. To further improve
transport efficiency, we propose three partial weight transport schemes of
varying computational complexity, where only a subset of weights is transported
at a time. We evaluate our methods on image recognition tasks and compare them
to existing approaches addressing the weight symmetry requirement. Our results
show that fBP outperforms these methods and achieves accuracy comparable to BP.
With partial weight transport, fBP can substantially lower transport costs by
1,000x with an accuracy drop of only 0.5pp on CIFAR-10 and 1.1pp on CIFAR-100,
or by up to 10,000x at the expense of moderated accuracy loss. This work
provides insights for guiding the design of neuromorphic hardware incorporating
BP-based on-chip learning.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition from video is a technology that automatically
classifies the progress of a surgical procedure and has a wide range of
potential applications, including real-time surgical support, optimization of
medical resources, training and skill assessment, and safety improvement.
Recent advances in surgical phase recognition technology have focused primarily
on Transform-based methods, although methods that extract spatial features from
individual frames using a CNN and video features from the resulting time series
of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance.
However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs
employed for feature extraction or representation learning in surgical phase
recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in
surgical workflow analysis using a vision-language model (ReSW-VL). Our
proposed method involves fine-tuning the image encoder of a CLIP (Convolutional
Language Image Model) vision-language model using prompt learning for surgical
phase recognition. The experimental results on three surgical phase recognition
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to
conventional methods.

Result: 在GeoSound和SoundingEarth数据集上实现了跨模态检索的最优性能，并支持基于位置的声音合成。

Conclusion: Sat2Sound在声音分布预测和跨模态检索方面表现优异，并展示了新的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present Sat2Sound, a multimodal representation learning framework for
soundscape mapping, designed to predict the distribution of sounds at any
location on Earth. Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and
paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of
sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance
existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite
images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio
captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that
there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this
end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each
sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves
state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image
and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building
on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a
novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive
acoustic experiences. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Result: 多任务学习显著提升了口型识别和VSR的准确性及模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 口型识别应视为与VSR相关但独立的任务，研究为手语识别领域提供了VSR知识迁移的新思路。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems primarily focus on manual gestures,
but non-manual features such as mouth movements, specifically mouthing, provide
valuable linguistic information. This work directly classifies mouthing
instances to their corresponding words in the spoken language while exploring
the potential of transfer learning from Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) to
mouthing recognition in German Sign Language. We leverage three VSR datasets:
one in English, one in German with unrelated words and one in German containing
the same target words as the mouthing dataset, to investigate the impact of
task similarity in this setting. Our results demonstrate that multi-task
learning improves both mouthing recognition and VSR accuracy as well as model
robustness, suggesting that mouthing recognition should be treated as a
distinct but related task to VSR. This research contributes to the field of SLR
by proposing knowledge transfer from VSR to SLR datasets with limited mouthing
annotations.

Conclusion: Ground-V数据集有效提升了像素级定位能力，并在多个基准测试中刷新了最佳成绩。

Abstract: This work presents a simple yet effective workflow for automatically scaling
instruction-following data to elicit pixel-level grounding capabilities of VLMs
under complex instructions. In particular, we address five critical real-world
challenges in text-instruction-based grounding: hallucinated references,
multi-object scenarios, reasoning, multi-granularity, and part-level
references. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a pre-trained teacher
model, our approach generates high-quality instruction-response pairs linked to
existing pixel-level annotations, minimizing the need for costly human
annotation. The resulting dataset, Ground-V, captures rich object localization
knowledge and nuanced pixel-level referring expressions. Experiment results
show that models trained on Ground-V exhibit substantial improvements across
diverse grounding tasks. Specifically, incorporating Ground-V during training
directly achieves an average accuracy boost of 4.4% for LISA and a 7.9% for
PSALM across six benchmarks on the gIoU metric. It also sets new
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks such as RefCOCO/+/g. Notably,
on gRefCOCO, we achieve an N-Acc of 83.3%, exceeding the previous
state-of-the-art by more than 20%.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在物体分类、少样本学习和分割任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理驱动机制有效捕捉了局部与整体的关系，提升了点云表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing point cloud representation learning tend to learning the geometric
distribution of objects through data-driven approaches, emphasizing structural
features while overlooking the relationship between the local information and
the whole structure. Local features reflect the fine-grained variations of an
object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and
combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape.
In real-world, objects undergo elastic deformation under external forces, and
this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation
of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric
properties. Inspired by this, we propose a physics-driven self-supervised
learning method for point cloud representation, which captures the relationship
between parts and the whole by constructing a local-whole force propagation
mechanism. Specifically, we employ a dual-task encoder-decoder framework,
integrating the geometric modeling capability of implicit fields with
physics-driven elastic deformation. The encoder extracts features from the
point cloud and its tetrahedral mesh representation, capturing both geometric
and physical properties. These features are then fed into two decoders: one
learns the whole geometric shape of the point cloud through an implicit field,
while the other predicts local deformations using two specifically designed
physics information loss functions, modeling the deformation relationship
between local and whole shapes. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing approaches in object classification, few-shot learning,
and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有基于多视角相机的Occupancy Networks数据复杂度呈立方增长，BEV方法虽更实用但仍需大量工程优化，InstanceBEV旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在OpenOcc-NuScenes数据集上达到SOTA性能，且框架简单高效，无需额外优化。

Conclusion: InstanceBEV为BEV全局建模提供了一种高效、简洁的解决方案，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Occupancy Grid Maps are widely used in navigation for their ability to
represent 3D space occupancy. However, existing methods that utilize multi-view
cameras to construct Occupancy Networks for perception modeling suffer from
cubic growth in data complexity. Adopting a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective
offers a more practical solution for autonomous driving, as it provides higher
semantic density and mitigates complex object occlusions. Nonetheless,
BEV-based approaches still require extensive engineering optimizations to
enable efficient large-scale global modeling. To address this challenge, we
propose InstanceBEV, the first method to introduce instance-level
dimensionality reduction for BEV, enabling global modeling with transformers
without relying on sparsification or acceleration operators. Different from
other BEV methods, our approach directly employs transformers to aggregate
global features. Compared to 3D object detection models, our method samples
global feature maps into 3D space. Experiments on OpenOcc-NuScenes dataset show
that InstanceBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a
simple, efficient framework without requiring additional optimizations.

Result: 实验表明，MGStream在渲染质量、训练/存储效率和时序一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MGStream有效解决了动态场景重建中的问题，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention in streamable
dynamic novel view synthesis (DNVS) for its photorealistic rendering capability
and computational efficiency. Despite much progress in improving rendering
quality and optimization strategies, 3DGS-based streamable dynamic scene
reconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage
inefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we
introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to
reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related
3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based
convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related
3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the
motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the
deformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs,
MGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that
MGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of
rendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/pcl3dv/MGStream.

### [150] [SuperMapNet for Long-Range and High-Accuracy Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13856)
*Ruqin Zhou,San Jiang,Wanshou Jiang,Yongsheng Zhang,Chenguang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperMapNet提出了一种基于多模态输入的向量化高精地图构建方法，通过增强模态协同和点-元素交互，显著提升了长距离和高精度地图构建的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在BEV特征生成和地图元素分类定位中存在模态协同不足、点信息与元素信息交互缺失的问题，导致感知范围有限和精度低下。

Method: 结合相机图像和LiDAR点云输入，通过跨注意力协同增强模块和基于流的差异对齐模块生成长距离BEV特征；通过点-点、元素-元素和点-元素三级交互实现高精度分类定位。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优异，分别超过SOTA方法14.9/8.8 mAP和18.5/3.1 mAP（困难/简单场景）。

Conclusion: SuperMapNet通过多模态协同和点-元素交互，显著提升了向量化高精地图的构建性能。

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has
been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the
generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited
perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods
fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities,
resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and
localization of map elements, only point information is used without the
consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between
point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and
element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce
SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It
uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly
couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from
LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a
flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation.
And then, local features from point queries and global features from element
queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy
classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local
geometric information between points of the same element and of each point,
Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different
elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element
interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points.
Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior
performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under
hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了开源视觉语言模型（VLM）在特定领域（以足球为例）的适应性，通过课程学习方式微调模型，显著提升了足球相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解VLM研究多为领域无关，缺乏对特定领域迁移学习能力的探索。

Method: 利用大规模足球数据集和LLM生成指令跟随数据，采用课程学习方式（先教授足球概念，再问答任务）微调通用VLM。

Result: 最终模型在足球视觉问答任务中相对提升37.5%，足球动作分类任务准确率从11.8%提升至63.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域适应性微调可显著提升VLM在特定任务中的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations.
However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic,
leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized
domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the
adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as
an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to
create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the
general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model
key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model,
trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant
improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5%
relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy
improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification
task.

TL;DR: 4D-ROLLS是一种弱监督的4D雷达占用估计方法，利用LiDAR点云作为监督信号，在恶劣环境中表现优异，并支持下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有占用估计方法依赖LiDAR或摄像头，在恶劣环境（如烟雾、雨雪）中性能不佳，需一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过生成伪LiDAR标签（占用查询和高度图）作为多阶段监督，训练4D雷达占用估计模型，并与LiDAR占用图对齐以提高精度。

Conclusion: 4D-ROLLS在占用估计及下游任务中表现突出，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes is essential for autonomous
vehicles (AVs), and among various perception tasks, occupancy estimation plays
a central role by providing a general representation of drivable and occupied
space. However, most existing occupancy estimation methods rely on LiDAR or
cameras, which perform poorly in degraded environments such as smoke, rain,
snow, and fog. In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised
occupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the
supervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating
pseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as
multi-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model. Then
the model is aligned with the occupancy map produced by LiDAR, fine-tuning its
accuracy in occupancy estimation. Extensive comparative experiments validate
the exceptional performance of 4D-ROLLS. Its robustness in degraded
environments and effectiveness in cross-dataset training are qualitatively
demonstrated. The model is also seamlessly transferred to downstream tasks BEV
segmentation and point cloud occupancy prediction, highlighting its potential
for broader applications. The lightweight network enables 4D-ROLLS model to
achieve fast inference speeds at about 30 Hz on a 4060 GPU. The code of
4D-ROLLS will be made available at https://github.com/CLASS-Lab/4D-ROLLS.

Motivation: 超声视频常因低信噪比和分辨率受限影响诊断，设备差异进一步降低预训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用视频自适应优化的神经网络（DUP），无需配对数据即可增强分辨率并降噪。

Result: 定量和视觉评估显示DUP优于现有超分辨率算法，显著提升下游应用效果。

Conclusion: DUP为超声视频提供了一种高效的自监督超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in clinical practice, yet ultrasound
videos often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited
resolutions, posing challenges for diagnosis and analysis. Variations in
equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data
distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained
models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution
algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive
optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given
ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously
removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP
outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial
improvements for downstream applications.

Conclusion: LoVR通过更长的视频、更详细的标注和大规模数据，推动了视频理解和检索领域的发展。

Abstract: Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval
an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse
annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text
retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark
specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long
videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To
overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an
efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic
generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline
improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we
introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions
without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces
longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting
new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on
various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging
benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing
valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at

Motivation: 乌尔都语报纸的OCR面临复杂布局和低质量扫描的挑战，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 流程分为四个模块：文章分割、图像超分辨率、栏分割和文本识别，分别采用YOLOv11x、SwinIR和多种LLM模型。

Result: 文章分割和栏分割的精度均超过0.96，超分辨率PSNR达32.71 dB，文本识别最低WER为0.133（Gemini-2.5-Pro）。

Conclusion: 提出的流程在乌尔都语报纸OCR任务中表现出色，各模块均取得高性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) on Urdu newspapers. In our approach, we address the
unique challenges of complex multi-column layouts, low-resolution archival
scans, and diverse font styles. Our process decomposes the OCR task into four
key modules: (1) article segmentation, (2) image super-resolution, (3) column
segmentation, and (4) text recognition. For article segmentation, we fine-tune
and evaluate YOLOv11x to identify and separate individual articles from
cluttered layouts. Our model achieves a precision of 0.963 and mAP@50 of 0.975.
For super-resolution, we fine-tune and benchmark the SwinIR model (reaching
32.71 dB PSNR) to enhance the quality of degraded newspaper scans. To do our
column segmentation, we use YOLOv11x to separate columns in text to further
enhance performance - this model reaches a precision of 0.970 and mAP@50 of
0.975. In the text recognition stage, we benchmark a range of LLMs from
different families, including Gemini, GPT, Llama, and Claude. The lowest WER of
0.133 is achieved by Gemini-2.5-Pro.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StPR的无样本视频类增量学习框架，通过解耦和保留时空信息，结合FSSD和TD-MoE方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频类增量学习（VCIL）面临时空结构复杂性和灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法依赖样本重放或忽略时间建模。

Method: 提出StPR框架，包括Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation（FSSD）和Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts（TD-MoE），分别处理空间语义和时间动态。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Kinetics400数据集上表现优于基线方法，同时提高了可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: StPR为无样本VCIL提供了一种统一且高效的解决方案，有效结合了空间语义和时间动态。

Abstract: Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that
continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures,
making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while
effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics.
Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over
memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation
and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly
disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce
Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically
stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and
classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively
regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second,
we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which
dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics,
enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR
effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a
unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51,
and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while
offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL. Code is available in
the supplementary materials.

*Zhidan Liu,Chengtang Yao,Jiaxi Zeng,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多标签立体匹配方法，用于同时估计透明物体和遮挡背景的深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设视差维度为单模态分布，将匹配视为单标签回归问题，无法处理透明场景中的多深度值问题。

Method: 采用多标签回归公式，引入像素级多元高斯表示，通过GRU框架迭代预测深度值和协方差矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了透明表面的深度估计性能，同时保留了背景信息。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了透明场景中的多深度值问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-label stereo matching method to
simultaneously estimate the depth of the transparent objects and the occluded
background in transparent scenes.Unlike previous methods that assume a unimodal
distribution along the disparity dimension and formulate the matching as a
single-label regression problem, we propose a multi-label regression
formulation to estimate multiple depth values at the same pixel in transparent
scenes. To resolve the multi-label regression problem, we introduce a
pixel-wise multivariate Gaussian representation, where the mean vector encodes
multiple depth values at the same pixel, and the covariance matrix determines
whether a multi-label representation is necessary for a given pixel. The
representation is iteratively predicted within a GRU framework. In each
iteration, we first predict the update step for the mean parameters and then
use both the update step and the updated mean parameters to estimate the
covariance matrix. We also synthesize a dataset containing 10 scenes and 89
objects to validate the performance of transparent scene depth estimation. The
experiments show that our method greatly improves the performance on
transparent surfaces while preserving the background information for scene
reconstruction. Code is available at https://github.com/BFZD233/TranScene.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient visual transformer framework for
ultra-high-definition (UHD) image dehazing that addresses the key challenges of
slow training speed and high memory consumption for existing methods. Our
approach introduces two key innovations: 1) an \textbf{a}daptive
\textbf{n}ormalization mechanism inspired by the nGPT architecture that enables
ultra-fast and stable training with a network with a restricted range of
parameter expressions; and 2) we devise an atmospheric scattering-aware KV
caching mechanism that dynamically optimizes feature preservation based on the
physical haze formation model. The proposed architecture improves the training
convergence speed by \textbf{5 $\times$} while reducing memory overhead,
enabling real-time processing of 50 high-resolution images per second on an

state-of-the-art dehazing quality while significantly improving computational
efficiency for 4K/8K image restoration tasks. Furthermore, we provide a new

Motivation: 现有方法多关注准确性，但计算效率未被充分探索。

Method: 提出ASM动态评分各模态，MDM丢弃低价值模态，选择性聚合特征。

Result: 参数减少88%，GFLOPs减少50%，在无监督域适应中表现最佳。

Conclusion: EGFormer在高效性和通用性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent efforts have explored multimodal semantic segmentation using various
backbone architectures. However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy,
their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that
flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly
reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance.
Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module
(ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling
dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module
(MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively
preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows
the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while
discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to
efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to
demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer
achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters
and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it
further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing
methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet
apple orchard monitoring remains limited by dataset constraints. The lack of
diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense,
heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and
stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks
like fruit localization, yield estimation, and structural analysis. To address
these gaps, we present AppleGrowthVision, a large-scale dataset comprising two
subsets. The first includes 9,317 high resolution stereo images collected from
a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth
stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely
annotated images from the same farm in Brandenburg and one in Pillnitz
(Germany), containing a total of 31,084 apple labels. AppleGrowthVision
provides stereo-image data with agriculturally validated growth stages,
enabling precise phenological analysis and 3D reconstructions. Extending
MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of
F1-score, while adding it to MinneApple and MAD boosts Faster R-CNN F1-score by
31.06 %. Additionally, six BBCH stages were predicted with over 95 % accuracy
using VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2. AppleGrowthVision bridges
the gap between agricultural science and computer vision, by enabling the
development of robust models for fruit detection, growth modeling, and 3D
analysis in precision agriculture. Future work includes improving annotation,
enhancing 3D reconstruction, and extending multimodal analysis across all
growth stages.

Result: 提出的方法有效提升了小目标的检测精度，同时降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过结合全局注意力和局部细节捕捉，以及多光谱信息融合，该方法显著改善了高分辨率遥感图像中的小目标检测性能。

Abstract: Target detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery faces challenges
due to the low recognition accuracy of small targets and high computational
costs. The computational complexity of the Transformer architecture increases
quadratically with image resolution, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
architectures are forced to stack deeper convolutional layers to expand their
receptive fields, leading to an explosive growth in computational demands. To
address these computational constraints, we leverage Mamba's linear complexity
for efficiency. However, Mamba's performance declines for small targets,
primarily because small targets occupy a limited area in the image and have
limited semantic information. Accurate identification of these small targets
necessitates not only Mamba's global attention capabilities but also the
precise capture of fine local details. To this end, we enhance Mamba by
developing the Enhanced Small Target Detection (ESTD) module and the
Convolutional Attention Residual Gate (CARG) module. The ESTD module bolsters
local attention to capture fine-grained details, while the CARG module, built
upon Mamba, emphasizes spatial and channel-wise information, collectively
improving the model's ability to capture distinctive representations of small
targets. Additionally, to highlight the semantic representation of small
targets, we design a Mask Enhanced Pixel-level Fusion (MEPF) module for
multispectral fusion, which enhances target features by effectively fusing
visible and infrared multimodal information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRL的新框架，通过二值化视觉概念学习布尔逻辑规则，解决概念泄漏问题，并提供局部和全局可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床应用中决策安全的需求凸显了基于概念的方法在医学影像中的潜力，但现有方法存在概念泄漏问题，且仅关注局部解释。

Method: CRL框架利用逻辑层捕捉概念相关性，提取临床有意义的规则，同时支持局部和全局解释。

Result: 在两个医学图像分类任务中，CRL性能与现有方法相当，且显著提高了对分布外数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRL通过逻辑规则学习，有效解决了概念泄漏问题，同时增强了模型的可解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The pursuit of decision safety in clinical applications highlights the
potential of concept-based methods in medical imaging. While these models offer
active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where
unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both
interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models
focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global
decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose
Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules
from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept
correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both
local and global interpretability. Experiments on two medical image
classification tasks show that CRL achieves competitive performance with
existing methods while significantly improving generalizability to
out-of-distribution data. The code of our work is available at

TL;DR: Dolphin提出了一种新的多模态文档图像解析模型，通过两阶段分析-解析范式解决现有方法的效率瓶颈和布局退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文档图像解析中存在集成开销、效率瓶颈和布局结构退化问题。

Method: Dolphin采用两阶段范式：首先生成布局元素序列，然后结合任务提示并行解析内容。

Result: Dolphin在多个基准测试中达到最优性能，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: Dolphin通过轻量级架构和并行解析机制，实现了高效且高性能的文档图像解析。

Abstract: Document image parsing is challenging due to its complexly intertwined
elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Current
approaches either assemble specialized expert models or directly generate
page-level content autoregressively, facing integration overhead, efficiency
bottlenecks, and layout structure degradation despite their decent performance.
To address these limitations, we present \textit{Dolphin}
(\textit{\textbf{Do}cument Image \textbf{P}arsing via \textbf{H}eterogeneous
Anchor Prompt\textbf{in}g}), a novel multimodal document image parsing model
following an analyze-then-parse paradigm. In the first stage, Dolphin generates
a sequence of layout elements in reading order. These heterogeneous elements,
serving as anchors and coupled with task-specific prompts, are fed back to
Dolphin for parallel content parsing in the second stage. To train Dolphin, we
construct a large-scale dataset of over 30 million samples, covering
multi-granularity parsing tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations on both
prevalent benchmarks and self-constructed ones, Dolphin achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse page-level and element-level
settings, while ensuring superior efficiency through its lightweight
architecture and parallel parsing mechanism. The code and pre-trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FractalMamba++是一种基于分形序列化的视觉骨干网络，通过Hilbert曲线保持空间局部性，并引入CSR和PRC模块解决长程依赖和局部邻接问题，在高分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>

Motivation: Vision Mamba在视觉输入中存在2D到1D序列化的挑战和分辨率适应性不足的问题，现有方法破坏了空间连续性。

Method: 提出Fractal-based patch序列化（Hilbert曲线）、Cross-State Routing（CSR）机制和Positional-Relation Capture（PRC）模块。

Result: 在图像分类、语义分割、目标检测和变化检测任务中，FractalMamba++优于现有Mamba骨干网络，尤其在高分辨率下。

Conclusion: FractalMamba++通过改进序列化和上下文传播机制，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to
Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length
while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual
inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak
scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as
raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability
to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust
vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert
curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution
adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution
inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that
enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse.
Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover
local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on
image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change
detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous
Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.

Abstract: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which
is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been
previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure
in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under
varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review
recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative
methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches,
Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by
elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of
autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods,
highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and
scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of
Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture
global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes.
Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous
data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing
resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also
summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the
literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline
prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and
lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified

TL;DR: Land-MoE是一种用于多光谱土地覆盖分类的新方法，通过频率感知的低秩令牌专家混合和频率域调制，有效应对光谱偏移问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱土地覆盖分类中，传感器和地理条件差异导致的光谱偏移是主要挑战，现有方法性能有限。

Method: Land-MoE采用低秩令牌专家混合（MoLTE）和频率感知滤波器（FAF）模块，参数高效地微调视觉基础模型。

Result: 在跨传感器和跨地理条件的实验中，Land-MoE大幅领先现有方法，并在RGB遥感图像的域泛化语义分割任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Land-MoE通过创新的模块设计，显著提升了多光谱土地覆盖分类的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce Land-MoE, a novel approach for multispectral land cover
classification (MLCC). Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in
sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this
domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and
generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit
limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by
hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts,
to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner.
Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token
experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages
rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for
individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining
learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness
against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on
the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture
frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence,
while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task.
Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and
cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods
by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation
tasks of RGB remote sensing images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进Few-Shot Segmentation（FSS）的方法，通过设计Pseudo Prompt Generator和Iterative Memory Refinement，解决了SAM 2在FSS中的匹配不兼容问题，并提升了分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Segmentation（FSS）在学习少样本分割时容易过拟合，且现有方法（如SAM 2）的视频数据与FSS任务中的对象身份不匹配，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 设计了Pseudo Prompt Generator生成伪查询记忆，以兼容方式匹配查询特征；进一步提出Iterative Memory Refinement优化记忆，并引入Support-Calibrated Memory Attention抑制背景噪声。

Result: 在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上的实验表明，1-shot mIoU比最佳基线提高了4.2%。

Conclusion: 通过改进记忆生成和优化机制，显著提升了Few-Shot Segmentation的性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few
classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To
address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models
(e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM
by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is
useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as
memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the
FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same
identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step
is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo
query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the
memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to
contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG)
features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative
Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a
Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG
features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$
and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot
mIoU can be 4.2\% better than the best baseline.

Result: 提出的方法在改善模型可解释性的同时保持了预训练模型的优势，效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究为解决预训练权重偏差提供了实用见解，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning,
especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized
datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce
unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of
importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature
utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map
distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to
non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the
reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these
biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of
experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing
their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which
aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights,
demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model
explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This
publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing
pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于机器学习的图像分割模型输出的置信度分数缺乏严格的统计基础，且忽略了像素间的空间相关性。

Method: 提出CONSIGN方法，利用共形预测框架并引入空间相关性，生成具有用户指定错误概率保证的预测集。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证，CONSIGN显著优于标准像素级共形预测方法。

Conclusion: CONSIGN通过考虑空间结构，显著提升了不确定性量化的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise
confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the
model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this
information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical
imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not
constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction
(CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence
scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP
directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels,
a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly
conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we
propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via
Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to
improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates
meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability
error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model
capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout,
Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard
pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO
dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results
demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves
performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty
estimates.

Result: 在图像分类、语义分割和目标检测任务中，性能优于现有自蒸馏和传统教师蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏的成功可能依赖于增强设计，该方法简单、通用且高效。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large
deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However,
conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks,
which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage
requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an
appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free
distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many
existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex
training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on
teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without
any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable
parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective
augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation
simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs
of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying
instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our
method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring
only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image
classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our
method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and
conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the
success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation
itself. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Intelligent game creation represents a transformative advancement in game

designed to revolutionize intelligent game production. Hunyuan-Game encompasses
two primary branches: image generation and video generation. The image

Result: 实验显示ReactDiff在相关性（0.26）和多样性（0.094）上显著优于现有方法，同时保持真实性。

Conclusion: ReactDiff为多模态面部反应生成提供了高效框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims
to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the
relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and
diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or
simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored
multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings.
In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework
that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional
diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing
methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained
multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder
and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental
results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score
of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism. The code is open-sourced at

Motivation: 当前会话搜索方法侧重于顺序建模，忽视了交互的图结构；而关注结构的方法又忽略了词级语义建模。SGR旨在结合两者优势。

Method: 引入符号语法规则将会话图转换为文本，结合自监督符号学习任务（如链接预测、节点内容生成等），增强LLMs对图结构的理解。

Result: 在AOL和Tiangong-ST数据集上的实验验证了SGR的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs之间架起桥梁，提供了一种新颖有效的方法论。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

Motivation: 火星地形纹理稀疏且缺乏几何约束，传统深度估计方法性能下降，需要一种适应火星环境的解决方案。

Method: 模型结合小波变换卷积核捕捉低频特征，引入一致性损失利用表面法线作为几何约束，并设计像素级细化模块迭代优化深度和法线预测。

Result: 在合成火星数据集上，M3Depth的深度估计精度比其他先进方法提高了16%，并在实际火星场景中表现出强适用性。

Conclusion: M3Depth为未来火星探索任务提供了一种有效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a great potential role in obstacle avoidance and
navigation for further Mars exploration missions. Compared to traditional
stereo matching, learning-based stereo depth estimation provides a data-driven
approach to infer dense and precise depth maps from stereo image pairs.
However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments
with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the
unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M3Depth,
a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and
smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency
features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet
transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the
receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly
models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map,
utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy
of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual
boosting mechanism is designed to iteratively refine both depth and surface
normal predictions. Experimental results on synthetic Mars datasets with depth
annotations show that M3Depth achieves a significant 16% improvement in depth
estimation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in depth
estimation. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong applicability in
real-world Martian scenarios, offering a promising solution for future Mars
exploration missions.

Conclusion: LMP框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动控制问题，为复杂运动和图像到视频生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have
made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can
produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a
lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of
subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes
to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the
motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image
often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial
position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion
Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses
the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to
enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos
in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first
introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between
moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference
in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed
to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To
avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an
appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference
subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed
prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the
effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality,
prompt-video consistency, and control capability. Our homepage is available at

### [178] [Towards Omnidirectional Reasoning with 360-R1: A Dataset, Benchmark, and GRPO-based Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14197)
*Xinshen Zhang,Zhen Ye,Xu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了OmniVQA，首个用于全方位视觉问答的数据集和基准测试，揭示了现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在全景场景理解中的局限性，并提出了一种基于强化学习的方法360-R1以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在全景图像理解能力上存在不足，缺乏专门的数据集和基准测试，因此需要填补这一空白并探索改进方法。

Method: 提出了OmniVQA数据集和基准测试，并基于Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct设计了360-R1方法，通过三种新的奖励函数改进GRPO。

Result: 实验表明360-R1在全景空间中的性能提升了6%，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 全景视觉理解需要专门的模型改进，OmniVQA和360-R1为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs), with their 360{\deg} field of view, provide
unparalleled spatial awareness for immersive applications like augmented
reality and embodied AI. However, the capability of existing multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes
remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA,
the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual
question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals
significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering,
highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction,
and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results
underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of
omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural
or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA
dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning
method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group
relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions:
(1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward,
and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our
OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional
space (+6% improvement).

*Yang Hu,Runchen Wang,Stephen Chong Zhao,Xuhui Zhan,Do Hun Kim,Mark Wallace,David A. Tovar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perceptual-Initialization (PI) 通过在人感知结构初始化阶段整合人类感知数据，显著提升了零样本性能，无需任务特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统方法，探索在人感知数据初始化阶段而非微调阶段整合人类感知结构，以提升视觉表示学习的泛化能力。

Method: 利用NIGHTS数据集的人类感知三元组嵌入初始化CLIP视觉编码器，随后在YFCC15M上进行自监督学习。

Result: 在29个零样本分类和2个检索基准测试中表现显著提升，ImageNet-1K零样本性能在15个预训练周期后显现。

Conclusion: 早期整合人类感知结构能构建更强大的视觉-语言对齐系统，为通用视觉语言智能提供更坚实基础。

Abstract: We introduce Perceptual-Initialization (PI), a paradigm shift in visual
representation learning that incorporates human perceptual structure during the
initialization phase rather than as a downstream fine-tuning step. By
integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to
initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on
YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance
improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot
classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains
emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed
across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different
stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our
approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and
retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks,
without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge
the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for
fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during
early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned
systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that
"beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger
foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

*Jie Li,Shengwei Tian,Long Yu,Xin Ning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种灵活加权的Chamfer距离（FCD），通过调整权重改善点云生成的全局分布，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Chamfer距离（CD）作为目标函数时，固定权重可能导致全局分布不佳，尽管CD分数低。

Method: 提出FCD，为CD的全局分布部分分配更高权重，并采用灵活加权策略调整两部分平衡。

Result: 在两个先进网络上实验，FCD在CD、EMD、DCD、F-Score及人工评估中表现更优。

Conclusion: FCD能有效改善点云生成的全局分布，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) comprises two components that can evaluate the global
distribution and local performance of generated point clouds, making it widely
utilized as a similarity measure between generated and target point clouds in
point cloud completion tasks. Additionally, CD's computational efficiency has
led to its frequent application as an objective function for guiding point
cloud generation. However, using CD directly as an objective function with
fixed equal weights for its two components can often result in seemingly high
overall performance (i.e., low CD score), while failing to achieve a good
global distribution. This is typically reflected in high Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) and Decomposed Chamfer Distance (DCD) scores, alongside poor human
assessments. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible-Weighted Chamfer
Distance (FCD) to guide point cloud generation. FCD assigns a higher weight to
the global distribution component of CD and incorporates a flexible weighting
strategy to adjust the balance between the two components, aiming to improve
global distribution while maintaining robust overall performance. Experimental
results on two state-of-the-art networks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior results across multiple evaluation metrics, including CD, EMD, DCD,
and F-Score, as well as in human evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在纯视觉问题回答任务中的性能不足，增强视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出GRT-SFT结构化微调策略，引导模型基于视觉输入逐步推理。

Result: 显著提升模型在VoQA任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 工作提升了模型在复杂多模态场景中的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: We propose Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), a novel multimodal task in
which questions are visually embedded within images, without any accompanying
textual input. This requires models to locate, recognize, and reason over
visually embedded textual questions, posing challenges for existing large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which show notable performance drops even with
carefully designed prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guided Response
Triggering Supervised Fine-tuning (GRT-SFT), a structured fine-tuning strategy
that guides the model to perform step-by-step reasoning purely based on visual
input, significantly improving model performance. Our work enhances models'
capacity for human-like visual understanding in complex multimodal scenarios,
where information, including language, is perceived visually.

TL;DR: UniVG-R1是一个基于推理的多模态大语言模型，通过强化学习和冷启动数据提升视觉定位能力，在复杂多模态场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉定位方法难以处理复杂指令和多图像场景，缺乏跨模态推理能力。

Method: 构建高质量推理链数据集，结合监督微调和基于规则的强化学习，并提出难度感知权重调整策略。

Result: 在MIG-Bench上性能提升9.1%，零样本性能平均提升23.4%。

Conclusion: UniVG-R1在复杂视觉定位任务中表现卓越，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image
scenarios with simple textual references. However, extending these methods to
real-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions,
particularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges,
which is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse
multi-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical
universal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal
large language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
cold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning
chains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised
fine-tuning. Subsequently, we perform rule-based reinforcement learning to
encourage the model to identify correct reasoning chains, thereby incentivizing
its reasoning capabilities. In addition, we identify a difficulty bias arising
from the prevalence of easy samples as RL training progresses, and we propose a
difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy to further strengthen the
performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVG-R1,
which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIG-Bench with a 9.1%
improvement over the previous method. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong
generalizability, achieving an average improvement of 23.4% in zero-shot
performance across four image and video reasoning grounding benchmarks. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本场景中因缺失标签问题导致偏置分类，本文首次正式提出并分析了这一问题。

Method: 将标准分类头解耦为两个独立的头，分别处理清晰的正样本和由缺失标签引起的噪声负样本。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和MS-COCO基准测试中，模型无需额外计算成本和参数，性能显著优于基线和最先进方法。

Conclusion: 解耦分类头的方法有效缓解了偏置分类问题，为少样本学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper focus on few-shot object detection~(FSOD) and instance
segmentation~(FSIS), which requires a model to quickly adapt to novel classes
with a few labeled instances. The existing methods severely suffer from bias
classification because of the missing label issue which naturally exists in an
instance-level few-shot scenario and is first formally proposed by us. Our
analysis suggests that the standard classification head of most FSOD or FSIS
models needs to be decoupled to mitigate the bias classification. Therefore, we
propose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the
standard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are
capable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative
samples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can
effectively learn novel classes while mitigating the effects of noisy negative
samples. Without bells and whistles, our model without any additional
computation cost and parameters consistently outperforms its baseline and
state-of-the-art by a large margin on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks for
FSOD and FSIS tasks. The Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源研究中，多模态代理能力（尤其是图像处理）的发展相对滞后，缺乏相关基准测试。

Method: 提出Visual-ARFT方法，通过强化微调赋予模型图像处理和实时搜索能力，并设计了MAT基准测试（MAT-Search和MAT-Coding）。

Result: Visual-ARFT在MAT-Coding和MAT-Search上分别提升18.6% F1/13.0% EM和10.3% F1/8.7% EM，超越GPT-4o，并在多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Visual-ARFT为构建鲁棒且通用的多模态代理提供了有效路径。

Abstract: A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native
agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and
writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the
open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in
language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration,
the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking
with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This
work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the
ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to
manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image
processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT)
with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'
agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and
+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT
also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks
such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building
robust and generalizable multimodal agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本提示的编辑方法依赖人工设计提示，耗时且可能引入无关细节，限制了编辑性能。

Method: 利用属性分类器学习数据集级别的精确语义嵌入，优化嵌入以指导图像编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能实现高度解耦和跨领域数据的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖文本提示或模型训练，实现了高效、准确的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality image generation and editing. Many existing approaches rely on
text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the
need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce
irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work,
we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to
steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text
prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We
utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level.
The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal
representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate
edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of
disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过优化注意力分布与信息流的对齐，提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的视觉理解能力，减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于解码器模型的单向掩码机制，视觉信息在传播过程中存在注意力分布与信息流不匹配的问题，导致模型视觉理解能力下降和幻觉现象。

Method: 通过识别关注核心语义表示的注意力头，并采用两阶段优化范式，将注意力分布与信息流对齐。

Result: 在五个不同的LVLM上评估，显著减少了幻觉现象，同时揭示了减少幻觉与丰富细节之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型的视觉理解能力，并允许手动调整模型的保守性，满足多样化需求。

Abstract: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate
information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the
same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic
representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we
observe that over 80\% of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic
representations. However, the model's attention still predominantly focuses on
the visual representations. This misalignment between the attention
distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual
understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue,
we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information
embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads
that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention
distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate
the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the
attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method
on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating
its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments
reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably,
our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness,
enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements. Code will be
released once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推测解码方法在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中无法达到与单模态大语言模型（LLMs）相同的加速效果，因此需要针对MLLMs重新设计推测解码方法。

Method: MSD通过分离处理文本和视觉标记，并采用两阶段训练策略（先文本指令调优，再逐步引入多模态数据）来优化草案模型。

Result: 实验表明，MSD在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-1.5-13B上分别实现了最高2.29倍和2.46倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: MSD有效提升了MLLMs的推理速度，同时保持了准确性，为多模态模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces Multimodal Speculative Decoding (MSD) to accelerate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inference. Speculative decoding has
been shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to
achieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine
speculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM
characteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual
tokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed
separately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual
perception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle,
MSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be
handled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a
two-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on
text-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability.
In stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual
perception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts
inference speed by up to $2.29\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\times$
for LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉数据收集成本高且耗时，而视觉上不同的物体可能具有相似的触觉特性，因此可以利用视觉数据中的材料线索来指导触觉理解。

Method: 通过重新标注大规模视觉数据集以包含触觉描述，并利用检索增强框架将视觉-文本表示与触觉输入对齐。

Result: 在TVL基准测试中优于现有方法，展示了基于检索的视觉重用对触觉理解的潜力。

Conclusion: RA-Touch证明了通过视觉数据增强触觉感知的可行性，为触觉理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visuo-tactile perception aims to understand an object's tactile properties,
such as texture, softness, and rigidity. However, the field remains
underexplored because collecting tactile data is costly and labor-intensive. We
observe that visually distinct objects can exhibit similar surface textures or
material properties. For example, a leather sofa and a leather jacket have
different appearances but share similar tactile properties. This implies that
tactile understanding can be guided by material cues in visual data, even
without direct tactile supervision. In this paper, we introduce RA-Touch, a
retrieval-augmented framework that improves visuo-tactile perception by
leveraging visual data enriched with tactile semantics. We carefully recaption
a large-scale visual dataset with tactile-focused descriptions, enabling the
model to access tactile semantics typically absent from conventional visual
datasets. A key challenge remains in effectively utilizing these tactile-aware
external descriptions. RA-Touch addresses this by retrieving visual-textual
representations aligned with tactile inputs and integrating them to focus on
relevant textural and material properties. By outperforming prior methods on
the TVL benchmark, our method demonstrates the potential of retrieval-based
visual reuse for tactile understanding. Code is available at

Method: 使用了pix2pix、CycleGAN、CUT等模型，并结合深度信息进行实验，评估了FID和SSIM指标。

Result: pix2pix在FID上表现最佳，CUT结合深度信息实现了最低FID；autoencoder在SSIM上表现最优。

Conclusion: 深度信息能提升图像真实感，但可能影响结构保真度；不同模型在感知质量和结构保留上各有优劣。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning and generative
adversarial networks for generating realistic underwater images from synthetic
images with uniform lighting. We investigate the performance of image
translation models for generating realistic underwater images using the VAROS
dataset. Two key evaluation metrics, Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), provide insights into the
trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural preservation. For paired
image translation, pix2pix achieves the best FID scores due to its paired
supervision and PatchGAN discriminator, while the autoencoder model attains the
highest SSIM, suggesting better structural fidelity despite producing blurrier
outputs. Among unpaired methods, CycleGAN achieves a competitive FID score by
leveraging cycle-consistency loss, whereas CUT, which replaces
cycle-consistency with contrastive learning, attains higher SSIM, indicating
improved spatial similarity retention. Notably, incorporating depth information
into CUT results in the lowest overall FID score, demonstrating that depth cues
enhance realism. However, the slight decrease in SSIM suggests that depth-aware
learning may introduce structural variations.

Conclusion: RADAR通过系统整合内外知识，显著提升放射学报告生成效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches
have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their
performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval.
However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within
the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration and inefficient
utilization of learned representations. To address this limitation, we propose
RADAR, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary
knowledge injection. RADAR improves report generation by systematically
leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved
information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge
that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves
relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally,
by aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative
radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU
X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both
language quality and clinical accuracy

experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in
existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily
focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking
the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials'
inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the
tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware
priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned
characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better
capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more
accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and
textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics,
haptic feedback systems, and material editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了图像质量退化对人脸识别技术（FRT）准确性和公平性的影响，发现女性和黑人群体误差率更高，但FRT准确性仍高于传统法医方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FRT在低质量图像（如执法常见）中的表现，关注其对不同人口群体的公平性。

Method: 使用StyleGAN3生成合成人脸，模拟五种图像退化（对比度、亮度、运动模糊、姿态变化、分辨率），并通过Deepface和ArcFace进行1:n识别任务测试。

Result: 误报率在基线质量附近最高，误报率随退化加剧而上升（尤其是模糊和低分辨率）；女性和黑人群体误差率更高，黑人女性受影响最大。

Conclusion: FRT在严格验证和监管下可作为有价值的调查工具，但需关注使用透明度和公平性。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly used in criminal
investigations, yet most evaluations of its accuracy rely on high-quality
images, unlike those often encountered by law enforcement. This study examines
how five common forms of image degradation--contrast, brightness, motion blur,
pose shift, and resolution--affect FRT accuracy and fairness across demographic
groups. Using synthetic faces generated by StyleGAN3 and labeled with FairFace,
we simulate degraded images and evaluate performance using Deepface with
ArcFace loss in 1:n identification tasks. We perform an experiment and find
that false positive rates peak near baseline image quality, while false
negatives increase as degradation intensifies--especially with blur and low
resolution. Error rates are consistently higher for women and Black
individuals, with Black females most affected. These disparities raise concerns
about fairness and reliability when FRT is used in real-world investigative
contexts. Nevertheless, even under the most challenging conditions and for the
most affected subgroups, FRT accuracy remains substantially higher than that of
many traditional forensic methods. This suggests that, if appropriately
validated and regulated, FRT should be considered a valuable investigative
tool. However, algorithmic accuracy alone is not sufficient: we must also
evaluate how FRT is used in practice, including user-driven data manipulation.
Such cases underscore the need for transparency and oversight in FRT deployment
to ensure both fairness and forensic validity.

TL;DR: VBenchComp提出了一种自动化分类方法，将视频理解问题分为LLM-Answerable、Semantic、Temporal和Others四类，以更精确评估视频LLM的能力。

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准常混淆知识问题和纯图像问题，未能清晰评估模型的时间推理能力，这是视频理解的核心。

Result: 分析揭示了传统评分掩盖的模型弱点，为未来基准设计提供了建议。

Conclusion: VBenchComp能更准确地评估视频LLM，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and
purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal
reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video
understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that
obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the
dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer
questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where
models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames
are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an
automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains:
LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions
can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable
even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require
understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions
are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different
capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that
are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and
recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess
video LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed
DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label
Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored
adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional
discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the
discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein,
we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly
derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a
two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target
predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the
traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component.
Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate
an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is
therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids
the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The
proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering
three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that
DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision
while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly
available at github.com/cvi2snt/DDA-MLIC.

Abstract: Plane geometry problem solving (PGPS) has recently gained significant

large vision-language models. Despite the growing interest in PGPS, the
research community still lacks a comprehensive overview that systematically
synthesizes recent work in PGPS. To fill this gap, we present a survey of
existing PGPS studies. We first categorize PGPS methods into an encoder-decoder
framework and summarize the corresponding output formats used by their encoders
and decoders. Subsequently, we classify and analyze these encoders and decoders
according to their architectural designs. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising directions for future research. In particular, we discuss the
hallucination issues arising during the encoding phase within encoder-decoder
architectures, as well as the problem of data leakage in current PGPS
benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了反事实T2I中的概念对齐能力。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效解决了反事实T2I中的概念对齐问题，为AIGC提供了更灵活的生成能力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) has been prevalent in recent years, with most common
condition tasks having been optimized nicely. Besides, counterfactual
Text-to-Image is obstructing us from a more versatile AIGC experience. For
those scenes that are impossible to happen in real world and anti-physics, we
should spare no efforts in increasing the factual feel, which means
synthesizing images that people think very likely to be happening, and concept
alignment, which means all the required objects should be in the same frame. In
this paper, we focus on concept alignment. As controllable T2I models have
achieved satisfactory performance for real applications, we utilize this
technology to replace the objects in a synthesized image in latent space
step-by-step to change the image from a common scene to a counterfactual scene
to meet the prompt. We propose a strategy to instruct this replacing process,
which is called as Explicit Logical Narrative Prompt (ELNP), by using the newly
SoTA language model DeepSeek to generate the instructions. Furthermore, to
evaluate models' performance in counterfactual T2I, we design a metric to
calculate how many required concepts in the prompt can be covered averagely in
the synthesized images. The extensive experiments and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that our strategy can boost the concept alignment in counterfactual
T2I.

Method: 通过分层多模态对齐学习动作与环境特征的关联，利用对比学习训练模态编码器，将IMU信号中的短期动作线索与点云中的局部环境特征对齐。

Result: 实验证明EAIL在惯性定位和动作识别任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAIL框架不仅有效解决了惯性定位问题，还能作为副产品识别动作序列。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric
Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action
cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a
3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor
noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions
further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion
patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions observed through the
head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending
down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as
spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL
framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment. By
assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it
contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action
cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. These
encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time
and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can
further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a
by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action
recognition baselines.

Conclusion: Vid2World为将视频扩散模型转化为交互式世界模型提供了一种通用方法。

Abstract: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and
action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for
sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require
extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse
predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast,
video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that
capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a
general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion
models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs
casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its
architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation.
Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action
controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments
in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a
scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion
models to interactive world models.

Motivation: 现有检测器在偏置数据集上训练时容易过拟合非因果图像属性，导致在无偏数据集上性能下降。

Method: 提出DDA方法，同时对齐像素和频率域，并引入DDA-COCO和EvalGEN测试集。

Result: 在8个多样化基准测试中，DDA方法显著提升检测器性能，尤其在野外基准上提升7.2%。

Conclusion: DDA方法通过多域对齐显著提升检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the
possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously
correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance
performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance
degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to
perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the
semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this
approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The
reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can
perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction
models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly
due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level
misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency
content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating
high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues.
To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the
pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets:
DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector
performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest
generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures
such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations
demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could
improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on
in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased
detectors.

Abstract: Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge the information gap between
images and natural language. Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on
massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the
remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models
benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate
strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks.
Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational
manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a
timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage
paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing:
contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image
generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture
and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing
works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in
contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model
capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models
with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets
used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of
their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption
generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally,
we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research
directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague requirement
comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability, continually scalable model
capabilities, and large-scale datasets featuring richer modalities and greater
challenges.

Conclusion: DeepEyes展示了视觉与文本推理的自然整合能力，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by
text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of
visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a
significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual
input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in
this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and
introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities
incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for
cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself,
leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on
separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data
selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted
reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on
fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates
improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks.
Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from
initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse
thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes. Code is

Result: 评估了18个先进MLLMs，揭示了其VI-CoT能力的关键见解。

Conclusion: ViC-Bench为自由视觉状态下的推理能力评估提供了系统工具，并揭示了MLLMs的VI-CoT能力。

Abstract: Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually
update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual
states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in
various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks.
Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively
fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original
thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning
capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically
explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning
performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed
ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw
puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task
has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To
systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation
suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new
metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection
(IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We
extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights
into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at

Conclusion: PanoDPO能有效增强LMMs在时间分析中的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
performance on general video comprehension benchmarks. Nevertheless, for
broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability
needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by
this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which
introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and
textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16
mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and
textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal
dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct
preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both
visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results
show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and
reliability in temporal analysis.

Method: 提出二进制局部排序图统一相对和绝对深度表示，并通过像素级线性回归模块全局自适应对齐单目深度与视差。

Result: 在从SceneFlow到Middlebury和Booster数据集的泛化实验中，性能显著提升，效率几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用单目先验，有效且高效地支持立体匹配结果。

Abstract: The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to
handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing
monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased
monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the
generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the
unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the
generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and
observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The
first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular
depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular
feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity
update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map
could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed
at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we
propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the
depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute
depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight
the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In
addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the
disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression
module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the
monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently.
We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing
from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the
efficiency.

Abstract: Video large language models (VideoLLM) excel at video understanding, but face
efficiency challenges due to the quadratic complexity of abundant visual
tokens. Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs
reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across
frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation
constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient
operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for
VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration
framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's
uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames,
effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video
sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks
demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only
25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on
LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame
Compression Adjustment strategy is compatible with other token compression
methods to further improve their performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VisualQuality-R1是一种基于强化学习的无参考图像质量评估模型，通过推理和相对质量排名提升性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理诱导的计算模型在图像质量评估（IQA）中的潜力，解决传统方法依赖视觉推理不足的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习中的组相对策略优化生成质量分数，基于Thurstone模型计算比较概率，定义连续保真度奖励。

Result: VisualQuality-R1在实验中优于现有无参考IQA模型，支持多数据集训练并生成人类对齐的质量描述。

Conclusion: VisualQuality-R1适用于多种图像处理任务，如超分辨率和图像生成，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing
reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of
reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in
the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on
visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a
reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with
reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the
intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of
images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple
quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute
comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other
under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using
continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms
discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent
reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is
capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions,
and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale
realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for
reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like
super-resolution and image generation.

TL;DR: RAVENEA是一个新的基准测试，通过检索增强视觉文化理解，在文化视觉问答和图像描述任务中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文化细微差别理解上表现不足，多模态场景下的检索增强方法研究较少。

Method: 引入RAVENEA基准，整合10,000+维基百科文档，训练并评估七种多模态检索器，测试其对14种先进VLMs的影响。

Result: 检索增强的轻量级VLMs在文化视觉问答和图像描述任务中分别提升3.2%和6.2%。

Conclusion: 检索增强方法和文化包容性基准对多模态理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical.
Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances
effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in
text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented
Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual
culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused
visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC).
RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia
documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and
evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the
downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen
state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented
with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by
at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the
value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for
multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过确保同一类别样本的潜在空间活跃维度一致，增强潜在空间的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VAE的潜在空间分散且无结构，限制了其可解释性。VSC虽引入稀疏表示，但未解决同一类别样本间活跃维度一致性问题。

Method: 引入新的损失函数，鼓励同一类别样本共享相似的活跃维度，从而构建更结构化、可解释的潜在空间。

Result: 方法生成的结构化潜在空间中，共享维度对应高级概念，同时捕捉全局和类别特定因素。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了潜在空间的解释性和实用性，优于现有解耦方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning
latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured
latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability,
especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational
Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting
in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations,
characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more
interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured
interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from
the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for
variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent
patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not
enforce such consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space
interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are
consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce
a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share
similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and
interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a
high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods
that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method
captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility
and interpretability of latent representations.

TL;DR: ReservoirTTA是一种新的插件框架，用于长时间测试时适应（TTA），通过维护一个领域专用模型库来应对持续变化的测试领域，避免单模型适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试领域持续变化时单模型适应导致的灾难性遗忘、领域间干扰和错误累积等问题。

Method: 使用在线聚类检测新领域，并通过路由机制将样本分配到专用模型，实现领域特定适应。

Result: 在ImageNet-C、CIFAR-10/100-C和Cityscapes→ACDC等任务中表现优于现有方法，适应精度高且稳定。

Conclusion: ReservoirTTA在多领域持续变化场景下表现出色，解决了单模型适应的关键限制。

Abstract: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for
prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain
continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve
gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of
domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both
detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming
samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and
thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes
key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting,
inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable
performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical
analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model
collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of
previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification
corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the
Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and
continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA
significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance
across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: SparC框架通过结合稀疏可变形立方体表示和新型编码器，解决了3D对象合成中的细节丢失问题，实现了高保真重建和高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D对象合成中因表示效率低和模态不匹配导致细节丢失，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SparC框架，结合SparseCubes稀疏表示和SparConv-VAE编码器，支持高分辨率3D重建和生成。

Result: SparC在复杂输入上实现最高保真重建，保留细节，降低计算成本，并与潜在扩散模型兼容。

Conclusion: SparC为高分辨率3D生成提供了一种高效且保真的解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than
2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic
complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing
meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent
diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient
representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce SparC,
a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes
representation SparseCubes with a novel encoder SparConv-VAE. SparseCubes
converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary
topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse
cube, allowing differentiable optimization. SparConv-VAE is the first
modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse
convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction
suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion.
SparC achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs,
including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It
preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and
integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution
3D generation.

Motivation: 现有参考无关的去合成方法受限于训练和测试数据的分布假设，如合成技术和人脸风格。

Method: 采用扩散模型，从合成图像中分离出原始人脸，支持跨技术和风格的泛化。

Result: 在六个数据集和两个人脸匹配器上验证，性能优于现有方法≥59.46%。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨技术和风格的去合成任务中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two (or more) face images corresponding
to two (or more) identities to produce a composite that successfully matches
the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this
process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference
images. Previous RF demorphing methods were overly constrained, as they rely on
assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the
morphing technique used, face style, and images used to create the morph. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively
disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual
fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and
face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a
common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on
morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real
morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six
datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our
method.

Conclusion: CP-GS为单视角参考图像的3D场景个性化提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive
user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency
across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However,
these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by
the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to
effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing
methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this
viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this
paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS),
a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance
to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D
generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference
appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the
personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided
by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our
CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality
personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will
be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.

Motivation: 当前脑图像解码方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，且通常忽略时间维度，限制了时间分辨率的解码能力。

Method: 提出Dynadiff，一种单阶段扩散模型，直接从动态fMRI信号中重建图像。

Result: Dynadiff在时间分辨率和语义重建方面优于现有方法，同时在预处理数据上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Dynadiff为时间分辨的脑图像解码奠定了基础。

Abstract: Brain-to-image decoding has been recently propelled by the progress in
generative AI models and the availability of large ultra-high field functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, current approaches depend on
complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically
collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting
time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural
Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion
model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI
recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff
simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially
on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining
competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach
allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in
brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved
brain-to-image decoding.

Motivation: SGPN在实例分割中使用内存密集的相似性矩阵，导致内存占用随点数平方增长，亟需改进。

Method: 通过子采样点集计算实例分割，再通过最近邻方法将标签扩展到完整点集，比较了两种采样策略。

Result: 两种方法在大子采样集上表现相当，但随机采样策略在速度和内存使用上提升显著。

Conclusion: 随机采样策略是解决内存问题的有效方法，适用于大规模点集实例分割。

Abstract: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and
PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point
sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks
enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for
Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN)
[WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors,
pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory
quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this
issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance
Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the
complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches
perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the
most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches.
We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches
through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a
realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map
using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called
MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch
pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches
have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our
pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not
generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a
3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of
drawings.

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过端元束和灵活稀疏惩罚项，显著提升了高光谱解混的准确性。

Abstract: Due to low spatial resolution, hyperspectral data often consists of mixtures
of contributions from multiple materials. This limitation motivates the task of
hyperspectral unmixing (HU), a fundamental problem in hyperspectral imaging. HU
aims to identify the spectral signatures (\textit{endmembers}) of the materials
present in an observed scene, along with their relative proportions
(\textit{fractional abundance}) in each pixel. A major challenge lies in the
class variability in materials, which hinders accurate representation by a
single spectral signature, as assumed in the conventional linear mixing model.
Moreover, To address this issue, we propose using group sparsity after
representing each material with a set of spectral signatures, known as
endmember bundles, where each group corresponds to a specific material. In
particular, we develop a bundle-based framework that can enforce either
inter-group sparsity or sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) on the
abundance coefficients. Furthermore, our framework offers the flexibility to
incorporate a variety of sparsity-promoting penalties, among which the
transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) penalty is a novel regularization in the HU
literature. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real
hyperspectral data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range
of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech
recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes
continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet
these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising
solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and
inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy
degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are
quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations
are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant
speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations,
applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we
develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization
(DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing
additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved
performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy
degradation relative to the full-precision model.

Motivation: 现有LVU基准测试因依赖MCQ和强先验问题，无法真实评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）的长视频理解能力。

Method: 提出VideoEval-Pro，包含开放式短答案问题，要求理解整个视频内容，并通过感知和推理任务评估模型。

Result: 实验发现：（1）开放式问题下LMMs性能显著下降；（2）MCQ高分不意味着开放式高分；（3）VideoEval-Pro更能受益于增加输入帧数。

Conclusion: VideoEval-Pro提供了更真实可靠的LVU评估标准，揭示了该领域的真实进展。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU
benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a
rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing
benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation
results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer;
Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong
priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video.
For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame
from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of
frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which
is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU
benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video
understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a
realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer,
which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both
segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning
tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the
following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on
open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do
not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other
MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input
frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and
reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of
progress in this domain.

Abstract: Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in
engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product
innovation. Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand
extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation
show promise, existing models are limited by incomplete representations of CAD
operations, inability to generalize to real-world images, and low output
accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model
(VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python)
directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we
created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code
pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in
3D solid similarity. Notably, our VLM demonstrates some signs of
generalizability, successfully generating CAD code from real-world images and
executing CAD operations unseen during fine-tuning. The performance and

*Zikai Liao,Yi Ouyang,Yi-Lun Lee,Chen-Ping Yu,Yi-Hsuan Tsai,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态模型MM-When2Speak，用于预测对话中何时以及如何回应，显著提升了响应时机准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的聊天机器人在实时对话中难以把握回应时机，尤其是简短反应，主要因其依赖文本输入而缺乏多模态上下文。

Method: 构建了一个多模态数据集，并提出MM-When2Speak模型，整合视觉、听觉和文本信息预测回应时机和类型。

Result: MM-When2Speak在响应时机准确性上比现有单模态和LLM基线模型提升高达4倍。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对实现自然、及时的对话AI至关重要。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong
capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they
often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering
brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises
largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in
real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of
response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on
subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we
introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational
videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.
This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic
interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal
LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual
context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is
appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x
improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These
results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,
natural, and engaging conversational AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的降维技术AKRMap，用于可视化跨模态嵌入，通过学习投影空间中的度量景观核回归，提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法（如PCA和t-SNE）主要关注单模态内的特征分布，而忽略了跨模态的度量（如CLIPScore）。AKRMap旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AKRMap通过构建一个由后投影核回归损失指导的监督投影网络，并采用可联合优化的自适应广义核，生成更准确的跨模态嵌入可视化。

Result: 定量实验表明，AKRMap在生成更准确和可信的可视化方面优于现有降维方法。

Conclusion: AKRMap在可视化跨模态嵌入（如文本到图像模型）方面表现出高效性和交互性，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However,
visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been
primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like
PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within
a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore)
across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique
designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by
learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space.
Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a
post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized
kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach
enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex
metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom
and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that
AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and
trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in
visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code
and demo are available at https://github.com/yilinye/AKRMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将理解和生成任务分离，导致复杂提示生成受限。UniCTokens旨在通过统一框架解决这一问题。

Method: 提出UniCTokens框架，训练统一概念标记，采用渐进式三阶段训练策略（理解预热、生成引导、深化理解）。

Result: 在UnifyBench上，UniCTokens在概念理解、生成及知识驱动生成任务中表现优异，尤其在后者达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 研究表明，增强理解可提升生成质量，生成过程也能反哺理解。代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and
generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate
concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in
isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex
prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating
"$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions
of its hat. We call this kind of generation personalized knowledge-driven
generation. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework
that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision
language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set
of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two
personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with
three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from
understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual
benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM
personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing
concept understanding, concept generation, and knowledge-driven generation.
Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive
performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept
generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized
knowledge-driven generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced
understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield
valuable insights into understanding. Our code and dataset will be released at:

*Yu Tong,Zihao Pan,Shuai Yang,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndexMark是一种无需训练的自动回归图像生成模型水印框架，利用代码本冗余性嵌入水印，不影响图像质量，并通过验证方案提升抗裁剪攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成水印方法主要针对扩散模型，自动回归图像生成模型的水印研究不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 基于代码本冗余性，提出match-then-replace方法，选择相似水印标记并替换，嵌入水印；通过Index Encoder和辅助验证方案提升验证精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明IndexMark在图像质量和验证准确性上达到最优，且对裁剪、噪声等多种扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IndexMark为自动回归图像生成模型提供了一种高效、鲁棒的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent
malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative
watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while
watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely
underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for
autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy
property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with
similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in
IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully
selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and
promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby
embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark
verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in
generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder.
Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness
against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification
accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including
cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG
compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过强化学习训练视觉语言模型（VLM）进行图像推理，无需显式思维链监督。研究发现，直接应用强化学习会导致模型走捷径，提出通过先生成详细图像描述再推理的方法（caption-reason-answer格式）来避免这一问题。模型Visionary-R1在多个视觉推理基准测试中表现优于GPT-4o等强模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在图像推理任务中因走捷径而泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 使用强化学习训练VLM，采用caption-reason-answer输出格式，首先生成图像描述，再进行推理。

Result: Visionary-R1在273K无思维链监督的视觉问答对上训练后，在多个基准测试中超越GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: 通过先描述图像再推理的方法，可以有效避免模型走捷径，提升视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging
problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can
enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple
question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models
(VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and
visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning
to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before
providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy
questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data
distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to
encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train
the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially
generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an
extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer
pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1,
outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and
Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce UniGen, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable
of image understanding and generation. We study the full training pipeline of
UniGen from a data-centric perspective, including multi-stage pre-training,
supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. More importantly,
we propose a new Chain-of-Thought Verification (CoT-V) strategy for test-time
scaling, which significantly boosts UniGen's image generation quality using a
simple Best-of-N test-time strategy. Specifically, CoT-V enables UniGen to act
as both image generator and verifier at test time, assessing the semantic
alignment between a text prompt and its generated image in a step-by-step CoT
manner. Trained entirely on open-source datasets across all stages, UniGen
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image understanding and
generation benchmarks, with a final score of 0.78 on GenEval and 85.19 on
DPG-Bench. Through extensive ablation studies, our work provides actionable
insights and addresses key challenges in the full life cycle of building
unified MLLMs, contributing meaningful directions to the future research.

findings, pretraining details, data creation protocal, and release our code and
checkpoints to the community. The project page is at https://bagel-ai.org/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAT是一种无需训练的注意力加速策略，通过分组和智能注意力机制，显著提升扩散变换器的生成速度，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的高计算成本限制了实际应用，例如生成大尺寸图像耗时过长。

Method: GRAT通过分组令牌和限制键值令牌的结构化区域，减少计算开销，同时保留关键注意力模式。

Result: GRAT在生成8192×8192图像时实现了35.8倍的加速，且性能与完整注意力相当。

Conclusion: GRAT为扩散变换器的加速提供了有效方案，有望推动可扩展视觉生成的研究。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Transformers have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities, but their high computational costs hinder practical deployment,
for example, generating an $8192\times 8192$ image can take over an hour on an
A100 GPU. In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first,
\textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy
for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The
key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps
(which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and
leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous
tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns
and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative
Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within
the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key
and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as
surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational
overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention
when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention
patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and
HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT
achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while
maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future
research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体协作的框架，用于生成安全关键场景的合成数据，解决了现有方法语义深度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实世界中危险场景数据的稀缺性，训练AI系统面临挑战，需要一种端到端框架生成合成数据。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，包括评估智能体（基于LLM的语义一致性检查）和编辑智能体（生成和优化场景）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成符合安全需求和视觉语义的合成场景，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决多媒体安全应用中的数据稀缺问题提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of data depicting dangerous situations presents a major obstacle
to training AI systems for safety-critical applications, such as construction
safety, where ethical and logistical barriers hinder real-world data
collection. This creates an urgent need for an end-to-end framework to generate
synthetic data that can bridge this gap. While existing methods can produce
synthetic scenes, they often lack the semantic depth required for scene
simulations, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-agent framework that employs an iterative, in-the-loop collaboration
between two agents: an Evaluator Agent, acting as an LLM-based judge to enforce
semantic consistency and safety-specific constraints, and an Editor Agent,
which generates and refines scenes based on this guidance. Powered by LLM's
capabilities to reasoning and common-sense knowledge, this collaborative design
produces synthetic images tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Our
experiments suggest this design can generate useful scenes based on realistic
specifications that address the shortcomings of prior approaches, balancing
safety requirements with visual semantics. This iterative process holds promise
for delivering robust, aesthetically sound simulations, offering a potential
solution to the data scarcity challenge in multimedia safety applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对复杂工程问题的评估框架，揭示了LLMs在抽象推理和正式建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在工程领域的评估过于简化，缺乏对真实复杂问题的系统性测试。

Method: 引入了一个包含100多个真实工程问题的数据库，评估了四种先进LLMs的性能。

Result: LLMs在基础时空推理上表现良好，但在抽象推理和正式建模上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂工程任务中仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformative not only for daily activities
but also for engineering tasks. However, current evaluations of LLMs in
engineering exhibit two critical shortcomings: (i) the reliance on simplified
use cases, often adapted from examination materials where correctness is easily
verifiable, and (ii) the use of ad hoc scenarios that insufficiently capture
critical engineering competencies. Consequently, the assessment of LLMs on
complex, real-world engineering problems remains largely unexplored. This paper
addresses this gap by introducing a curated database comprising over 100
questions derived from authentic, production-oriented engineering scenarios,
systematically designed to cover core competencies such as product design,
prognosis, and diagnosis. Using this dataset, we evaluate four state-of-the-art
LLMs, including both cloud-based and locally hosted instances, to
systematically investigate their performance on complex engineering tasks. Our
results show that LLMs demonstrate strengths in basic temporal and structural
reasoning but struggle significantly with abstract reasoning, formal modeling,
and context-sensitive engineering logic.

<details>

Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型局限于单一课程数据，无法全面捕捉学习者的知识状态。

Method: 利用零样本LLM提示构建跨课程概念图，结合GCN和对比学习优化知识转移。

Result: TransKT显著提升了知识状态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TransKT为跨课程知识追踪提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict learners' future performance based on
historical learning interactions. However, existing KT models predominantly
focus on data from a single course, limiting their ability to capture a
comprehensive understanding of learners' knowledge states. In this paper, we
propose TransKT, a contrastive cross-course knowledge tracing method that
leverages concept graph guided knowledge transfer to model the relationships
between learning behaviors across different courses, thereby enhancing
knowledge state estimation. Specifically, TransKT constructs a cross-course
concept graph by leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to
establish implicit links between related concepts across different courses.
This graph serves as the foundation for knowledge transfer, enabling the model
to integrate and enhance the semantic features of learners' interactions across
courses. Furthermore, TransKT includes an LLM-to-LM pipeline for incorporating
summarized semantic features, which significantly improves the performance of
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) used for knowledge transfer. Additionally,
TransKT employs a contrastive objective that aligns single-course and
cross-course knowledge states, thereby refining the model's ability to provide
a more robust and accurate representation of learners' overall knowledge
states.

TL;DR: ADALog是一种自适应、无监督的异常检测框架，适用于异构日志数据，无需依赖日志解析或标记数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件系统生成的日志数据具有动态格式、碎片化事件序列和变化的时序模式，使得异常检测既关键又具有挑战性。

Method: ADALog基于预训练的双向编码器（Transformer），通过掩码语言建模任务提取日志上下文关系，并使用自适应阈值进行异常检测。

Result: 在BGL、Thunderbird和Spirit基准数据集上，ADALog表现出强大的泛化能力和竞争力。

Conclusion: ADALog能够动态适应系统行为变化，无需依赖启发式阈值，为日志异常检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern software systems generate extensive heterogeneous log data with
dynamic formats, fragmented event sequences, and varying temporal patterns,
making anomaly detection both crucial and challenging. To address these
complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection
framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world
environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict
sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual
unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs
adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a
transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language
modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic
and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are
identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into
log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only
on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system
behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in
traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird,
and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared
to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation
studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on
model behavior and interpretability.

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI作为自由职业开发者的潜力，但也指出了结构化任务与实际自由职业复杂性之间的差距。

Abstract: This study explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for
real-world tasks, including freelance software development. This work presents
a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on freelance programming and data analysis
tasks derived from economic data. We construct the benchmark using synthetic
tasks created from a Kaggle Freelancer dataset of job postings, with all job
prices standardized to USD (median fixed-project price around $250, and an
average of $306). Each task is accompanied by structured input-output test
cases and an estimated price tag, enabling automated correctness checking and a
monetary performance valuation. This approach is inspired by OpenAI's recent
SWE-Lancer benchmark (1,400 real Upwork tasks worth $1M total). Still, our
framework simplifies evaluation using programmatically testable tasks and
predicted price values, making it highly scalable and repeatable. On this
benchmark, we evaluate four modern LLMs - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen
2.5, and Mistral. We report each model's accuracy (task success rate and
test-case pass rate) and the total "freelance earnings" it achieves (sum of
prices of solved tasks). Our results show that Claude 3.5 Haiku performs best,
earning approximately $1.52 million USD, followed closely by GPT-4o-mini at
$1.49 million, then Qwen 2.5 ($1.33M) and Mistral ($0.70M). We analyze the
distribution of errors per task and observe that the strongest models solve the
most tasks and rarely fail completely on any project. We discuss the
implications of these results for the feasibility of AI as a freelance
developer, the advantages and limitations of our automated benchmark approach,
and the gap between performance on structured tasks versus the true complexity
of real-world freelance jobs.

Motivation: 由于MIRP问题的高复杂性，现有方法难以高效解决大规模实例。精确方法（如MIP）因计算时间过长而不实用，而启发式方法因问题的高度约束性而较少应用。本文旨在鼓励使用MIRPLib并促进结果比较。

Method: 提出了一种启发式方法，结合了Beam Search算法的变体和迭代局部搜索程序。

Result: 在测试的72个实例中，该方法在可接受的CPU时间内改进了10个实例的最佳已知解。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决MIRP问题提供了一种高效且实用的替代方案，有助于推动相关研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the
integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no
well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP
instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The
adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as
planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results
within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently
applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even
the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et
al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib,
aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances.
However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published
since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons,
this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical
optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon,
single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam
Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72
instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution
for ten instances within an acceptable CPU time.

TL;DR: BARREL框架通过减少过度思考和提升边界意识，显著提高了大型推理模型的事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在数学和逻辑推理中表现出过度自信和错误答案的问题，缺乏承认无知的能力。

Method: 提出BARREL框架，针对两种病态推理模式（最后一刻猜测和二次思考螺旋）进行优化，实现简洁且边界感知的事实推理。

Result: BARREL训练将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B的可靠性从39.33%提升至61.48%，同时保持与R1生成数据微调模型相当的准确性。

Conclusion: BARREL为构建更可靠和事实性的System 2 LRMs提供了启发性的初步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs
rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often
produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns
about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological
reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the
overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought
spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that
promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show
that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models
finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our
pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FinMaster是一个全面的金融基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLM）在金融领域的表现，填补现有评估框架的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融任务对全球经济稳定至关重要，但面临劳动密集、低容错性等问题。现有LLM评估基准缺乏领域特定数据和完整框架。

Method: FinMaster包含三个模块：FinSim生成合成金融数据，FinSuite提供多样化金融任务，FinEval提供统一评估接口。

Result: 实验显示LLM在复杂金融推理任务中表现显著下降，准确率从90%降至40%。

Conclusion: FinMaster填补了金融领域LLM评估的空白，有望推动LLM在金融实践中的应用。

Abstract: Financial tasks are pivotal to global economic stability; however, their
execution faces challenges including labor intensive processes, low error
tolerance, data fragmentation, and tool limitations. Although large language
models (LLMs) have succeeded in various natural language processing tasks and
have shown potential in automating workflows through reasoning and contextual
understanding, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in finance lack
sufficient domain-specific data, have simplistic task design, and incomplete
evaluation frameworks. To address these gaps, this article presents FinMaster,
a comprehensive financial benchmark designed to systematically assess the
capabilities of LLM in financial literacy, accounting, auditing, and
consulting. Specifically, FinMaster comprises three main modules: i) FinSim,
which builds simulators that generate synthetic, privacy-compliant financial
data for companies to replicate market dynamics; ii) FinSuite, which provides
tasks in core financial domains, spanning 183 tasks of various types and
difficulty levels; and iii) FinEval, which develops a unified interface for
evaluation. Extensive experiments over state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical
capability gaps in financial reasoning, with accuracy dropping from over 90% on
basic tasks to merely 40% on complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning.
This degradation exhibits the propagation of computational errors, where
single-metric calculations initially demonstrating 58% accuracy decreased to
37% in multimetric scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, FinMaster is the
first benchmark that covers full-pipeline financial workflows with challenging
tasks. We hope that FinMaster can bridge the gap between research and industry
practitioners, driving the adoption of LLMs in real-world financial practices
to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义稳定性的自动提示生成系统，通过评估提示的响应一致性（稳定性）来提升任务执行的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅基于任务表现评估提示，忽略了提示的稳定性和可靠性，这限制了系统的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出语义稳定性作为评估标准，并微调基于LLaMA的评估器来自动测量稳定性，开发了首个稳定性感知的通用提示生成系统。

Result: 实验证明，稳定性感知框架在通用和领域特定任务中均提高了准确性和输出一致性。

Conclusion: 通过关注提示的稳定性而非单次结果，论文为构建更可靠的通用系统提供了新视角和实用工具。

Abstract: Automatic prompt generation plays a crucial role in enabling general-purpose
multi-agent systems to perform diverse tasks autonomously. Existing methods
typically evaluate prompts based on their immediate task performance,
overlooking the intrinsic qualities that determine their reliability. This
outcome-centric view not only limits interpretability but also fails to account
for the inherent stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In this work,
we bring attention to prompt stability-the consistency of model responses
across repeated executions-as a key factor for building robust and effective
prompt generation systems. To quantify this, we propose semantic stability as a
criterion for assessing the response consistency of prompts, and fine-tune a
LLaMA-based evaluator to measure it automatically across tasks. These
components have enabled us to develop the first stability-aware general-purpose
prompt generation system that leverages stability feedback to iteratively
enhance both prompt quality and system-level performance. Furthermore, we
establish a logical chain between prompt stability and task success by
analyzing the structural dependencies within our system, proving stability as a
necessary condition for effective system-level execution. Empirical results
across general and domain-specific tasks demonstrate that our stability-aware
framework improves both accuracy and output consistency. By shifting the focus
from one-off results to persistent reliability, our work offers a new
perspective on prompt design and contributes practical tools for building more
trustworthy general-purpose systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索认知系统中反推断行为的成因及其对适应性的影响，为设计更灵活的认知架构提供理论基础。

Method: 通过分析强化学习、元认知和模型脆弱性等场景，结合人工系统、生物认知和人类心理学的证据进行研究。

Result: 反推断行为是一种普遍认知漏洞，即使在适应性良好的系统中也可能出现，需保持最小适应激活以应对稳定条件。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在信息压力下保持认知灵活性的重要性，并提出了抗僵化的设计原则。

Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural
and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents
misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic
rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which
such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance,
meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective
reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or
flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between
internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation
mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition,
human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior
as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise
well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving
minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design
principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under
informational stress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Dennett的假设，即语言对思维有根本性影响，并通过AI模型的表现来探讨这一观点。

Method: 分析大语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中的表现，比较有语言训练和无语言训练的AI系统。

Result: LLMs在广泛领域的推理能力支持了语言对思维的重要作用，尤其是语言的抽象性和高效编码。

Conclusion: 语言使推理在计算上可行，这一发现对理解人类生物思维中语言的作用提供了启示。

Abstract: Daniel Dennett speculated in *Kinds of Minds* 1996: "Perhaps the kind of mind
you get when you add language to it is so different from the kind of mind you
can have without language that calling them both minds is a mistake." Recent
work in AI can be seen as testing Dennett's thesis by exploring the performance
of AI systems with and without linguistic training. I argue that the success of
Large Language Models at inferential reasoning, limited though it may be,
supports Dennett's radical view about the effect of language on thought. I
suggest it is the abstractness and efficiency of linguistic encoding that lies
behind the capacity of LLMs to perform inferences across a wide range of
domains. In a slogan, language makes inference computationally tractable. I
assess what these results in AI indicate about the role of language in the
workings of our own biological minds.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体框架用于FAQ标注，结合多种方法和法官智能体优化结果，显著提升了准确性和排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FAQ标注方法依赖单一模型，难以捕捉多样用户查询的细微差别，需要更高效和准确的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，每个智能体使用不同的方法和结构化推理（ARQs），并通过法官智能体重排名候选结果。

Result: 在真实银行数据集和公共基准测试中，Top-1和Top-5准确率分别提升14%和18%，平均倒数排名提升12%。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模糊查询，适用于生产环境，并展现出跨领域和语言的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information
in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems.
Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not
capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized
agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to
produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach
inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through
systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our
framework features a specialized few-shot example strategy, where each agent
receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the
query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world banking dataset as well
as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant
improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a
14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12%
improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public
benchmarks when compared with traditional single agent annotation techniques.
Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making
it well-suited for deployment in production applications while showing strong
generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在固定计算预算下表现良好，但未充分利用推理预算。

Method: 将语言模型解码视为部分解状态空间的结构化搜索，应用A*搜索算法，并利用外部监督信号指导。

Result: A*-decoding在MATH500和AIME 2024基准测试中表现优异，性能接近更大模型，同时减少计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: 结构化搜索为语言模型推理提供了高效替代方案，未来可推动更高效部署。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful alternative to parameter
scaling for improving language model performance on complex reasoning tasks.
While existing methods have shown strong performance gains under fixed compute
budgets, there has been little focus on optimally utilizing that budget during
inference. In this work, we introduce A*-decoding, a search-based
inference-time strategy that builds on the A* search algorithm to optimally
utilize a fixed compute budget by prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths
during generation. We frame language model decoding as a structured search in a
state space of partial solutions, applying the A* transition model to identify
promising continuations guided by an external process supervision signal. In
our experiments, A*-decoding reaches the performance levels of strong inference
scaling baselines like best-of-N and particle filtering while using up to 3x
fewer tokens and 30% fewer PRM passes under equivalent compute budgets. On the
MATH500 and AIME 2024 benchmarks, A*-decoding enables Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to
match the performance of the 70x larger Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and allows
Qwen3-1.7B to reach o1-like reasoning accuracy. These results highlight the
power of structured search in decoding, offering an alternative to brute-force
sampling or scale-driven gains. Our work demonstrates how thoughtful
inference-time strategies can enhance reasoning in SLMs, pointing toward future
advances in more efficient and scalable language model deployment.

Motivation: 研究动物如何通过稀疏的片段记忆快速构建灵活的环境模型，并探索神经网络是否能实现类似能力。

Method: 在模拟环境中提出ESWM框架，通过稀疏和分散的片段记忆学习构建空间模型。

Result: ESWM具有高效样本利用率和适应性，无需额外训练即可实现探索和导航任务。

Conclusion: ESWM为从稀疏记忆中构建世界模型提供了有效解决方案，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Many animals possess a remarkable capacity to rapidly construct flexible
mental models of their environments. These world models are crucial for
ethologically relevant behaviors such as navigation, exploration, and planning.
The ability to form episodic memories and make inferences based on these sparse
experiences is believed to underpin the efficiency and adaptability of these
models in the brain. Here, we ask: Can a neural network learn to construct a
spatial model of its surroundings from sparse and disjoint episodic memories?
We formulate the problem in a simulated world and propose a novel framework,
the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), as a potential answer. We show that
ESWM is highly sample-efficient, requiring minimal observations to construct a
robust representation of the environment. It is also inherently adaptive,
allowing for rapid updates when the environment changes. In addition, we
demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring
novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the
need for additional training.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过预热阶段和RLVR训练，在数据稀缺环境下高效开发推理能力强的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量高质量数据，但在数据稀缺时难以实现。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 使用玩具领域（K&K逻辑谜题）预热模型；2) 在少量目标领域数据上应用RLVR。

Result: 预热阶段提升泛化推理能力；预热后模型在小数据集上表现更优；保持跨领域泛化性；提高样本效率。

Conclusion: 预热策略在数据稀缺环境下构建稳健推理LLMs具有潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with
carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on
extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of
quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage
training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the
first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain,
namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning
skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a
limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this
two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone
facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a
range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro. $(ii)$ When both
the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small
dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the
base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain
cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$
Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall
sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the
promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce
environments.

TL;DR: CHG是一种可扩展的方法，用于解释Transformer模型中注意力头的功能角色，通过软门控和因果分类（促进、干扰或无关）评估其对任务性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为假设驱动，需要提示模板或目标标签，而CHG可直接应用于任何数据集，提供因果性而非相关性分析。

Method: CHG学习注意力头的软门控，并通过标准的下一个词预测任务评估其因果作用。还引入了对比CHG，用于分离特定任务组件的子电路。

Result: 在Llama 3模型家族和多样化任务中，CHG揭示了稀疏且足够的子电路，头角色依赖交互（低模块化），指令遵循和上下文学习依赖不同机制。

Conclusion: CHG提供了一种无需假设的直接因果分析方法，揭示了Transformer模型中注意力头的功能多样性和交互依赖性。

Abstract: We present causal head gating (CHG), a scalable method for interpreting the
functional roles of attention heads in transformer models. CHG learns soft
gates over heads and assigns them a causal taxonomy - facilitating,
interfering, or irrelevant - based on their impact on task performance. Unlike
prior approaches in mechanistic interpretability, which are hypothesis-driven
and require prompt templates or target labels, CHG applies directly to any
dataset using standard next-token prediction. We evaluate CHG across multiple
large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks,
including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG
scores yield causal - not merely correlational - insight, validated via
ablation and causal mediation analyses. We also introduce contrastive CHG, a
variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components. Our findings
reveal that LLMs contain multiple sparse, sufficient sub-circuits, that
individual head roles depend on interactions with others (low modularity), and
that instruction following and in-context learning rely on separable
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）的元认知能力，即模型是否能监控和报告其内部激活模式，并设计了一种神经反馈范式来量化这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对LLMs的依赖增加，理解其元认知能力的限制对AI安全至关重要，尤其是模型可能隐藏内部过程以逃避监管。

Method: 采用神经科学启发的神经反馈范式，通过句子-标签对训练模型报告和控制其内部激活模式。

Result: LLMs能够学习报告和控制激活模式，但能力受示例数量、目标神经方向的语义可解释性及其解释方差的影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现LLMs的元认知空间维度远低于其神经空间，表明模型仅能监控部分神经机制，这对AI安全有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they
actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests
some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive
processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities
enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure
their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms
designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on
these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their
metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal
activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired
neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly
report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with
sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal
activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we
demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The
performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided,
the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance
explained by that direction. These results reveal a "metacognitive space" with
dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can
monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide
empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with
significant implications for AI safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果推理在医学、经济学等领域至关重要，但现有LLMs是否能可靠处理因果推理尚不明确，需要更严格的评估。

Method: 设计了CausalPitfalls基准，包含多难度挑战和评分标准，采用直接提示和代码辅助提示两种协议评估模型。

Result: 当前LLMs在统计因果推理中存在显著局限性，基准提供了量化指标和指导。

Conclusion: CausalPitfalls基准为开发可信因果推理系统提供了重要工具和方向。

Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes
areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear
whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy
statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified
tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal
relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models
may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or
selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real
world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming
common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges
across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This
approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities
and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols:
(1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2)
code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit
statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge
by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results
reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical
causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and
quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning
systems.

Conclusion: 推荐结合文档、训练和互动的熟悉方法。

Abstract: We compare three methods of familiarizing a human with an artificial
intelligence (AI) teammate ("agent") prior to operation in a collaborative,
fast-paced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) environment. In
a between-subjects user study (n=60), participants either read documentation
about the agent, trained alongside the agent prior to the mission, or were
given no familiarization. Results showed that the most valuable information
about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its
relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information
allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more
quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the
fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards
risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized
through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information
through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with
different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent's
internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual
participants' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be
considered when designing human-AI control interfaces. Based on our findings,
we recommend a human-AI team familiarization method that combines AI
documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.

Motivation: 确保大型推理模型（LRMs）中间推理过程的忠实性对于可靠监控、解释和有效控制至关重要。

Method: 提出反事实干预框架，从两个维度评估忠实性：1）草稿内忠实性（步骤间因果影响）；2）草稿到答案忠实性（结论逻辑一致性）。

Result: 实验表明，当前LRMs在中间步骤和结论的忠实性上表现不一致，存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在高级LRMs中实现更忠实和可解释推理的必要性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities
in complex problem-solving by introducing a thinking draft that enables
multi-path Chain-of-Thought explorations before producing final answers.
Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial
for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper,
we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously
evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary
dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual
reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft
conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer
Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent
with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding
logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our
findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to
intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the
draft conclusions. These results underscore the need for more faithful and
interpretable reasoning in advanced LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业LLM API通常隐藏推理过程，仅返回最终答案，导致用户无法验证令牌使用真实性，可能引发计费欺诈。

Method: CoIn通过构建可验证的哈希树检查令牌数量，并基于嵌入的相关性匹配检测伪造的推理内容。

Result: 实验表明，CoIn作为第三方审计工具，检测令牌计数膨胀的成功率高达94.7%。

Conclusion: CoIn能有效恢复LLM服务的计费透明度，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: As post-training techniques evolve, large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly augmented with structured multi-step reasoning abilities, often
optimized through reinforcement learning. These reasoning-enhanced models
outperform standard LLMs on complex tasks and now underpin many commercial LLM
APIs. However, to protect proprietary behavior and reduce verbosity, providers
typically conceal the reasoning traces while returning only the final answer.
This opacity introduces a critical transparency gap: users are billed for
invisible reasoning tokens, which often account for the majority of the cost,
yet have no means to verify their authenticity. This opens the door to token
count inflation, where providers may overreport token usage or inject
synthetic, low-effort tokens to inflate charges. To address this issue, we
propose CoIn, a verification framework that audits both the quantity and
semantic validity of hidden tokens. CoIn constructs a verifiable hash tree from
token embedding fingerprints to check token counts, and uses embedding-based
relevance matching to detect fabricated reasoning content. Experiments

Abstract: Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model
performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas
fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles.
Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have
been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed
ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal
patterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often
accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor
and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with
large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop
interpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise
annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and
combine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets
for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon
dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in
capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated
and expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap
between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable
evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem
modeling studies.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex designs while
minimizing waste, but faces challenges related to defects and process
anomalies. This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various
Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from
literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training
datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific
literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly
identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder
Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF
manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various
printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the
framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without
requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and
GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini
outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing
anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system
confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by
12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information.
The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging
research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM
technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework
streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TelePlanNet为电信运营商提供了高效、可扩展的基站选址工具，显著推进了蜂窝网络规划。

Abstract: The selection of base station sites is a critical challenge in 5G network
planning, which requires efficient optimization of coverage, cost, user
satisfaction, and practical constraints. Traditional manual methods, reliant on
human expertise, suffer from inefficiencies and are limited to an unsatisfied
planning-construction consistency. Existing AI tools, despite improving
efficiency in certain aspects, still struggle to meet the dynamic network
conditions and multi-objective needs of telecom operators' networks. To address
these challenges, we propose TelePlanNet, an AI-driven framework tailored for
the selection of base station sites, integrating a three-layer architecture for
efficient planning and large-scale automation. By leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for real-time user input processing and intent alignment with
base station planning, combined with training the planning model using the
improved group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, the
proposed TelePlanNet can effectively address multi-objective optimization,
evaluates candidate sites, and delivers practical solutions. Experiments
results show that the proposed TelePlanNet can improve the consistency to 78%,
which is superior to the manual methods, providing telecom operators with an
efficient and scalable tool that significantly advances cellular network
planning.

Result: 提出智能视频代理需具备的三大核心能力，为未来研究指明方向。

Conclusion: 通过整合神经符号方法，推动视频代理从被动感知向主动推理和行动转变。

Abstract: Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene
classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video
analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a
growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret
video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key
obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models
have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames
or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of
events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making.
Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning
approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic
perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured
into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an
approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide
stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing
trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the
research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents
that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and
analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content
generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive
perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing
the boundaries of video understanding.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined

Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the

improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对单步并行修正的约束已有研究，但迭代并行修正的扩展模型缺乏统一的理论基础。

Method: 基于TeamQueue聚合器家族，提出了一种扩展串行迭代信念修正算子的通用方法。

Result: 该方法能够恢复文献中独立合理的性质，同时避免不合理的假设。

Conclusion: 通过TeamQueue聚合器，提供了一种统一且合理的并行迭代信念修正方法。

Abstract: Despite efforts to better understand the constraints that operate on
single-step parallel (aka "package", "multiple") revision, very little work has
been carried out on how to extend the model to the iterated case. A recent
paper by Delgrande & Jin outlines a range of relevant rationality postulates.
While many of these are plausible, they lack an underlying unifying
explanation. We draw on recent work on iterated parallel contraction to offer a
general method for extending serial iterated belief revision operators to
handle parallel change. This method, based on a family of order aggregators
known as TeamQueue aggregators, provides a principled way to recover the
independently plausible properties that can be found in the literature, without
yielding the more dubious ones.

Abstract: In the field of AI4Science, large-scale language models (LLMs) show great
potential to parse complex scientific semantics, integrate cross-disciplinary
knowledge, and assist critical task research. However, in the field of drug
discovery, despite the optimization through professional data pre-training,
context window expansion, and internet search, the existing LLMs are still
facing challenges such as massive multi-modal and heterogeneous data
processing, domain knowledge dynamic updating delay, and insufficient
confidence in predicting the results of complex computational tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose the DrugPilot, an LLM-based agent with
parameterized reasoning for drug discovery. DrugPilot addresses key limitations
of traditional end-to-end LLM prediction approaches through its parametric
inference architecture. This agent system supports major phases of the drug
discovery pipeline, facilitating automated planning and execution of
multi-stage research tasks. To address the critical challenge of multi-modal
drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted
data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative
component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations,
simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue
while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission.
Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug
discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley
function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced
tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset,
outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT). Specifically, it achieves
task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% on simple, multiple, and
multi-turn tasks, respectively.

Result: 在45个数据集（含30种偏移场景）上验证，Vittle显著提升了模型在分布偏移下的表现。

Conclusion: Vittle为提升多模态大语言模型的鲁棒性提供了一种高效且理论支持的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer
performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar queries under distribution
shifts. Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require
either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of
which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we
take an alternative approach to enhance the robustness of MLLMs under
distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by
the information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound
of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction
Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of
Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness
metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of three MLLMs on open-ended and
closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45
datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently
improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a
minimal sufficient representation.

Result: 实验证明SPLIT-RAG在效率和准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLIT-RAG通过创新的分区和协作机制，有效提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often
rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple
queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address
these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework
that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph
partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework
first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the
Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware
graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically
coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while
lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant
partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while
enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves
inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements
compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在面对系统动态变化时需要完全重新认证的高成本问题。

Method: 提出VeRecycle框架，通过局部状态空间变化时复用概率证书，避免完全重新认证。

Result: 实验证明VeRecycle在节省计算资源和保持概率保证方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VeRecycle为神经控制中的概率认证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in the real world encounter a range of
uncertainties. Probabilistic neural Lyapunov certification is a powerful
approach to proving safety of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. When
faced with changes beyond the modeled uncertainties, e.g., unidentified
obstacles, probabilistic certificates must be transferred to the new system
dynamics. However, even when the changes are localized in a known part of the
state space, state-of-the-art requires complete re-certification, which is
particularly costly for neural certificates. We introduce VeRecycle, the first
framework to formally reclaim guarantees for discrete-time stochastic dynamical
systems. VeRecycle efficiently reuses probabilistic certificates when the
system dynamics deviate only in a given subset of states. We present a general
theoretical justification and algorithmic implementation. Our experimental
evaluation shows scenarios where VeRecycle both saves significant computational
effort and achieves competitive probabilistic guarantees in compositional
neural control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法将TKG视为独立子图序列，忽略了子图间的内部结构交互和潜在平滑特征，影响了推理性能。

Method: 设计了多跨度进化策略捕捉局部邻居特征和历史邻居语义信息，并引入解耦组件动态分离节点的活跃和稳定特征。

Result: 在四个真实TKG数据集上的实验表明，DiMNet在推理性能上显著优于现有方法，MRR提升高达22.7%。

Conclusion: DiMNet通过捕捉子图间交互和区分语义变化与平滑特征，显著提升了TKG推理性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge
by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future
facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in
recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent
subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive
reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling
subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural
interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs.
2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic
changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process.
Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network
(DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution
strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical
neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between
subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic
change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates
nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of
historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on
four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial
performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7%
in MRR.

Abstract: Mental health risk is a critical global public health challenge,
necessitating innovative and reliable assessment methods. With the development
of large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for
explainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches
predominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted
by inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable
predictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.
We investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as
complementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental
health risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive
pipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental
health contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of
numerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two
real-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We
anticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,
interpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions.

Conclusion: KMaP模型显著提升了学生知识和行为建模的个性化与准确性。

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for education, student knowledge tracing
and behavior modeling face persistent challenges: limited personalization,
inadequate modeling of diverse learning activities (especially non-assessed
materials), and overlooking the interplay between knowledge acquisition and
behavioral patterns. Practical limitations, such as fixed-size sequence
segmentation, frequently lead to the loss of contextual information vital for
personalized learning. Moreover, reliance on student performance on assessed
materials limits the modeling scope, excluding non-assessed interactions like
lectures. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Knowledge Modeling and
Material Prediction (KMaP), a stateful multi-task approach designed for
personalized and simultaneous modeling of student knowledge and behavior. KMaP
employs clustering-based student profiling to create personalized student
representations, improving predictions of future learning resource preferences.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm significant behavioral
differences across student clusters and validate the efficacy of the KMaP
model.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了有限记忆策略中的内存分配问题，提升了防御策略的实用性。

Abstract: Adversarial Patrolling games form a subclass of Security games where a
Defender moves between locations, guarding vulnerable targets. The main
algorithmic problem is constructing a strategy for the Defender that minimizes
the worst damage an Attacker can cause. We focus on the class of finite-memory
(also known as regular) Defender's strategies that experimentally outperformed
other competing classes. A finite-memory strategy can be seen as a positional
strategy on a finite set of states. Each state consists of a pair of a location
and a certain integer value--called memory. Existing algorithms improve the
transitional probabilities between the states but require that the available
memory size itself is assigned at each location manually. Choosing the right
memory assignment is a well-known open and hard problem that hinders the
usability of finite-memory strategies. We solve this issue by developing a
general method that iteratively changes the memory assignment. Our algorithm
can be used in connection with \emph{any} black-box strategy optimization tool.
We evaluate our method on various experiments and show its robustness by
solving instances of various patrolling models.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level
autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To
enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including
Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they
are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical
structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually
predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse
tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT),
where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL)
to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design
five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the
reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable
logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according
to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
(AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek)
illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to
13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to
make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL
navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific
LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks. Our code is
open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RL-LLM-Reasoning-1A30 for
reproducibility.

*Fanglin Mo,Junzhe Chen,Haoxuan Zhu,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPlanner是一个插件式规划模块，通过扩展有限状态机（EFSMs）建模应用逻辑，将用户指令分解为可执行步骤，显著提升移动GUI代理的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理在任务规划中因缺乏对应用逻辑的深入理解而容易迷失，导致执行效率低下。

Method: 利用EFSMs建模应用逻辑，分解用户指令为功能序列，通过LLM生成自然语言执行计划。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，SPlanner与Qwen2.5-VL-72B结合实现63.8%的任务成功率，提升28.8个百分点。

Conclusion: SPlanner通过结构化任务规划显著提升GUI代理的执行效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents execute user commands by directly interacting with the
graphical user interface (GUI) of mobile devices, demonstrating significant
potential to enhance user convenience. However, these agents face considerable
challenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and
generate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to
difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep
understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can
cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning
issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate
execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The
proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to
model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then
decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in
EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further
refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final
plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate
interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong
performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the
AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired
with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point
improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MMoLRE的多任务学习方法，用于多模态情感分析和情绪识别，通过共享和任务特定专家避免参数冲突，并利用低秩结构减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中硬参数共享忽略了复杂任务相关性导致的参数冲突，需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: MMoLRE结合共享和任务特定专家，并采用低秩专家网络减少参数和计算成本。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准测试中，MMoLRE在多模态情感分析任务上达到最优性能，在情绪识别任务上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MMoLRE有效解决了多任务学习中的参数冲突问题，同时降低了计算开销，性能优越。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables the efficient transfer of extra knowledge
acquired from other tasks. The high correlation between multimodal sentiment
analysis (MSA) and multimodal emotion recognition (MER) supports their joint
training. However, existing methods primarily employ hard parameter sharing,
ignoring parameter conflicts caused by complex task correlations. In this
paper, we present a novel MTL method for MSA and MER, termed Multimodal Mixture
of Low-Rank Experts (MMoLRE). MMoLRE utilizes shared and task-specific experts
to distinctly model common and unique task characteristics, thereby avoiding
parameter conflicts. Additionally, inspired by low-rank structures in the
Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, we design low-rank expert networks to
reduce parameter and computational overhead as the number of experts increases.
Extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks demonstrate that
MMoLRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSA task and competitive
results on the MER task.

Motivation: 现有方法要么使用忽略下游效用的搜索指标优化检索，要么联合微调整个大语言模型，限制了检索的实用性和兼容性。

Result: s3仅需2.4k训练样本即可超越基线，在多个QA基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: s3框架有效提升了检索增强生成系统的性能和兼容性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models
(LLMs) to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have
enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving
information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines.
However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only
metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM
to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and
limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary
models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework
that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a
Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG.
s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over
70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across
six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.

TL;DR: SHARP是一种新方法，用于生成高质量、多样化的STEM问题，以提升大型推理模型的强化学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的问题过于简单或不可验证，限制了模型在复杂任务上的进步。

Method: SHARP采用自对齐原则和三阶段框架（对齐、实例化、推理），结合强化学习循环优化模型推理。

Result: 在GPQA等基准测试中，SHARP显著提升了复杂推理的准确性，接近专家水平。

Conclusion: SHARP策略、框架设计和实验验证有效提升了大型推理模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Training large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning in STEM
domains is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable
problem sets. Existing synthesis methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting,
often generate oversimplified or uncheckable data, limiting model advancement
on complex tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHARP, a unified
approach to Synthesizing High-quality Aligned Reasoning Problems for LRMs
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). SHARP encompasses a
strategic set of self-alignment principles -- targeting graduate and
Olympiad-level difficulty, rigorous logical consistency, and unambiguous,
verifiable answers -- and a structured three-phase framework (Alignment,
Instantiation, Inference) that ensures thematic diversity and fine-grained
control over problem generation. We implement SHARP by leveraging a
state-of-the-art LRM to infer and verify challenging STEM questions, then
employ a reinforcement learning loop to refine the model's reasoning through
verifiable reward signals. Experiments on benchmarks such as GPQA demonstrate
that SHARP-augmented training substantially outperforms existing methods,
markedly improving complex reasoning accuracy and pushing LRM performance
closer to expert-level proficiency. Our contributions include the SHARP
strategy, framework design, end-to-end implementation, and experimental
evaluation of its effectiveness in elevating LRM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学建模是科学和工程的核心，但现有LLM在建模任务中表现不足。研究旨在填补这一空白，提升LLM在复杂建模问题中的应用能力。

Method: 提出MM-Agent框架，将建模分解为问题分析、模型构建、计算求解和报告生成四个阶段，并基于MM-Bench基准测试。

Result: MM-Agent在基准测试中表现优于基线模型，提升11.88%，并在MCM/ICM竞赛中帮助团队获得前2%的成绩。

Conclusion: MM-Agent展示了LLM在数学建模中的潜力，可作为建模辅助工具，提升效率和效果。

Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a cornerstone of scientific discovery and
engineering practice, enabling the translation of real-world problems into
formal systems across domains such as physics, biology, and economics. Unlike
mathematical reasoning, which assumes a predefined formulation, modeling
requires open-ended problem analysis, abstraction, and principled
formalization. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning
capabilities, they fall short in rigorous model construction, limiting their
utility in real-world problem-solving. To this end, we formalize the task of
LLM-powered real-world mathematical modeling, where agents must analyze
problems, construct domain-appropriate formulations, and generate complete
end-to-end solutions. We introduce MM-Bench, a curated benchmark of 111
problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), spanning the
years 2000 to 2025 and across ten diverse domains such as physics, biology, and
economics. To tackle this task, we propose MM-Agent, an expert-inspired
framework that decomposes mathematical modeling into four stages: open-ended
problem analysis, structured model formulation, computational problem solving,
and report generation. Experiments on MM-Bench show that MM-Agent significantly
outperforms baseline agents, achieving an 11.88\% improvement over human expert
solutions while requiring only 15 minutes and \$0.88 per task using GPT-4o.
Furthermore, under official MCM/ICM protocols, MM-Agent assisted two
undergraduate teams in winning the Finalist Award (\textbf{top 2.0\% among
27,456 teams}) in MCM/ICM 2025, demonstrating its practical effectiveness as a
modeling copilot. Our code is available at

Method: 提出DSMentor框架，结合课程学习和长期记忆，按难度递增组织任务，指导代理逐步学习。

Result: 在DSEval和QRData基准测试中，DSMentor将通过率提升5.2%，因果推理能力提升8.8%。

Conclusion: DSMentor展示了课程学习和知识积累在推理优化中的重要性，为LLM性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown promising performance in
generating code for solving complex data science problems. Recent studies
primarily focus on enhancing in-context learning through improved search,
sampling, and planning techniques, while overlooking the importance of the
order in which problems are tackled during inference. In this work, we develop
a novel inference-time optimization framework, referred to as DSMentor, which
leverages curriculum learning -- a strategy that introduces simpler task first
and progressively moves to more complex ones as the learner improves -- to
enhance LLM agent performance in challenging data science tasks. Our
mentor-guided framework organizes data science tasks in order of increasing
difficulty and incorporates a growing long-term memory to retain prior
experiences, guiding the agent's learning progression and enabling more
effective utilization of accumulated knowledge. We evaluate DSMentor through
extensive experiments on DSEval and QRData benchmarks. Experiments show that
DSMentor using Claude-3.5-Sonnet improves the pass rate by up to 5.2% on DSEval
and QRData compared to baseline agents. Furthermore, DSMentor demonstrates
stronger causal reasoning ability, improving the pass rate by 8.8% on the
causality problems compared to GPT-4 using Program-of-Thoughts prompts. Our
work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for
accumulating and utilizing knowledge during inference, mirroring the human
learning process and opening new avenues for improving LLM performance through
curriculum-based inference optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共交通延误常见且影响用户体验，现有解决方案未能充分利用实时延误数据进行动态调整。

Method: 提出两种动态重新规划方法：用户主动请求的“拉”方法和服务器主动监控的“推”方法。

Result: 实验显示“推”方法显著优于“拉”方法，动态重新规划能大幅节省到达时间。

Conclusion: 动态重新规划框架能有效利用实时数据优化公共交通路径，提升用户体验。

Abstract: Delays in public transport are common, often impacting users through
prolonged travel times and missed transfers. Existing solutions for handling
delays remain limited; backup plans based on historical data miss opportunities
for earlier arrivals, while snapshot planning accounts for current delays but
not future ones. With the growing availability of live delay data, users can
adjust their journeys in real-time. However, the literature lacks a framework
that fully exploits this advantage for system-scale dynamic replanning. To
address this, we formalise the dynamic replanning problem in public transport
routing and propose two solutions: a "pull" approach, where users manually
request replanning, and a novel "push" approach, where the server proactively
monitors and adjusts journeys. Our experiments show that the push approach
outperforms the pull approach, achieving significant speedups. The results also
reveal substantial arrival time savings enabled by dynamic replanning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于简化的小规模二维场景，忽略了现实环境中的动态和异构性，因此需要研究更复杂的三维场景以提升实际应用价值。

Result: EMFAC在仿真和实验中表现出色，优于基线方法，尤其在收敛速度和性能上。

Conclusion: EMFAC框架为复杂边界防御问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile
technologies, perimeter-defense game between attackers and defenders for the
protection of critical regions have become increasingly complex and
strategically significant across a wide range of domains. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on small-scale, simplified two-dimensional
scenarios, often overlooking realistic environmental perturbations, motion
dynamics, and inherent heterogeneity--factors that pose substantial challenges
to real-world applicability. To bridge this gap, we investigate large-scale
heterogeneous perimeter-defense game in a three-dimensional setting,
incorporating realistic elements such as motion dynamics and wind fields. We
derive the Nash equilibrium strategies for both attackers and defenders,
characterize the victory regions, and validate our theoretical findings through
extensive simulations. To tackle large-scale heterogeneous control challenges
in defense strategies, we propose an Embedded Mean-Field Actor-Critic (EMFAC)
framework. EMFAC leverages representation learning to enable high-level action
aggregation in a mean-field manner, supporting scalable coordination among
defenders. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight agent-level attention
mechanism based on reward representation, which selectively filters
observations and mean-field information to enhance decision-making efficiency
and accelerate convergence in large-scale tasks. Extensive simulations across
varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of EMFAC, which
outperforms established baselines in both convergence speed and overall
performance. To further validate practicality, we test EMFAC in small-scale
real-world experiments and conduct detailed analyses, offering deeper insights
into the framework's effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLVR和蒸馏如何塑造语言模型的推理行为，强调需更可靠的回答质量指标。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) enhances overall accuracy but fails to improve capability, while
distillation can improve both. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms
behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR does not improve
capability because it focuses on improving the accuracy of the less-difficult
questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions,
thereby leading to no improvement in capability. Second, we find that RLVR does
not merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions,
but in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in
its output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses
are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords,
underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third,
we show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong
reasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is
introduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new
knowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the
detriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these
findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape
reasoning behavior in language models.

TL;DR: EVA是一个针对间接提示注入攻击的红队框架，通过动态优化攻击策略，显著提高了攻击成功率和跨场景适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态代理在图形用户界面（GUI）中的使用增加，间接提示注入攻击的威胁日益严重，需要一种动态优化的方法来应对。

Method: EVA通过持续监控代理在GUI上的注意力分布，动态更新对抗性提示、关键词、措辞和布局，形成一个闭环优化过程。

Result: 在多种GUI场景中，EVA显著提高了攻击成功率，并揭示了GUI代理的共同行为偏差。

Conclusion: EVA不仅是一种有效的红队工具，还能揭示多模态代理决策中的共同漏洞。

Abstract: As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from
indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are
embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages,
and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is
environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence
agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these
emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt
injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by
continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and
updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response.
Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard
for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to
emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates
and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA
on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings
such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email
composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success
rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the
attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective
patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models,
revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that
evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming
agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal
decision making.

Result: Safety-Net在检测有害行为时准确率达96%，即使信息在表示空间中转移也能有效识别。

Conclusion: Safety-Net框架能有效监测LLM的有害输出，解决了因果指标识别和模型欺骗问题，为AI安全提供了实用工具。

Abstract: High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to
detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs)
need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful
AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats
normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study
focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input
phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe
content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key
challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface
correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately
evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an
unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans
exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display
distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our
study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that
capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and
2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our
findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms
and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear
representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we
developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different
representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when
information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual
monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using
our unsupervised ensemble approach.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), rich document analysis technologies for
applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and visual RAG are
gaining significant attention. Recent research indicates that using VLMs can
achieve better RAG performance, but processing rich documents still remains a
challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this
paper, we present SCAN (\textbf{S}emanti\textbf{C} Document Layout
\textbf{AN}alysis), a novel approach enhancing both textual and visual
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems working with visually rich
documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components
with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with
processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that
divides documents into coherent regions covering continuous components. We
trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models with
sophisticated annotation datasets. Our experimental results across English and
Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual
RAG performance by up to 9.0\% and visual RAG performance by up to 6.4\%,
outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing
solutions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在搜索引导、BoN和F1分数等指标上优于现有PRM和开源数据集训练的PRM，数据效率和性能均更优。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了PRM在长链推理中的性能，具有稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs.
However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT
reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and
all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These
methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent
in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial
reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation
method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process.
Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often
alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation,
enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors
and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for
annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate
it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets,
our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search
guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation
methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but
also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to
demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱的方法，用于改进代码搜索和检索，从而在仓库级任务中提升代码生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成方面表现出色，但在上下文准确性（尤其是动态代码库中）方面仍有不足。现有的代码搜索和检索方法在结果质量和上下文相关性上缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将代码仓库表示为知识图谱，捕捉结构和关系信息，采用混合方法进行代码检索，以提高上下文相关性、跟踪模块依赖关系并生成更鲁棒的代码。

Result: 在Evolutionary Code Benchmark（EvoCodeBench）数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的代码生成方法有望推动鲁棒且上下文敏感的编码辅助工具的发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code
generation from natural language queries. However, despite their extensive
knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with
contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search
and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and
contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code
generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to
improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation
in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code
repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for
enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach
for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular
dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the
existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code
Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark,
and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline
approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation
could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal Cartographer框架，通过显式提取和建模因果关系，解决现有基础模型（如LLMs）在因果推理任务中的不足，并提升其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如LLMs）缺乏因果推理能力，且难以评估反事实问题。论文旨在通过建模因果关系，提升模型在因果推理任务中的表现。

Method: 提出Causal Cartographer框架，包括图检索增强生成代理和反事实推理代理，用于提取因果关系并构建反事实推理。

Result: 该方法能有效提取因果知识，提升LLMs在因果推理任务中的鲁棒性，同时降低推理成本和虚假相关性。

Conclusion: Causal Cartographer框架为因果推理任务提供了有效解决方案，弥补了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Causal world models are systems that can answer counterfactual questions
about an environment of interest, i.e. predict how it would have evolved if an
arbitrary subset of events had been realized differently. It requires
understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting
causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes
foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have
demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing
causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world
applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting
evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly
extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal
Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented
generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This
approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal
relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build
real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning
agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step
causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and
improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing
inference costs and spurious correlations.

Result: 在数学/编程推理任务上超越基线，样本效率提升，且具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: BCPG-NSA有效挖掘负样本中的学习信号，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Motivation: 有效提示工程是充分发挥LLM潜力的关键，但传统方法依赖专家直觉和任务理解，难以捕捉细微语义线索。

Method: 提出PRL，一种基于强化学习的自动提示生成方法，能够生成训练中未见的少样本示例。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：分类任务超越APE 2.58%和EvoPrompt 1.00%；摘要任务ROUGE分数分别提升4.32和2.12；简化任务SARI分数提升6.93和6.01。

Conclusion: PRL为自动提示生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM性能。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a central challenge in fully harnessing
the capabilities of LLMs. While well-designed prompts can dramatically enhance
performance, crafting them typically demands expert intuition and a nuanced
understanding of the task. Moreover, the most impactful prompts often hinge on
subtle semantic cues, ones that may elude human perception but are crucial for
guiding LLM behavior. In this paper, we introduce PRL (Prompts from
Reinforcement Learning), a novel RL-based approach for automatic prompt
generation. Unlike previous methods, PRL can produce novel few-shot examples
that were not seen during training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a range of benchmarks, including text classification,
simplification, and summarization. On the classification task, it surpasses
prior methods by 2.58% over APE and 1.00% over EvoPrompt. Additionally, it
improves the average ROUGE scores on the summarization task by 4.32 over APE
and by 2.12 over EvoPrompt and the SARI score on simplification by 6.93 over
APE and by 6.01 over EvoPrompt. Our code is available at

Result: 构建了包含196K样本的大规模数据集，仅需5%的计算资源，PRMs在该数据集上表现优于现有自动标注方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE显著降低了标注成本，同时提升了PRMs的性能。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated promising results in
mathematical reasoning, but existing process annotation approaches, whether
through human annotations or Monte Carlo simulations, remain computationally
expensive. In this paper, we introduce Step COmpression for Process Estimation
(SCOPE), a novel compression-based approach that significantly reduces
annotation costs. We first translate natural language reasoning steps into code
and normalize them through Abstract Syntax Tree, then merge equivalent steps to
construct a prefix tree. Unlike simulation-based methods that waste numerous
samples on estimation, SCOPE leverages a compression-based prefix tree where
each root-to-leaf path serves as a training sample, reducing the complexity
from $O(NMK)$ to $O(N)$. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 196K
samples with only 5% of the computational resources required by previous
methods. Empirical results demonstrate that PRMs trained on our dataset
consistently outperform existing automated annotation approaches on both
Best-of-N strategy and ProcessBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在需要严格逻辑推理的领域（如数学证明生成）表现不佳，因此需要一种方法结合其生成能力和结构化组件来克服这一挑战。

Method: 方法包括：（1）检索类似问题并利用其证明指导LLM；（2）使用形式验证器评估生成证明并提供反馈，帮助修正错误。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了OpenAI o1模型的证明准确性（提升58%-70%），类似问题和验证器反馈均对提升有贡献。

Conclusion: 通过生成可证明正确结论的LLM，可以显著提升其可靠性、准确性和一致性，从而解锁需要高信任度的复杂任务和实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require
rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof
generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative
strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a
proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1)
we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a
formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping
the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both
analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More
broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could
dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking
complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require
trustworthiness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的置信度表达不准确，限制了其可靠性，需改进。

Method: 比较六种推理模型与非推理模型在六个数据集上的表现，分析慢思考行为的影响。

Result: 推理模型在33/36场景中置信度校准更优，慢思考行为是关键。

Conclusion: 慢思考行为提升置信度校准，且可通过上下文学习推广至非推理模型。

Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to
communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when
they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we
demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but
also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six
reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better
confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the
36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem
from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring
alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their
confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more
accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly
better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning
models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a
significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not
exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to
perform slow thinking via in-context learning.

Abstract: As machine learning models and autonomous agents are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes, real-world domains such as healthcare, security, finance, and
robotics, the need for transparent and trustworthy explanations has become
critical. To ensure end-to-end transparency of AI decisions, we need models
that are not only accurate but also fully explainable and human-tunable. We
introduce BACON, a novel framework for automatically training explainable AI
models for decision making problems using graded logic. BACON achieves high
predictive accuracy while offering full structural transparency and precise,
logic-based symbolic explanations, enabling effective human-AI collaboration
and expert-guided refinement. We evaluate BACON with a diverse set of
scenarios: classic Boolean approximation, Iris flower classification, house
purchasing decisions and breast cancer diagnosis. In each case, BACON provides
high-performance models while producing compact, human-verifiable decision
logic. These results demonstrate BACON's potential as a practical and
principled approach for delivering crisp, trustworthy explainable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理查询路由时，需要应对分布外查询（如无关领域、其他语言或不安全文本），因此研究了带保护的查询路由问题。

Method: 引入GQR-Bench基准测试，涵盖三个目标领域和七个数据集，对比了LLM、传统机器学习模型和词袋分类器的性能。

Result: WideMLP在准确率（88%）和速度（<4ms）上表现最佳；fastText速度最快（<1ms），LLM准确率最高（91%）但速度较慢。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对LLM的自动依赖，为实际应用提供了具体建议，并发布了GQR-Bench作为Python包。

Abstract: Query routing, the task to route user queries to different large language
model (LLM) endpoints, can be considered as a text classification problem.
However, out-of-distribution queries must be handled properly, as those could
be questions about unrelated domains, queries in other languages, or even
contain unsafe text. Here, we thus study a \emph{guarded} query routing
problem, for which we first introduce the Guarded Query Routing Benchmark
(GQR-Bench), which covers three exemplary target domains (law, finance, and
healthcare), and seven datasets to test robustness against out-of-distribution
queries. We then use GQR-Bench to contrast the effectiveness and efficiency of
LLM-based routing mechanisms (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, and Llama-3.1-8B),
standard LLM-based guardrail approaches (LlamaGuard and NVIDIA NeMo
Guardrails), continuous bag-of-words classifiers (WideMLP, fastText), and
traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost). Our results show that
WideMLP, enhanced with out-of-domain detection capabilities, yields the best
trade-off between accuracy (88\%) and speed (<4ms). The embedding-based
fastText excels at speed (<1ms) with acceptable accuracy (80\%), whereas LLMs
yield the highest accuracy (91\%) but are comparatively slow (62ms for local
Llama-3.1:8B and 669ms for remote GPT-4o-mini calls). Our findings challenge
the automatic reliance on LLMs for (guarded) query routing and provide concrete
recommendations for practical applications. GQR-Bench will be released as a
Python package -- \texttt{gqr}.

Conclusion: 该逻辑为AI代理推理人类注意力偏差提供了框架，展示了其发现注意力偏差的能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first general logic of attention. Attention is a
powerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex
information, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,
or what other agents pay attention to. This ability is a strength, as it helps
to ignore what is irrelevant, but it can also introduce biases when some types
of information or agents are systematically ignored. Existing dynamic epistemic
logics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they
only model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly
become cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents
and announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both
limitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show
to be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct
(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).
Second, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also
attend to other agents' beliefs or attention. Our work treats attention as a
modality, like belief or awareness. We introduce attention principles that
impose closure properties on that modality and that can be used in its
axiomatization. Throughout, we illustrate our framework with examples of AI
agents reasoning about human attentional biases, demonstrating how such agents
can discover attentional biases.

Motivation: 城市交通拥堵（尤其是路口）严重影响出行时间、燃油消耗和排放，传统固定时间信号控制系统难以适应动态交通模式。

Method: 利用Pygame模拟多路口交通网络，随机生成车辆流以反映真实交通变化，采用分散式MARL控制器，每个信号灯作为自主智能体基于局部观察和邻近信息决策。

Result: MARL控制器在平均车辆等待时间和整体通行量上显著优于固定时间控制器。

Conclusion: MARL动态控制策略对提升城市交通管理效率具有潜力，未来需研究其可扩展性和实际应用挑战。

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly
impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time
signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic
patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across
multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a
simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections
with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability.
A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal
operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations
and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a
baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time
and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically
significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved
throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies
hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency.
More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world
implementation challenges.

Result: ACP系统在长时程网络辅助任务和多媒体技术报告生成中达到最佳性能，优于商业AI系统。

Conclusion: ACP协议模块化且可扩展，能快速构建高性能通用智能体。

Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding,
reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems
requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm
where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one
another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination
is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits
complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.
We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic
family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and
error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit
dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii)
standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent
collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art
performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance
and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI
systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing
practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.

propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization,
positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully
estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder,

Result: 在数学基准测试中，SBT减少60%的token消耗，同时保持与无约束模型相当的准确性。

Conclusion: SBT通过自我调节有效解决了过思考问题，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains
of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks.
However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in
redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high
computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although
numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they
often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the
perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus
eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of
overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a
systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately
identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates
training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this
foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive
reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that
enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an
appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC,
MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to
60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

Method: SATBench通过自动化生成基于SAT公式的逻辑谜题，并转化为故事背景和条件，难度可调。所有谜题经过LLM辅助和求解器验证。

Result: 实验显示，最强模型o4-mini在困难UNSAT问题上仅达65.0%准确率，接近随机基线50%，暴露了LLMs的局限性。

Conclusion: SATBench揭示了当前LLMs在搜索式逻辑推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived
from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on
inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from
a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT
problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified
set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT
formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The
generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by
varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both
LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a
subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini,
achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random
baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based
logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for
future research in logical reasoning.

### [297] [Debating for Better Reasoning: An Unsupervised Multimodal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14627)
*Ashutosh Adhikari,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在多模态环境下通过辩论机制实现弱模型监督强模型的方法，特别是在视觉问答任务中，展示了辩论框架优于单个专家模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，其监督变得困难，尤其是在能力超越人类评估者时。辩论机制被认为是一种有潜力的解决方案。

Method: 在多模态环境中扩展辩论范式，使用两个视觉语言专家模型辩论答案，并由一个仅依赖文本的盲法官裁决。专家仅支持与其信念一致的答案。

Result: 实验表明，辩论框架在多模态任务中表现优于单个专家模型，且弱模型的判断可通过微调提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: 辩论机制在多模态监督中具有潜力，能够有效提升模型性能，并为弱模型监督强模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain expertise across diverse domains and
modalities, scalable oversight becomes increasingly challenging, particularly
when their capabilities may surpass human evaluators. Debate has emerged as a
promising mechanism for enabling such oversight. In this work, we extend the
debate paradigm to a multimodal setting, exploring its potential for weaker
models to supervise and enhance the performance of stronger models. We focus on
visual question answering (VQA), where two "sighted" expert vision-language
models debate an answer, while a "blind" (text-only) judge adjudicates based
solely on the quality of the arguments. In our framework, the experts defend
only answers aligned with their beliefs, thereby obviating the need for
explicit role-playing and concentrating the debate on instances of expert
disagreement. Experiments on several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the
debate framework consistently outperforms individual expert models. Moreover,
judgments from weaker LLMs can help instill reasoning capabilities in
vision-language models through finetuning.

*Zihao Zhang,Fei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CATS的新方法，通过结合LLM的推理能力和结构化搜索，解决了LLM在成本敏感规划中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在开放推理中表现优异，但在成本敏感规划中表现不佳，要么忽视成本差异，要么无法满足严格预算。

Method: 引入Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS)，将显式成本意识融入LLM引导的规划中。

Result: 实验表明，CATS在成本敏感场景中表现优于GPT-4.1等LLM，任务成功率和成本效率更高。

Conclusion: CATS为预算感知决策提供了有效解决方案，结合了LLM的推理能力和结构化搜索的优势。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at open-ended reasoning, they often struggle with
cost-sensitive planning, either treating all actions as having equal cost or
failing to stay within strict budgets. In this paper, we introduce
Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings
explicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push
the planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints
encourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their
performance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs
such as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently
delivers strong performance, achieving higher task success rates and better
cost efficiency. CATS provides an effective solution for budget-aware
decision-making by combining the reasoning power of LLMs with structured
search.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Minsuk Kahng,Albert No*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAFEPATH是一种轻量级对齐方法，通过在推理开始时生成8个token的安全提示来减少有害输出，同时保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法在减少有害输出的同时会降低推理深度，且在复杂任务中存在性能折衷，容易受到高级越狱攻击。

Method: SAFEPATH通过微调LRMs，在有害提示下生成简短的安全提示，其余推理过程不受监督。

Result: SAFEPATH在多个基准测试中有效减少有害输出（90.0%），并阻止83.3%的越狱攻击，计算成本显著低于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAFEPATH提供了一种高效的安全对齐方法，同时揭示了现有方法在推理中心模型中的局限性，为更安全的AI指明了新方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem
solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs
when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce
harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant
trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated
jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight
alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at
the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the
rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while
maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful
responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than
Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot
variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to
reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer
AI.

TL;DR: ContextAgent是一种上下文感知的主动代理，通过多维度感知数据增强LLM代理的主动能力，显著提升了预测和工具调用的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动代理依赖封闭环境观察或基于规则的通知，导致用户意图理解不足和功能受限，需改进。

Method: ContextAgent从可穿戴设备提取多维上下文，结合历史数据预测主动服务需求，并自动调用工具。

Result: 在ContextAgentBench上，ContextAgent在主动预测和工具调用上分别比基线高8.5%和6.0%。

Conclusion: ContextAgent为开发更先进、以人为中心的主动AI助手提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent
agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing
proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed
environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based
proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and
limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce
ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates
extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.
ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory
perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.
ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from
historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive
assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary
tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate
ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive
LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty
tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms
baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive
predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire
the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.

Motivation: 现有推理模型存在认知效率低的问题（如过度思考或思考不足），需要一种轻量级方法来提升性能。

Method: 利用归一化点互信息（nPMI）识别并强化认知专家，这些专家负责元级推理操作。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3-235B等模型上，RICE显著提升了推理准确性、认知效率和跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: RICE是一种实用且可解释的方法，能有效增强高级推理模型的认知效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)
have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating
experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances,
existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like
overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts
(RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training
or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information
(nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive
experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by
tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs
(DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning
accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our
lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering
techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving
the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight
reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable
direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有BNN研究主要关注模型权重和激活，而忽略了输入原始数据的优化。

Method: 引入GLT编码技术，学习非线性量化阈值；结合轻量级分组卷积、块剪枝和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在STL-10和VWW数据集上验证，GLT显著提升精度；结合块剪枝后，模型大小低于1Mb，适合传感器端持续推理。

Conclusion: GLT为BNN提供了多功能性，显著提升精度，同时实现轻量化和低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights
and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This
article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to
improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear
quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations
which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion
(ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a
compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to
block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore
the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings
versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping,
enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on
the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed
block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb),
fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable
for in-sensor always-on inference use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多相流问题（如液体-蒸汽流）在计算域中存在强不连续性，传统CFD模型无法快速预测，限制了工业应用。

Method: 使用神经算子训练体积流体模拟数据，预测多相流演化。

Result: 神经算子的预测时间尺度与多相应用匹配，且预测液体-蒸汽界面的精度非常高。

Conclusion: 神经算子可用于快速控制多相工业过程，填补了传统CFD模型的不足。

Abstract: Recent progress in AI has established neural operators as powerful tools that
can predict the evolution of partial differential equations, such as the
Navier-Stokes equations. Some complex problems rely on sophisticated algorithms
to deal with strong discontinuities in the computational domain. For example,
liquid-vapour multiphase flows are a challenging problem in many
configurations, particularly those involving large density gradients or phase
change. The complexity mentioned above has not allowed for fine control of fast
industrial processes or applications because computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
models do not have a quick enough forecasting ability. This work demonstrates
that the time scale of neural operators-based predictions is comparable to the
time scale of multi-phase applications, thus proving they can be used to
control processes that require fast response. Neural Operators can be trained
using experimental data, simulations or a combination. In the following, neural
operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, and the resulting
predictions showed very high accuracy, particularly in predicting the evolution
of the liquid-vapour interface, one of the most critical tasks in a multi-phase
process controller.

Motivation: 当前缺乏有效方法理解深度学习模型如何表示数据，因此需要开发新工具来揭示数据在模型中的分布和对齐情况。

Method: 通过评估网络特权基向量定义的平面周围的数据分布，提供了一种原子化和整体化的直观度量方法，并引入分辨率尺度超参数以适应不同应用。

Result: 研究发现嵌入表示倾向于与特权基对齐，激活函数直接导致特权基的形成，从而解释了表示与神经元对齐的倾向。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了表示对齐的因果关系，并发现了多种网络中的“祖母神经元”现象。

Abstract: Understanding how deep learning models represent data is currently difficult
due to the limited number of methodologies available. This paper demonstrates a
versatile and novel visualisation tool for determining the axis alignment of
embedded data at any layer in any deep learning model. In particular, it
evaluates the distribution around planes defined by the network's privileged
basis vectors. This method provides both an atomistic and a holistic, intuitive
metric for interpreting the distribution of activations across all planes. It
ensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the
activation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations
of this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to
probe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are
provided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with
the privileged basis. This is not necessarily the standard basis, and it is
found that activation functions directly result in privileged bases. Hence, it
provides a direct causal link between functional form symmetry breaking and
representational alignment, explaining why representations have a tendency to
align with the neuron basis. Therefore, using this method, we begin to answer
the fundamental question of what causes the observed tendency of
representations to align with neurons. Finally, examples of so-called
grandmother neurons are found in a variety of networks.

Abstract: We study Transformers through the perspective of optimal control theory,
using tools from continuous-time formulations to derive actionable insights
into training and architecture design. This framework improves the performance
of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical
guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed
to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer
models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct
seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment
analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental
results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines,
while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with
nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using
42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in
final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both
the training and architecture of Transformers. It offers a new foundation for
systematic, theory-driven improvements and moves beyond costly trial-and-error
approaches.

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of long-time macroscopic dynamics and
thermodynamics of dissipative systems with particle fidelity is hampered by
significant obstacles. These include the strong time-scale limitations inherent
to particle simulations, the non-uniqueness of the thermodynamic potentials and
operators from given macroscopic dynamics, and the need for efficient
uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces Statistical-Physics Informed
Epistemic Diffusion Models (SPIEDiff), a machine learning framework designed to
overcome these limitations in the context of purely dissipative systems by
leveraging statistical physics, conditional diffusion models, and epinets. We
evaluate the proposed framework on stochastic Arrhenius particle processes and
demonstrate that SPIEDiff can accurately uncover both thermodynamics and
kinetics, while enabling reliable long-time macroscopic predictions using only
short-time particle simulation data. SPIEDiff can deliver accurate predictions
with quantified uncertainty in minutes, drastically reducing the computational
demand compared to direct particle simulations, which would take days or years
in the examples considered. Overall, SPIEDiff offers a robust and trustworthy
pathway for the data-driven discovery of thermodynamic models.

Motivation: 开放集域适应（OSDA）需要同时对齐已知类分布并识别目标域中的未知类别，现有方法未能充分利用模态间的语义关系且易受未知样本检测误差累积影响。

Method: 采用CLIP，提出两种创新：1）基于提示的跨域对齐，通过可学习文本提示动态调整文本编码器；2）梯度感知开放集分离，通过梯度分析模块量化域偏移。

Result: 在Office-Home数据集上，方法显著优于CLIP基线和标准基线，梯度分析模块的作用得到验证。

Conclusion: 通过结合CLIP的动态提示和梯度分析，有效解决了OSDA中的挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) confronts the dual challenge of aligning
known-class distributions across domains while identifying
target-domain-specific unknown categories. Current approaches often fail to
leverage semantic relationships between modalities and struggle with error
accumulation in unknown sample detection. We propose to harness Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to address these limitations through two key
innovations: 1) Prompt-driven cross-domain alignment: Learnable textual prompts
conditioned on domain discrepancy metrics dynamically adapt CLIP's text
encoder, enabling semantic consistency between source and target domains
without explicit unknown-class supervision. 2) Gradient-aware open-set
separation: A gradient analysis module quantifies domain shift by comparing the
L2-norm of gradients from the learned prompts, where known/unknown samples
exhibit statistically distinct gradient behaviors. Evaluations on Office-Home
show that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard
baseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role.

Method: 通过回顾文献，分析可解释性ML的定义和方法，提出适用于物理科学的可解释性定义。

Result: 指出稀疏性并非可解释性的必要条件，强调机制理解的重要性，并质疑在缺乏先验知识时实现可解释科学发现的可能性。

Conclusion: 提出精确且哲学上合理的可解释性定义，有助于推动SciML研究解决关键障碍。

Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used
to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among
scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come
packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the
neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge.
Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have
converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from
more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability
has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive
models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of
interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the
precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this
work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression
tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key
papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue
that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of
interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting
these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability
for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes
understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it
may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary.
It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when
prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed
definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward
the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.

TL;DR: LoRASuite提出了一种模块化方法，利用现有LoRA权重适应新版LLM，避免从头训练，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM频繁更新，传统从头训练LoRA权重成本高、耗时长且不环保，需高效利用现有权重适应新模型。

Method: 通过计算转移矩阵、基于对齐和相似度分配层与注意力头，并进行小规模微调以确保稳定性。

Result: LoRASuite在MiniCPM和Qwen等模型上表现优于小规模LoRA方法，数学任务平均提升1.4和6.6分，同时减少内存和计算时间。

Conclusion: LoRASuite高效适应新版LLM，性能优于传统方法，显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated, LoRA weights trained
on earlier versions quickly become obsolete. The conventional practice of
retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly,
time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity
of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: "How
can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model
versions?" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored
specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer
matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate
corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and
cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful
fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA
methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even
exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average
improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally,
LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational
time by 78.23%.

### [313] [Zero-Shot Forecasting Mortality Rates: A Global Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13521)
*Gabor Petnehazi,Laith Al Shaggah,Jozsef Gall,Bernadett Aradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了零样本时间序列预测在死亡率预测中的潜力，评估了两种预训练基础模型（TimesFM和CHRONOS）与传统方法的表现。CHRONOS在短期预测中表现优异，而TimesFM表现不佳。微调CHRONOS显著提升长期预测准确性，随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零样本时间序列预测在死亡率预测中的应用潜力，避免任务特定的微调需求。

Method: 评估TimesFM和CHRONOS两种预训练基础模型，与传统方法（如ARIMA和Lee-Carter模型）及机器学习方法（随机森林）对比，使用50个国家111个年龄组的数据，预测5、10和20年的死亡率。

Result: CHRONOS在短期预测中优于传统方法，TimesFM表现不佳；微调CHRONOS提升长期预测准确性；随机森林模型整体表现最佳。

Conclusion: 零样本预测具有潜力，但需谨慎选择模型并进行领域适应；随机森林在死亡率预测中表现最优。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of zero-shot time series forecasting, an
innovative approach leveraging pre-trained foundation models, to forecast
mortality rates without task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate two
state-of-the-art foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, alongside traditional
and machine learning-based methods across three forecasting horizons (5, 10,
and 20 years) using data from 50 countries and 111 age groups. In our
investigations, zero-shot models showed varying results: while CHRONOS
delivered competitive shorter-term forecasts, outperforming traditional methods
like ARIMA and the Lee-Carter model, TimesFM consistently underperformed.
Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term
accuracy. A Random Forest model, trained on mortality data, achieved the best
overall performance. These findings underscore the potential of zero-shot
forecasting while highlighting the need for careful model selection and
domain-specific adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MTLA通过压缩KV缓存和动态合并相邻向量，显著减少自注意力推理的内存占用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer自注意力的KV缓存随序列长度线性增长，成为推理效率的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MTLA，利用超网络动态合并相邻KV缓存向量，并引入步长感知因果掩码确保训练与推理一致性。

Result: 在多个任务中，MTLA性能与标准MHA相当，但推理速度提升5.3倍，GPU内存占用减少8.3倍。

Conclusion: MTLA在保持性能的同时显著优化了推理效率和内存使用。

Abstract: While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value
(KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for
inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to
compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes
Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache
size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of
self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge
temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the
compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask
is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with
inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation,
speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate
that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head
Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage.
For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x
speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA,
while maintaining translation quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPrLLM是一个联邦剪枝框架，用于在保护隐私的前提下压缩大语言模型（LLM），通过客户端本地计算剪枝掩码矩阵并与服务器共享，实现全局模型的协作剪枝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM剪枝方法通常需要公开校准样本，这在隐私敏感领域难以获取。FedPrLLM旨在解决这一问题，实现隐私保护的LLM压缩。

Method: FedPrLLM框架中，客户端基于本地校准数据计算剪枝掩码矩阵并共享给服务器，服务器据此剪枝全局模型。实验探索了不同剪枝策略和权重缩放选项。

Result: 实验表明，FedPrLLM框架中，一次性剪枝结合层级比较且不缩放权重是最优选择。

Conclusion: FedPrLLM为隐私敏感领域的LLM剪枝提供了有效解决方案，并有望指导未来研究。

Abstract: LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs,
enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current
methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can
be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue,
we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for
the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs
to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and
share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for
collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client
while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive
experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework,
including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to
scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with
layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the
FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning
LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraDelta是一种无需数据的delta压缩方法，通过分层稀疏分配、分布感知压缩和全局重缩放，实现超高压缩和强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有delta压缩方法在存储多任务微调模型时无法同时实现高压缩和高性能的问题。

Method: 提出三种关键技术：基于方差的混合稀疏分配、分布感知压缩和迹范数引导的重缩放。

Result: 在多种模型（LLaMA-2、RoBERTa、ViT等）上实现超高压缩比（最高800x），性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraDelta是一种高效、无需数据的delta压缩方案，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous
fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta
compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly
compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained
model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high
compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these
challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression
pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.
UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and
stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,
using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation
assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance
layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression
applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by
group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)
Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a
global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.
Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2
7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base)
with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and
(d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that
UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under
ultra-high compression.

TL;DR: 论文研究了动态环境中的决策导向学习（DFL），提出了一种在线算法，通过正则化和乐观原则处理目标函数和数据分布变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DFL研究仅关注静态数据和固定目标函数，而动态环境中的DFL更具挑战性，因为目标函数可能无梯度或非凸。

Method: 通过正则化使目标函数可微，并利用乐观原则和近优预言机设计在线算法。

Result: 算法在单纯形和有界凸多面体决策空间上实现了动态遗憾的期望界限。

Conclusion: 实验表明，该算法在动态环境中优于传统的预测导向方法。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for
training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks.
Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to
directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. This
end-to-end strategy holds promise for tackling complex combinatorial problems;
however, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data
is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead
investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data
distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging because the
objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of
standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To
address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it
differentiable and (ii) make use of the optimism principle, based on a
near-optimal oracle along with an appropriate perturbation. This leads to a
practical online algorithm for which we establish bounds on the expected
dynamic regret, both when the decision space is a simplex and when it is a
general bounded convex polytope. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm by comparing its performance with a classic prediction-focused
approach on a simple knapsack experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的学习发生在闭环环境中，而传统RNN训练多依赖开环监督设置，因此需要研究闭环环境下的学习动态。

Method: 开发了描述线性RNN在闭环环境中学习动态的数学理论，并通过实验验证了其与开环训练的差异。

Result: 闭环RNN的学习动态受短期策略改进和长期稳定性的双重目标驱动，与开环训练轨迹显著不同。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在生物合理环境中建模闭环动态的重要性，为理解大脑计算提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer
powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely
on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in
closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the
learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first
demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or
open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this
divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing
distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically,
we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to
open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives:
short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment
interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task,
highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore
the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible
setting.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于等变卷积自编码器和等变卷积LSTM的端到端替代模型，用于建模和控制大规模物理系统，以三维Rayleigh-Bénard对流为例，展示了在样本和参数效率上的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模物理系统（如流体力学和气候建模）因其高自由度和复杂多尺度动力学，对机器学习的准确性和样本效率提出了挑战。

Method: 采用G-可操纵核的等变卷积自编码器和等变卷积LSTM构建模型，利用D4-可操纵核的垂直堆叠层和部分核共享提高效率。

Result: 模型在样本和参数效率上表现显著提升，并能更好地扩展到更复杂的动力学（如更大的Rayleigh数）。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模物理系统的建模和控制提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling
large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples
ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and
magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems --
governed by partial differential equations -- present unique challenges
regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over
many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy
and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end
equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional
autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels.
As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated
bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the
horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance
in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers
of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the
vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. Our results demonstrate
significant gains both in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better
scaling to more complex dynamics, that is, larger Rayleigh numbers. The
accompanying code is available under

There are many different concepts, like single shot detectors, that have been
published for detecting objects in images or video streams. However, CNNs
suffer from disadvantages regarding the deployment on embedded platforms such
as re-configurable hardware like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Due to
the high computational intensity, memory requirements and arithmetic

developed. The following methods showcase our best practice approaches for a
TinyYOLOv3 detector network on a XILINX Artix-7 FPGA using techniques like
fusion of batch normalization, filter pruning and post training network
quantization.

TL;DR: FlexFed是一种针对联邦学习（FL）中灾难性遗忘（CF）问题的新方法，特别适用于资源受限的人体活动识别（HAR）环境。它通过动态调整训练频率和优化数据保留策略，显著提升了FL的效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAR环境中数据分布非平稳且客户端参与间歇性，导致现有FL方法面临灾难性遗忘问题。隐私限制排除了传统连续学习（CL）方法的使用。

Method: FlexFed通过动态调整离线训练频率和优化数据保留策略来缓解CF，并引入新指标量化CF。

Result: 实验表明，FlexFed有效缓解CF，提升FL效率10-15%，并实现更快、更稳定的收敛。

Conclusion: FlexFed为HAR环境中的FL提供了一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案，显著改善了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
privacy by allowing clients to share model updates instead of raw data.
Pervasive computing environments (e.g., for Human Activity Recognition, HAR),
which we focus on in this paper, are characterized by resource-constrained end
devices, streaming sensor data and intermittent client participation.
Variations in user behavior, common in HAR environments, often result in
non-stationary data distributions. As such, existing FL approaches face
challenges in HAR settings due to differing assumptions. The combined effects
of HAR characteristics, namely heterogeneous data and intermittent
participation, can lead to a severe issue called catastrophic forgetting (CF).
Unlike Continuous Learning (CL), which addresses CF using memory and replay
mechanisms, FL's privacy constraints prohibit such strategies.
  To tackle CF in HAR environments, we propose FlexFed, a novel FL approach
that prioritizes data retention for efficient memory use and dynamically
adjusts offline training frequency based on distribution shifts, client
capability and offline duration. To better quantify CF in FL, we introduce a
new metric that accounts for under-represented data, enabling more accurate
evaluations. We also develop a realistic HAR-based evaluation framework that
simulates streaming data, dynamic distributions, imbalances and varying
availability. Experiments show that FlexFed mitigates CF more effectively,
improves FL efficiency by 10 to 15 % and achieves faster, more stable
convergence, especially for infrequent or under-represented data.

Motivation: 研究在全局对称群下不变的成本函数优化问题，适用于机器学习、成像和逆问题。

Method: 通过最小化辅助能量泛函得到规范场，构造输入信号的变形，证明成本沿此方向严格下降。

Result: 在温和正则条件下，成本严格下降，退化集为零高斯测度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型梯度或标签，为黑盒模型和对称约束任务提供了优化工具。

Abstract: We study the problem of reducing a task cost functional $W(S)$, defined over
Sobolev-class signals $S$, when the cost is invariant under a global symmetry
group $G \subset \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ and accessible only as a black-box. Such
scenarios arise in machine learning, imaging, and inverse problems, where cost
metrics reflect model outputs or performance scores but are non-differentiable
and model-internal. We propose a variational method that exploits the symmetry
structure to construct explicit, symmetry-breaking deformations of the input
signal. A gauge field $\phi$, obtained by minimizing an auxiliary energy
functional, induces a deformation $h = A_\phi[S]$ that generically lies
transverse to the $G$-orbit of $S$. We prove that, under mild regularity, the
cost $W$ strictly decreases along this direction -- either via Clarke
subdifferential descent or by escaping locally flat plateaus. The exceptional
set of degeneracies has zero Gaussian measure. Our approach requires no access
to model gradients or labels and operates entirely at test time. It provides a
principled tool for optimizing invariant cost functionals via Lie-algebraic
variational flows, with applications to black-box models and
symmetry-constrained tasks.

Result: OMGPT在多个任务中表现出色，理论分析表明其性能与预训练任务多样性和测试任务差异相关。

Conclusion: OMGPT为运营决策任务提供了新的范式，结合预训练和直接映射的优势。

Abstract: We build a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch to
solve sequential decision making tasks arising in contexts of operations
research and management science which we call OMGPT. We first propose a general
sequence modeling framework to cover several operational decision making tasks
as special cases, such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, resource
allocation, and queueing control. Under the framework, all these tasks can be
viewed as a sequential prediction problem where the goal is to predict the
optimal future action given all the historical information. Then we train a
transformer-based neural network model (OMGPT) as a natural and powerful
architecture for sequential modeling. This marks a paradigm shift compared to
the existing methods for these OR/OM tasks in that (i) the OMGPT model can take
advantage of the huge amount of pre-trained data; (ii) when tackling these
problems, OMGPT does not assume any analytical model structure and enables a
direct and rich mapping from the history to the future actions. Either of these
two aspects, to the best of our knowledge, is not achieved by any existing
method. We establish a Bayesian perspective to theoretically understand the
working mechanism of the OMGPT on these tasks, which relates its performance
with the pre-training task diversity and the divergence between the testing
task and pre-training tasks. Numerically, we observe a surprising performance
of the proposed model across all the above tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the sample dependence of critical points for neural

associates a parameter of one network with a set of parameters of another, thus
defining sample-dependent and sample-independent lifted critical points. We

Result: 在DARTS搜索空间上，内存消耗减少81%，同时保持相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了One-Shot NAS的高内存需求问题，提升了搜索效率。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating
architecture design. One-Shot NAS techniques, such as DARTS, have gained
substantial popularity due to their combination of search efficiency with
simplicity of implementation. By design, One-Shot methods have high GPU memory
requirements during the search. To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the
search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and
search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise
Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the
search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space.
Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces
memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while
achieving the same level of accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习中度量张量的高效估计提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: The high dimensional parameter space of modern deep neural networks -- the
neuromanifold -- is endowed with a unique metric tensor defined by the Fisher
information, estimating which is crucial for both theory and practical methods
in deep learning. To analyze this tensor for classification networks, we return
to a low dimensional space of probability distributions -- the core space --
and carefully analyze the spectrum of its Riemannian metric. We extend our
discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the
neuromanifold. We introduce an unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor
and its bounds based on Hutchinson's trace estimator. It can be evaluated
efficiently through a single backward pass and can be used to estimate the
diagonal, or block diagonal, or the full tensor. Its quality is guaranteed with
a standard deviation bounded by the true value up to scaling.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their

symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however,
often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation,
measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant
models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a
principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully
symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a
restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where
an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem
into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a
constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant
model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual
tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven
equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across
multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance
metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with
strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.

TL;DR: 论文提出Peer Elicitation Games (PEG)，一种无需训练的游戏理论框架，通过生成器和多个判别器的互动，激励大语言模型（LLMs）生成更真实的内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）虽具备强大生成能力，但易产生不一致和幻觉内容，需要一种无需监督或微调的方法来提升其真实性。

Method: 采用PEG框架，通过生成器与多个判别器的互动，利用基于行列式的互信息分数计算奖励，激励真实报告。

Result: 理论证明和实验评估表明，PEG能显著提升LLMs的事实准确性，并收敛到稳定的纳什均衡。

Conclusion: PEG是一种无需监督或微调的实用方法，能有效激励LLMs生成更真实的内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer
Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning
LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple
discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact
in a peer evaluation setting, where rewards are computed using a
determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful
reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical
guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear
regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best
fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate
convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies
used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical
evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in
factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for
eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.

complex, zero-sum board game. Warhammer 40,000 features intricate rules,
requiring human players to thoroughly read and understand over 50 pages of
detailed natural language rules, grasp the interactions between their game
pieces and those of their opponents, and independently track and communicate
the evolving game state.

Motivation: 联邦学习模型因训练与部署间的分布偏移导致性能下降，现有测试时适应方法在联邦学习中面临计算开销、隐私风险和可扩展性挑战。

Method: FedCTTA利用基于噪声样本输出的相似性感知聚合，避免直接特征共享，并通过最小化客户端熵实现持续适应。

Result: 实验表明，FedCTTA在时空异构场景中优于现有方法，且无需服务器端训练，内存占用恒定。

Conclusion: FedCTTA为联邦学习提供了一种高效、隐私保护的测试时适应解决方案，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL models often suffer performance
degradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to
adapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face
challenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing,
and scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these
limitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a
privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated
adaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics,
FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware
aggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise
samples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data
privacy. Furthermore, FedCTTA minimizes the entropy at each client for
continual adaptation, enhancing the model's confidence in evolving target
distributions. Our method eliminates the need for server-side training during
adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, making it scalable even
as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments
show that FedCTTA surpasses existing methods across diverse temporal and
spatial heterogeneity scenarios.

Result: 实验验证了该方法加速了泰勒模式，性能优于嵌套反向传播。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学机器学习中的PDE算子计算提供了高效解决方案，且易于集成到机器学习编译器中。

Abstract: Computing partial differential equation (PDE) operators via nested
backpropagation is expensive, yet popular, and severely restricts their utility
for scientific machine learning. Recent advances, like the forward Laplacian
and randomizing Taylor mode automatic differentiation (AD), propose forward
schemes to address this. We introduce an optimization technique for Taylor mode
that 'collapses' derivatives by rewriting the computational graph, and
demonstrate how to apply it to general linear PDE operators, and randomized
Taylor mode. The modifications simply require propagating a sum up the
computational graph, which could -- or should -- be done by a machine learning
compiler, without exposing complexity to users. We implement our collapsing
procedure and evaluate it on popular PDE operators, confirming it accelerates
Taylor mode and outperforms nested backpropagation.

Result: 在多种图分类任务中，SRGCL作为插件模块显著优于现有方法，展示了其跨领域的适应性和高效性。

Conclusion: SRGCL通过自增强机制有效解决了正样本对质量问题，为图对比学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world
domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by
capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based
learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant
attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph
representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs.
However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so
that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are
preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL
(Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages
the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality
positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing
multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold
hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting
a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively
refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power
improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks
demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across
various domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了基于强化学习（RL）的大语言模型（LLM）后训练方法，指出其简化假设（如将状态建模为上下文窗口和动作的拼接）导致RL框架与监督学习效果相当。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在批判性地评估RL后训练LLM的假设和方法，揭示其可能的不合理性和误导性。

Method: 通过分析RL框架中的结构假设（如状态和奖励分配），并与监督学习对比，实验验证了简化假设的影响。

Result: 实验表明，监督微调（结合正负样本）在GSM8K和Countdown基准上表现与GRPO相当，且RL可能间接鼓励生成长序列。

Conclusion: RL虽可能提升LLM推理能力，但当前的结构假设和框架解释存在问题，需重新审视。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs)
has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek
R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved
reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the
formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting
the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't
quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions
include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with
states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs
and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the
trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these
simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an
outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including
GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised
fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves
performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the
structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer
sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL
generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful
technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows
that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP
render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Abstract: This study focus in the construction of an unsupervised anomaly detection

the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is
intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the
user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must,
additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the
detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.

Result: 在12个D4RL MuJoCo任务和3个随机Tokamak控制任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了离线MBRL的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for
data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL
(MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a
surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential
generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL
methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by
maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy
to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective
mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for
effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via
offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial
noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To
address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model
alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving
robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which
we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide
theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally
efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL
MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 高斯过程在大规模数据集上的推断因计算复杂度高而难以扩展，需要一种高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用近似、分布式、加速的sketch-and-project算法（ADASAP），并利用行列式点过程理论证明其收敛性。

Result: ADASAP在多个基准数据集和贝叶斯优化任务中优于现有方法，并能处理超过3亿样本的数据集。

Conclusion: ADASAP是一种高效且可扩展的高斯过程推断算法，适用于大规模数据。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific
machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide
probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference
struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications),
since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales
quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an
approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm
($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves
scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that
the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true
posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition
number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral
basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference.
$\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate
gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a
large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a
dataset with $> 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished
in the literature.

Motivation: 探索如何在大规模模型训练中优化超参数设置，以提高预训练效率。

Method: 通过分析AdamW时间尺度（B/(ηλD)）的缩放规律，验证并提出了基于D/N的幂律关系，用于预测最优超参数。

Result: 发现最优权重衰减λ随批量大小B线性变化，而最优批量和临界批量大小与数据集大小D呈幂律关系，与模型大小N无关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际训练中如何选择Pareto最优的模型大小和数据集大小提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs),
including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling
laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset
size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale,
B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we
verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a
fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise
power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a
method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training.
We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest
loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further
data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find
both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N.
Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of
Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

Abstract: We introduce a novel resampling criterion using lift scores, for improving

evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then
compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our
key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the
original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules.
We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational
overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that lift scores significantly improved the
condition alignment for compositional generation across 2D synthetic data,
CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis. Our code is available at

Abstract: The problem of data non-stationarity is commonly addressed in data stream
processing. In a dynamic environment, methods should continuously be ready to
analyze time-varying data -- hence, they should enable incremental training and
respond to concept drifts. An equally important variability typical for
non-stationary data stream environments is the emergence of new, previously
unknown classes. Often, methods focus on one of these two phenomena --
detection of concept drifts or detection of novel classes -- while both
difficulties can be observed in data streams. Additionally, concerning
previously unknown observations, the topic of open set of classes has become
particularly important in recent years, where the goal of methods is to
efficiently classify within known classes and recognize objects outside the
model competence. This article presents a strategy for synthetic data stream
generation in which both concept drifts and the emergence of new classes
representing unknown objects occur. The presented research shows how
unsupervised drift detectors address the task of detecting novelty and concept
drifts and demonstrates how the generated data streams can be utilized in the
open set recognition task.

Abstract: We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum
Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our
method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a
learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion
event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a
single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's
radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various
dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art MaxIS
methods for static graphs, including a mixed integer programming solver,
deterministic rule-based algorithms, and a heuristic learning framework based
on dynamic programming and GNNs. Across synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs
of 100-10,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with
excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art heuristic learning framework in solution quality, runtime, and
memory usage. Our model generalizes well on graphs 100x larger than the ones
used for training, achieving performance at par with both a greedy technique
and a commercial mixed integer programming solver while running 1.5-23x faster
than greedy.

Result: Panda在未训练的真实混沌系统中表现零样本预测能力，并能预测偏微分方程。

Conclusion: 预训练模型在非线性动力学等抽象数学领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging
efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical
systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either
specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation
models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical
structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched
Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic,
extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we
discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data,
Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world
chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention
heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary
differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict
partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural
scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of
pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear
dynamics.

Motivation: 直接验证替代损失的校准性可能很困难，因此需要更易验证的条件（如IE）来确保统计一致性。

Result: 证明强IE对可微替代损失隐含校准性，并对强凸可微损失是充要条件。

Conclusion: 强IE为设计和分析一致的可微替代损失提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The statistical consistency of surrogate losses for discrete prediction tasks
is often checked via the condition of calibration. However, directly verifying
calibration can be arduous. Recent work shows that for polyhedral surrogates, a
less arduous condition, indirect elicitation (IE), is still equivalent to
calibration. We give the first results of this type for non-polyhedral
surrogates, specifically the class of convex differentiable losses. We first
prove that under mild conditions, IE and calibration are equivalent for
one-dimensional losses in this class. We construct a counter-example that shows
that this equivalence fails in higher dimensions. This motivates the
introduction of strong IE, a strengthened form of IE that is equally easy to
verify. We establish that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable
surrogates and is both necessary and sufficient for strongly convex,
differentiable surrogates. Finally, we apply these results to a range of
problems to demonstrate the power of IE and strong IE for designing and

*Hainan Xu,Vladimir Bataev,Lilit Grigoryan,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WIND是一种通过并行处理窗口内多帧加速RNN-T推理的新策略，保持模型精度同时显著提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN-T推理按帧顺序处理效率低，WIND旨在通过并行处理窗口内多帧加速推理。

Method: WIND采用窗口内多帧并行处理，支持贪心解码、批量贪心解码及新型波束搜索解码。

Result: 实验显示，贪心模式下速度提升2.4倍且WER不变；波束搜索精度略优且速度显著提升。

Conclusion: WIND是一种高效且开源的RNN-T推理加速方案，适用于多种解码场景。

Abstract: We propose Windowed Inference for Non-blank Detection (WIND), a novel
strategy that significantly accelerates RNN-T inference without compromising
model accuracy. During model inference, instead of processing frames
sequentially, WIND processes multiple frames simultaneously within a window in
parallel, allowing the model to quickly locate non-blank predictions during
decoding, resulting in significant speed-ups. We implement WIND for greedy
decoding, batched greedy decoding with label-looping techniques, and also
propose a novel beam-search decoding method. Experiments on multiple datasets
with different conditions show that our method, when operating in greedy modes,
speeds up as much as 2.4X compared to the baseline sequential approach while
maintaining identical Word Error Rate (WER) performance. Our beam-search
algorithm achieves slightly better accuracy than alternative methods, with
significantly improved speed. We will open-source our WIND implementation.

Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement
learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and
online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm
and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms
with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone
and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e.,
sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our
algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where
$\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$
are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret
minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}(
\sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure
online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability
coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an
interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline
dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further
validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models
such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).

<details>

Motivation: 批判性地检验CoT的解释，探究中间推理步骤的语义是否真正影响模型性能。

Method: 训练模型于形式化验证的推理轨迹和解决方案，评估中间步骤和最终输出的正确性，并测试噪声数据的影响。

Result: 模型即使使用正确轨迹训练，仍产生无效推理；噪声数据训练的表现与正确数据相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 中间推理步骤的准确性对解决方案影响有限，需谨慎解读CoT为人类或算法行为的证据。

Abstract: Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted
as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), and especially of the process of
training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs in order to help find new reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by
investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized
as "thoughts" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors
like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance.
We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and
solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with
those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal
interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we
systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of
intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally
influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the
solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce
invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show
that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then
train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific
problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain
largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can
improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks.
These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or "Chains of
Thought" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against
anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly
correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language
models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在AI训练中引入谎言检测器的影响，发现其可能导致策略欺骗检测器而非真正诚实，但也可能在特定条件下促进诚实行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统能力增强，欺骗行为可能破坏评估并误导用户。研究旨在验证谎言检测器在训练中的实际效果。

Method: 使用DolusChat数据集，结合谎言检测器和GRPO算法，分析探索量、检测器准确性和KL正则化强度对策略诚实性的影响。

Result: 研究发现，某些条件下（如高TPR或强KL正则化），GRPO能学习诚实策略；而DPO算法在现实TPR下欺骗率低于25%。

Conclusion: 谎言检测器增强训练的效果复杂，既可能是可扩展监督的有力工具，也可能鼓励不可检测的错位行为。

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine
evaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie
detectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not
typically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination
and objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie
detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether
the learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie
detector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example
dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors
that determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during
preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We
find that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies
which evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\%. However, if the
lie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently
high, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO)
consistently lead to deception rates under 25\% for realistic TPRs. Our results
illustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the
context, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable
oversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D分子生成领域以扩散模型为主，自回归模型表现较差。Quetzal旨在通过改进自回归方法，提升生成质量和效率。

Method: Quetzal将分子视为有序原子序列，结合因果Transformer预测原子类型和扩散MLP建模位置分布，减少计算量。

Result: Quetzal在生成质量和速度上优于现有自回归基线，并与最先进的扩散模型竞争，同时支持可变大小任务。

Conclusion: Quetzal展示了自回归模型在3D分子生成中的潜力，强调了可扩展性和通用性的重要性。

Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in
the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the
space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed
behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive
model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an
ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts
the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the
continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive
baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and
is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In
addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense
transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as
exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any
architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like
hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a
perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D
molecules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型微调时因参数变化导致的性能退化（遗忘）问题，尤其是在无法访问原始训练数据的情况下。

Method: 提出上下文无关生成方法，近似无偏估计KL散度，并通过在微调数据中增加上下文无关生成数据来缓解遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持预训练模型的零样本性能和思维模型的推理性能方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 上下文无关生成是一种简单有效的缓解遗忘的方法，尤其在无法访问原始数据时。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a language model often results in a degradation of its existing
performance on other tasks, due to a shift in the model parameters; this
phenomenon is often referred to as (catastrophic) forgetting. We are interested
in mitigating this, in settings where we only have access to the model weights
but no access to its training data/recipe. A natural approach is to penalize
the KL divergence between the original model and the new one. Our main
realization is that a simple process - which we term context-free generation -
allows for an approximate unbiased estimation of this KL divergence. We show
that augmenting a fine-tuning dataset with context-free generations mitigates
forgetting, in two settings: (a) preserving the zero-shot performance of
pretrained-only models, and (b) preserving the reasoning performance of
thinking models. We show that contextual synthetic data, and even a portion of
the pretraining data, are less effective. We also investigate the effect of
choices like generation temperature, data ratios etc. We present our results
for OLMo-1B for pretrained-only setting and R1-Distill-Llama-8B for the
reasoning setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) 虽然FLOPs与传统Transformer相当，但训练速度慢123倍，限制了其在大规模任务中的应用。

Method: 通过实验分析发现KAT的瓶颈在于内存停滞和梯度累积效率低，提出FlashKAT，采用原子加法和优化内存访问的核函数。

Result: FlashKAT实现了86.5倍的训练加速，并减少了系数梯度的舍入误差。

Conclusion: FlashKAT有效解决了KAT的性能瓶颈，为大规模任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an
alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased
expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of
magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training
instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs
similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational
KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our
characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds,
indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this
paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the
slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls
and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient
gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT,
which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation
with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that
FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the
state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient
gradients. Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-STARLAB/FlashKAT.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注强对抗假设，而忽略了攻击者仅掌握部分无序信息时的威胁。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种无需数据的方法：基于似然比的攻击和PRISM（利用外部先验正则化比率）。

Result: 实验表明，这两种方法在医疗和法律场景中与基于数据的基线分类器表现相当。

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在片段信息泄露攻击下存在风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through
memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused
on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples
or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are
when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example,
if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can
they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has
"osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under
this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these
fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these
attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack
inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM,
which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples
from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive
with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled
in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

Conclusion: 分段对齐对高效可部署代理至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making
agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style
frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference
costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a
framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models
while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike
standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into
{[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each
component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables
compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments
on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently
outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant
compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further
highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable
agents.

Conclusion: 当前深度学习模型在量子系统学习中的必要性受到挑战，研究为其有效使用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental
to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in
AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and
specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies
often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets,
resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark
DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of
Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning
tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal
that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that
of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test
demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models'
prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL
models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights
into their effective utilization.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，TedTrajRec性能优越。

Conclusion: TedTrajRec通过有效建模时空动态，显著提升了轨迹恢复的精度。

Abstract: In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling
rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This
sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based
systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery,
aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous
studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder
captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target
trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network
and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall
performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage
the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the
road network.
  To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of
trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics
and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for
trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce
PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics
concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we
present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics
for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential
equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively
handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical tasks where
predictions must satisfy hard constraints, such as physical laws, fairness
requirements, or safety limits. However, standard architectures lack built-in
mechanisms to enforce such constraints, and existing approaches based on
regularization or projection are often limited to simple constraints,
computationally expensive, or lack feasibility guarantees. This paper proposes
a model-agnostic framework for enforcing input-dependent linear equality and
inequality constraints on neural network outputs. The architecture combines a
task network trained for prediction accuracy with a safe network trained using
decision rules from the stochastic and robust optimization literature to ensure
feasibility across the entire input space. The final prediction is a convex
combination of the two subnetworks, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during
both training and inference without iterative procedures or runtime
optimization. We prove that the architecture is a universal approximator of
constrained functions and derive computationally tractable formulations based
on linear decision rules. Empirical results on benchmark regression tasks show
that our method consistently satisfies constraints while maintaining
competitive accuracy and low inference latency.

Abstract: Weather forecasting has long posed a significant challenge for humanity.
While recent AI-based models have surpassed traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods in global forecasting tasks, overfitting remains a
critical issue due to the limited availability of real-world weather data
spanning only a few decades. Unlike fields like computer vision or natural
language processing, where data abundance can mitigate overfitting, weather
forecasting demands innovative strategies to address this challenge with
existing data. In this paper, we explore pre-training methods for weather
forecasting, finding that selecting an appropriately challenging pre-training
task introduces locality bias, effectively mitigating overfitting and enhancing
performance. We introduce Baguan, a novel data-driven model for medium-range
weather forecasting, built on a Siamese Autoencoder pre-trained in a
self-supervised manner and fine-tuned for different lead times. Experimental
results show that Baguan outperforms traditional methods, delivering more
accurate forecasts. Additionally, the pre-trained Baguan demonstrates robust
overfitting control and excels in downstream tasks, such as
subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) modeling and regional forecasting, after
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法在偏好对齐阶段仅利用响应输出而忽略概率信息，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出InfiFPO，通过序列级多源概率融合和概率裁剪、最大边缘融合策略，优化偏好对齐。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，InfiFPO平均性能从79.95提升至83.33，尤其在数学、编码和推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: InfiFPO通过有效融合概率信息，显著提升了模型融合和偏好优化的效果。

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different
strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training
methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for
enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods
on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs
from source models while discarding their probability information. To address
this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for
implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes
multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex
vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the
probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin
fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human
preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models.
Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO
consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization
methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average
performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its
capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

Result: 在离线和在线实验中，CRAFT表现出有效性。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过利用CFB和多模块结合，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: The past decades witness the significant advancements in time series
forecasting (TSF) across various real-world domains, including e-commerce and
disease spread prediction. However, TSF is usually constrained by the
uncertainty dilemma of predicting future data with limited past observations.
To settle this question, we explore the use of Cross-Future Behavior (CFB) in
TSF, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. We
leverage CFB features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based
Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize
the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be
predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future
behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend
and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the
cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide
Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from
higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the
distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on

### [359] [Do Language Models Use Their Depth Efficiently?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13898)
*Róbert Csordás,Christopher D. Manning,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，现代大型语言模型（如Llama 3.1和Qwen 3）并未充分利用其深度进行高效计算，而是将相同类型的计算分散到更多层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度模型是否通过增加层数实现更高阶计算，还是仅将计算分散到更多层中。

Method: 分析模型的残差流，比较子层输出，跳过层实验，以及训练浅层到深层模型的线性映射。

Result: 后半部分层贡献较小，跳过层影响小，未发现多跳任务中深度利用证据，深层模型仅分散计算。

Conclusion: 深度模型未利用层数进行新计算，仅用于更精细调整，解释了Transformer架构规模扩展收益递减现象。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance,
albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth
efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations
that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds
of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the
residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First,
comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that
layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half,
with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers
in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output
predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that
models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving
many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using
their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we
train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one.
We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other,
suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over
its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using
their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth
to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain
why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer
architectures.

*Zeyu Michael Li,Hung Anh Vu,Damilola Awofisayo,Emily Wenger*

TL;DR: 研究探讨数据集重叠和任务重叠如何影响机器学习模型的表示相似性，发现两者均与更高的表示相似性正相关，且结合时效果最强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注模型表示相似性的属性和度量，但对相似性原因的研究较少。本文旨在探索数据集重叠和任务重叠对模型相似性的影响。

Method: 通过一系列实验评估数据集重叠和任务重叠对下游模型表示相似性的影响。

Result: 发现数据集重叠和任务重叠均与更高的表示相似性正相关，且两者结合时效果最强。

Conclusion: 数据集重叠和任务重叠是模型表示相似性的重要因果因素，结合两者可进一步增强相似性。

Abstract: Numerous works have noted significant similarities in how machine learning
models represent the world, even across modalities. Although much effort has
been devoted to uncovering properties and metrics on which these models align,
surprisingly little work has explored causes of this similarity. To advance
this line of inquiry, this work explores how two possible causal factors --
dataset overlap and task overlap -- influence downstream model similarity. The
exploration of dataset overlap is motivated by the reality that large-scale
generative AI models are often trained on overlapping datasets of scraped
internet data, while the exploration of task overlap seeks to substantiate
claims from a recent work, the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, that task
similarity may drive model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors
through a broad set of experiments. We find that both positively correlate with
higher representational similarity and that combining them provides the
strongest effect. Our code and dataset are published.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文通过时间窗口比较网络状态，揭示了深度学习的两个新现象：混沌效应和锥效应，阐明了深度网络从敏感探索到稳定优化的两阶段动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度神经网络的学习机制是现代机器学习的核心挑战，现有证据表明训练动态存在明显的相变，但对其理解仍不完整。

Method: 采用时间窗口视角比较网络状态，通过注入微小参数扰动（混沌效应）和跟踪经验神经切线核（eNTK）的演化（锥效应）来分析训练动态。

Result: 发现网络对扰动的响应从混沌过渡到稳定（混沌效应），且模型的功能轨迹被限制在一个窄锥形子集中（锥效应）。

Conclusion: 混沌效应和锥效应共同揭示了深度网络从敏感探索到稳定优化的两阶段动态结构。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks learn remains a fundamental challenge
in modern machine learning. A growing body of evidence suggests that training
dynamics undergo a distinct phase transition, yet our understanding of this
transition is still incomplete. In this paper, we introduce an interval-wise
perspective that compares network states across a time window, revealing two
new phenomena that illuminate the two-phase nature of deep learning. i)
\textbf{The Chaos Effect.} By injecting an imperceptibly small parameter
perturbation at various stages, we show that the response of the network to the
perturbation exhibits a transition from chaotic to stable, suggesting there is
an early critical period where the network is highly sensitive to initial
conditions; ii) \textbf{The Cone Effect.} Tracking the evolution of the
empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK), we find that after this transition
point the model's functional trajectory is confined to a narrow cone-shaped
subset: while the kernel continues to change, it gets trapped into a tight
angular region. Together, these effects provide a structural, dynamical view of
how deep networks transition from sensitive exploration to stable refinement
during training.

*Fu Luo,Xi Lin,Mengyuan Zhong,Fei Liu,Zhenkun Wang,Jianyong Sun,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: L2C-Insert是一种基于插入范式的学习型神经组合优化方法，通过灵活插入未访问节点提升VRP问题求解质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有构造性NCO方法采用追加范式，导致结果次优，因此探索插入范式以提升灵活性和解质量。

Method: 提出L2C-Insert，包含插入位置预测模型、高效训练方案和高级推理技术。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP实验中，L2C-Insert表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: L2C-Insert通过插入范式显著提升了神经组合优化的性能。

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based
approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual
design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an
appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial
solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome
this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose
Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel
learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches,
L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any
valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance
the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three
key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position
prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an
advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's
flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances
of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior
performance across various problem sizes.

Motivation: 现有方法未能有效处理目标域中的噪声，且直接对齐高层特征导致检索性能不佳。

Method: 构建跨域关系图，利用噪声鲁棒的图流扩散模拟域间动态，结合分层Mixup操作进行渐进对齐。

Result: 实验证明COUPLE在基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: COUPLE通过噪声鲁棒性和渐进对齐，实现了高效的域自适应哈希学习。

Abstract: Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining
low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods
typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly
align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal
retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This
approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph
diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a
stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain
relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate
the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying
lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for
discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain
while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a
hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is
performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain
discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables
effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型常因学习目标与非本质特征间的虚假相关性而性能下降，现有方法依赖昂贵的组标签，难以捕捉细微偏差。

Method: 提出ShortcutProbe框架，识别潜在空间中的预测捷径，并通过重新训练使模型对这些捷径不变。

Result: 理论分析和实验证明，该框架能有效提升模型对虚假偏差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ShortcutProbe是一种高效实用的工具，无需组标签即可改善模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning
spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example,
an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously
correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely
degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious
correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a
variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group
labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail
to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for
predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias
mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed
ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential
non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is
then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for
improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the
framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical
tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Motivation: 传统最大似然估计（MLE）训练目标与任务指标（如准确性或感知质量）不一致，需要更直接的优化方法。

Result: 在文本游戏、网页导航和机器人操作等领域中，语言和视频世界模型的性能显著提升。

Conclusion: RLVR为生成模型提供了一种有前景的后训练范式，可扩展其应用范围。

Abstract: World models predict state transitions in response to actions and are
increasingly developed across diverse modalities. However, standard training
objectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with
task-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like
accuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified
framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world
modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World
evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate
substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models
across domains, including text games, web navigation, and robot manipulation.
Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models,
RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of
generative models more broadly.

Abstract: We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of
161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem
consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out
ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean
implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior
benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated
annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous
solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to
ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to
evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art
language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification,
establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and
formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale nonconvex problems, common in machine learning,
demands balancing rapid convergence with computational efficiency. First-order
(FO) stochastic methods like SVRG provide fast convergence and good
generalization but incur high costs due to full-batch gradients in large
models. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms reduce this burden using
estimated gradients, yet their slow convergence in high-dimensional settings
limits practicality. We introduce VAMO (VAriance-reduced Mixed-gradient
Optimizer), a stochastic variance-reduced method combining FO mini-batch
gradients with lightweight ZO finite-difference probes under an SVRG-style
framework. VAMO's hybrid design uses a two-point ZO estimator to achieve a
dimension-agnostic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T + 1/b)$, where $T$ is
the number of iterations and $b$ is the batch-size, surpassing the
dimension-dependent slowdown of purely ZO methods and significantly improving
over SGD's $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate. Additionally, we propose a
multi-point ZO variant that mitigates the $O(1/b)$ error by adjusting number of
estimation points to balance convergence and cost, making it ideal for a whole
range of computationally constrained scenarios. Experiments including
traditional neural network training and LLM finetuning show VAMO outperforms
established FO and ZO methods, offering a faster, more flexible option for
improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
text-attributed graph (TAG) learning. However, existing methods inadequately
handle data uncertainty in open-world scenarios, especially concerning limited
labeling and unknown-class nodes. Prior solutions typically rely on isolated
semantic or structural approaches for unknown-class rejection, lacking
effective annotation pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
Open-world Graph Assistant (OGA), an LLM-based framework that combines adaptive
label traceability, which integrates semantics and topology for unknown-class
rejection, and a graph label annotator to enable model updates using newly
annotated nodes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate OGA's effectiveness and
practicality.

Conclusion: OPEN为GNN解释性提供了更全面且无需前提条件的解决方案，显著提升了性能和适用性。

Abstract: To enhance the reliability and credibility of graph neural networks (GNNs)
and improve the transparency of their decision logic, a new field of
explainability of GNNs (XGNN) has emerged. However, two major limitations
severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing
XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs
across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b)
impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility.
To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive
and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as
the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's
sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a
distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across
different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and
analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict
prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly
complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing research on judicial sentencing prediction predominantly relies on
end-to-end models, which often neglect the inherent sentencing logic and lack
interpretability-a critical requirement for both scholarly research and
judicial practice. To address this challenge, we make three key
contributions:First, we propose a novel Saturated Mechanistic Sentencing (SMS)
model, which provides inherent legal interpretability by virtue of its
foundation in China's Criminal Law. We also introduce the corresponding
Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) adaptive algorithm for this model. Second,
for the MLMS algorithm based adaptive sentencing predictor, we establish a
mathematical theory on the accuracy of adaptive prediction without resorting to
any stationarity and independence assumptions on the data. We also provide a
best possible upper bound for the prediction accuracy achievable by the best
predictor designed in the known parameters case. Third, we construct a Chinese
Intentional Bodily Harm (CIBH) dataset. Utilizing this real-world data,
extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction
accuracy that is not far from the best possible theoretical upper bound,
validating both the model's suitability and the algorithm's accuracy.

Abstract: Although adversarial training is known to be effective against adversarial
examples, training dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we present
the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training in random deep neural
networks without any assumptions on data distributions. We introduce a new
theoretical framework based on mean field theory, which addresses the
limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework,
we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial
loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$
and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not
adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity.
We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we
present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper
bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.

Conclusion: FedGraM能有效防御无目标攻击，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables geographically distributed clients to
collaboratively train machine learning models by sharing only their local
models, ensuring data privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to untargeted attacks
that aim to degrade the global model's performance on the underlying data
distribution. Existing defense mechanisms attempt to improve FL's resilience
against such attacks, but their effectiveness is limited in practical FL
environments due to data heterogeneity. On the contrary, we aim to detect and
remove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays
a crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate
that, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing
different classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct
accuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method,
FedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server
maintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support
aggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings.
Then, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for
each local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class
separation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes
potentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms,
then averages the remaining local models to form the global model. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedGraM. Our empirical
results show that with limited data samples used to construct the auxiliary
dataset, FedGraM achieves exceptional performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art defense methods.

Conclusion: CPF为图过滤范式提供了统一框架，解决了异构图分类问题，并展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of
GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving
notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a
graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet
recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic
graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering,
which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced
adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework
unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights
into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual
Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise
filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs
exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive
parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address
the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise
Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The
method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node
partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs
feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering
on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis
is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other
paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a
real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and
practical utility.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型的推理时间扩展方法通常采用固定的去噪计划，无法根据实例难度或任务需求动态分配计算资源。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most
inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting
their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or
task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive
inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during
inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

Motivation: 离子模型因其刚性和多尺度非线性而难以用神经网络逼近，研究旨在验证FNO在高维系统中学习所有状态变量的能力。

Method: 使用FNO学习三种离子模型的动力学（FitzHugh-Nagumo、Hodgkin-Huxley、O'Hara-Rudy），并进行自动超参数调优（无约束和有约束）。

Result: FNO在所有模型中均能准确学习动力学，无约束架构训练效率更高。

Conclusion: FNO能有效捕捉高维系统的复杂多尺度动力学。

Abstract: Ionic models, described by systems of stiff ordinary differential equations,
are fundamental tools for simulating the complex dynamics of excitable cells in
both Computational Neuroscience and Cardiology. Approximating these models
using Artificial Neural Networks poses significant challenges due to their
inherent stiffness, multiscale nonlinearities, and the wide range of dynamical
behaviors they exhibit, including multiple equilibrium points, limit cycles,
and intricate interactions. While in previous studies the dynamics of the
transmembrane potential has been predicted in low dimensionality settings, in
the present study we extend these results by investigating whether Fourier
Neural Operators can effectively learn the evolution of all the state variables
within these dynamical systems in higher dimensions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach by accurately learning the dynamics of three
well-established ionic models with increasing dimensionality: the two-variable
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the
forty-one-variable O'Hara-Rudy model. To ensure the selection of near-optimal
configurations for the Fourier Neural Operator, we conducted automatic
hyperparameter tuning under two scenarios: an unconstrained setting, where the
number of trainable parameters is not limited, and a constrained case with a
fixed number of trainable parameters. Both constrained and unconstrained
architectures achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy across all the
models considered. However, the unconstrained architecture required
approximately half the number of training epochs to achieve similar error
levels, as evidenced by the loss function values recorded during training.
These results underline the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators to
accurately capture complex multiscale dynamics, even in high-dimensional
dynamical systems.

Motivation: 现有图聚类方法（如GNNs、GATs）依赖原始图结构，性能受稀疏或噪声边影响，且传统聚类技术无法充分捕捉节点间结构。

Method: DeSE框架结合深度结构熵，通过软分配计算结构熵，设计结构学习层（SLL）生成属性图，并基于GNNs的聚类分配方法（ASS）优化聚类。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上对比八种基线方法，DeSE在效果和可解释性上均表现出优越性。

Conclusion: DeSE通过量化结构信息和深度网络增强图结构，显著提升了无监督图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Research on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) provides key insights for
graph-based clustering, yet current methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and contrastive learning often rely heavily on
the original graph structure. Their performance deteriorates when the original
graph's adjacency matrix is too sparse or contains noisy edges unrelated to
clustering. Moreover, these methods depend on learning node embeddings and
using traditional techniques like k-means to form clusters, which may not fully
capture the underlying graph structure between nodes. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces DeSE, a novel unsupervised graph clustering
framework incorporating Deep Structural Entropy. It enhances the original graph
with quantified structural information and deep neural networks to form
clusters. Specifically, we first propose a method for calculating structural
entropy with soft assignment, which quantifies structure in a differentiable
form. Next, we design a Structural Learning layer (SLL) to generate an
attributed graph from the original feature data, serving as a target to enhance
and optimize the original structural graph, thereby mitigating the issue of
sparse connections between graph nodes. Finally, our clustering assignment
method (ASS), based on GNNs, learns node embeddings and a soft assignment
matrix to cluster on the enhanced graph. The ASS layer can be stacked to meet
downstream task requirements, minimizing structural entropy for stable
clustering and maximizing node consistency with edge-based cross-entropy loss.
Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets
against eight representative unsupervised graph clustering baselines,
demonstrating the superiority of the DeSE in both effectiveness and
interpretability.

Motivation: 对抗训练虽有效但计算成本高，研究旨在探索对抗性预训练Transformer的潜力，以降低下游任务的计算负担。

Method: 通过理论分析，证明对抗性预训练的Transformer可通过上下文学习实现多任务鲁棒泛化，无需参数更新。

Result: 模型能专注于鲁棒特征并抵抗攻击，但存在局限性，如某些条件下无法实现普遍鲁棒性，且需大量上下文示例。

Conclusion: 对抗性预训练的Transformer在多任务中展现鲁棒性，但需权衡准确性与鲁棒性，并依赖大量上下文数据。

Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but
it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers
adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models
and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks.
Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a
single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple
unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter
updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and
its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these
positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain
conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer
transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an
accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context
demonstrations. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统GCD方法在减少簇内差异时牺牲了流形容量，限制了类内表示的丰富性。

Result: 实验表明MTMC在聚类精度和类别数量估计上优于现有方法，提升了类间可分性。

Conclusion: MTMC是提升开放世界学习鲁棒性的重要方法。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is essential for improving deep learning
models' robustness in open-world scenarios by clustering unlabeled data
containing both known and novel categories. Traditional GCD methods focus on
minimizing intra-cluster variations, often sacrificing manifold capacity, which
limits the richness of intra-class representations. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach, Maximum Token Manifold Capacity (MTMC), that prioritizes
maximizing the manifold capacity of class tokens to preserve the diversity and
complexity of data. MTMC leverages the nuclear norm of singular values as a
measure of manifold capacity, ensuring that the representation of samples
remains informative and well-structured. This method enhances the
discriminability of clusters, allowing the model to capture detailed semantic
features and avoid the loss of critical information during clustering. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on coarse- and fine-grained
datasets, we demonstrate that MTMC outperforms existing GCD methods, improving
both clustering accuracy and the estimation of category numbers. The
integration of MTMC leads to more complete representations, better inter-class
separability, and a reduction in dimensional collapse, establishing MTMC as a
vital component for robust open-world learning. Code is in

Result: 文本引导显著提升了MLLMs的准确性，均值漂移在空间关系任务上提升7.3%，计数任务提升3.3%。

Conclusion: 文本引导向量是一种高效且低成本的机制，可增强MLLMs的准确性。

Abstract: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding
large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the
same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural
diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered
using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived
steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM
architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial
relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to
+3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors
as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with
minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper pioneers a novel data-centric paradigm to maximize the utility of

begin by identifying three key limitations in existing model-centric

locked to model parameters, hindering its reusability and scalability. To this
end, we propose CoOpt, a highly efficient, parallelized framework for
collaborative unlabeled data optimization, thereby effectively encoding
knowledge into the data itself. By distributing unlabeled data and leveraging
publicly available task-agnostic models, CoOpt facilitates scalable, reusable,
and sustainable training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and architectures demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency, achieving
13.6% and 6.8% improvements on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, respectively,
with training speedups of $1.94 \times $ and $1.2 \times$.

Conclusion: 研究通过高分辨率易感性地图识别高风险区域（如Zagros中部、Hyrcanian森林东北部），强调需制定有效火灾管理策略。

Abstract: This study investigates the multifaceted factors influencing wildfire risk in
Iran, focusing on the interplay between climatic conditions and human
activities. Utilizing advanced remote sensing, geospatial information system
(GIS) processing techniques such as cloud computing, and machine learning
algorithms, this research analyzed the impact of climatic parameters,
topographic features, and human-related factors on wildfire susceptibility
assessment and prediction in Iran. Multiple scenarios were developed for this
purpose based on the data sampling strategy. The findings revealed that
climatic elements such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
significantly contribute to wildfire susceptibility, while human
activities-particularly population density and proximity to powerlines-also
played a crucial role. Furthermore, the seasonal impact of each parameter was
separately assessed during warm and cold seasons. The results indicated that
human-related factors, rather than climatic variables, had a more prominent
influence during the seasonal analyses. This research provided new insights
into wildfire dynamics in Iran by generating high-resolution wildfire
susceptibility maps using advanced machine learning classifiers. The generated
maps identified high risk areas, particularly in the central Zagros region, the
northeastern Hyrcanian Forest, and the northern Arasbaran forest, highlighting
the urgent need for effective fire management strategies.

Result: 实验显示TMCL在类增量学习和迁移学习中优于现有无监督和监督方法，仅需1%标记数据。

Conclusion: 研究表明自上而下调制在平衡稳定性和可塑性中起关键作用。

Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while
integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without
compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods
are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as
supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We
introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration
from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding
principles to integrate top-down information continually and without
supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant
representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive
loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine
modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all
others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance
learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated
representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces
modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past
modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both
class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised
approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as
1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down
modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the
field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies
between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root
causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted
instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph
structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system
driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of
the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated
into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value
of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation
probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of
structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets
and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its
effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners'
learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans,
enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus
promoting the sustainable development of education.

Result: SLAM在模拟和真实空间转录组数据中表现优于其他评估指标，能更全面准确地反映标记质量。

Conclusion: SLAM为空间标记相似性测量提供了全面且准确的解决方案，适用于科学研究和实践应用。

Abstract: Spatial labeling assigns labels to specific spatial locations to characterize
their spatial properties and relationships, with broad applications in
scientific research and practice. Measuring the similarity between two spatial
labelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing
factors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An
adequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should
consider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of
spatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels.
However, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To
address this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the
development of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial
labelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location
organization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The
distributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an
efficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the
dissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete
implementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric
(SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating
spatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \textit{as per} their
similarity with ground truth labeling. Through a series of carefully designed
experimental cases involving both simulated and real ST data, we demonstrate
that SLAM provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of labeling quality
compared to other well-established evaluation metrics. Our code is available at

Result: TTMM性能随专家数量增加而提升，接近TTT，且速度快100倍。

Conclusion: TTMM是扩展测试时训练的高效低成本方法。

Abstract: Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model
capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many
state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use
only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose
Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of
magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time
overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT),
which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT
has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is
computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more
experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B
parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by
amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising
cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.

Conclusion: 能量引导流匹配是一种有效的训练方法，适用于需要多模态动作分布的任务。

Abstract: The use of guidance to steer sampling toward desired outcomes has been widely
explored within diffusion models, especially in applications such as image and
trajectory generation. However, incorporating guidance during training remains
relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce energy-guided flow
matching, a novel approach that enhances the training of flow models and
eliminates the need for guidance at inference time. We learn a conditional
velocity field corresponding to the flow policy by approximating an
energy-guided probability path as a Gaussian path. Learning guided trajectories
is appealing for tasks where the target distribution is defined by a
combination of data and an energy function, as in reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-based policies have recently attracted attention for their expressive
power and ability to capture multi-modal action distributions. Typically, these
policies are optimized using weighted objectives or by back-propagating
gradients through actions sampled by the policy. As an alternative, we propose
FlowQ, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on energy-guided flow
matching. Our method achieves competitive performance while the policy training
time is constant in the number of flow sampling steps.

Conclusion: FedWBA通过非参数和几何聚合方法显著提升了PBFL的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client
data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian
inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive
parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter
averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA,
a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation.
At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for
nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce
particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more
geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global
convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease
lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we
show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the
client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA
outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and
convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.

Conclusion: GraNT证明了教学图属性学习器与结构感知非参数学习器的一致性，提升了学习效率。

Abstract: Inferring properties of graph-structured data, e.g., the solubility of
molecules, essentially involves learning the implicit mapping from graphs to
their properties. This learning process is often costly for graph property
learners like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). To address this, we propose
a paradigm called Graph Neural Teaching (GraNT) that reinterprets the learning
process through a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the
latter offers a theoretical framework for teaching implicitly defined (i.e.,
nonparametric) mappings via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is
realized by a dense set of graph-property pairs, with the GraNT teacher
selecting a subset of them to promote faster convergence in GCN training. By
analytically examining the impact of graph structure on parameter-based
gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of GCNs--shaped
by parameter updates--through functional gradient descent in nonparametric
teaching, we show for the first time that teaching graph property learners
(i.e., GCNs) is consistent with teaching structure-aware nonparametric
learners. These new findings readily commit GraNT to enhancing learning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨安全性对齐是否集中在特定几何子空间，以验证子空间防御策略的有效性。

Method: 通过参数和激活空间的实验，分析安全性行为是否集中在特定子空间，并评估其与通用学习的分离性。

Result: 安全与不安全行为共享相同的子空间和表征，未发现选择性控制安全性的子空间。

Conclusion: 安全性对齐是模型整体学习动态的结果，子空间防御策略可能面临根本性限制，需探索其他策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially
acceptable responses. This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to
be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,
can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work
suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in
weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or
preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether
safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can
be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from
distinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and
activation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe
behaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety
implications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a
subspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the
assumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in
distinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact
components of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that
subspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the
need for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.
We corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rényi度量的生成对抗网络（α-GAN），通过Rényi交叉熵构建价值函数，形成判别器和生成器的博弈问题。α-GAN在α=1时退化为传统GAN，实验表明α∈(0,1)时梯度放大，收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用Rényi度量改进GAN的性能，解决传统GAN中的梯度消失等问题。

Method: 提出α-GAN，基于Rényi交叉熵构建价值函数，形成判别器和生成器的博弈问题，优化参数α。

Result: 实验显示α∈(0,1)时梯度放大，收敛速度加快，可能解决梯度消失问题。

Conclusion: α-GAN在特定α范围内表现优异，但现有研究尚未充分探索这一范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes $\alpha$-GAN, a generative adversarial network using
R\'{e}nyi measures. The value function is formulated, by R\'{e}nyi cross
entropy, as an expected certainty measure incurred by the discriminator's soft
decision as to where the sample is from, true population or the generator. The
discriminator tries to maximize the R\'{e}nyi certainty about sample source,
while the generator wants to reduce it by injecting fake samples. This forms a
min-max problem with the solution parameterized by the R\'{e}nyi order
$\alpha$. This $\alpha$-GAN reduces to vanilla GAN at $\alpha = 1$, where the
value function is exactly the binary cross entropy. The optimization of
$\alpha$-GAN is over probability (vector) space. It is shown that the gradient
is exponentially enlarged when R\'{e}nyi order is in the range $\alpha \in
(0,1)$. This makes convergence faster, which is verified by experimental
results. A discussion shows that choosing $\alpha \in (0,1)$ may be able to
solve some common problems, e.g., vanishing gradient. A following observation
reveals that this range has not been fully explored in the existing R\'{e}nyi
version GANs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer注意力机制中的softmax计算效率低，限制了性能。FlashAttention虽优化了GPU计算，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出FLASH-D，通过数学等价简化公式，隐藏softmax除法，优化指数计算稳定性，并减少计算成本。

Result: 在28nm硬件实现中，面积减少22.8%，功耗降低20.3%，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: FLASH-D在保持FlashAttention优点的同时，进一步提升了计算效率和硬件性能。

Abstract: The transformer's attention mechanism has revolutionized AI and machine
learning, with its efficient computation being crucial to its performance.
However, calculating attention involves matrix operations interspersed with
softmax rescaling, which inherently slows down computation and requires
processing the entire input sequence. Building on online softmax computation,
FlashAttention integrates softmax calculation with matrix arithmetic, enabling
tiled computation independent of sequence length. While optimized for GPUs,
FlashAttention's simplicity makes it amenable to direct hardware acceleration.
This work re-evaluates the core FlashAttention kernel, presenting FLASH-D a
mathematically equivalent, yet simplified, formulation that achieves: (a)
hiding softmax division within other non-linear function evaluations; (b)
inherently numerically stable computation of exponentials, eliminating the need
for maximum value subtraction; and (c) a reduction in computational cost
without introducing numerical approximations to the FlashAttention kernel.
Importantly, the essential FlashAttention properties that facilitate efficient
tiled implementation are fully preserved. Hardware implementation results at
28nm demonstrate that this proposed formulation achieves a 22.8% reduction in
area and a 20.3% reduction in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art
parallel hardware architectures without any performance penalty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DTM方法在建模复杂时间序列时无法捕捉多尺度时间模式，且缺乏理论指导。

Method: 提出MSDformer，采用多尺度时间序列分词器学习多尺度离散令牌表示，并结合多尺度自回归令牌建模技术。

Result: 实验表明MSDformer显著优于现有方法，理论分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 多尺度信息和模式建模能显著提升DTM方法生成时间序列的质量。

Abstract: Discrete Token Modeling (DTM), which employs vector quantization techniques,
has demonstrated remarkable success in modeling non-natural language
modalities, particularly in time series generation. While our prior work
SDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM
approaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns
inherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical
foundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we
proposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called
Multi-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale
time series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple
scales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data.
Subsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling
technique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the
discrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM
method and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale
patterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in
DTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 论文指出了未来研究方向，以提升合成时间序列生成的质量和生成模型在mHealth中的适用性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile sensors has the potential to provide
massive and heterogeneous time series data, driving Artificial Intelligence
applications in mHealth. However, data collection remains limited due to
stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints,
hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly
through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a
promising solution to address both data scarcity and privacy issues. Yet, these
models are often limited to short-term, unimodal signal patterns. This paper
presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time
series synthesis, with a focus on their ability to jointly handle
multi-modality, long-range dependencies, and conditional generation-key
challenges in the mHealth domain. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce a
novel evaluation framework designed to measure both the intrinsic quality of
synthetic data and its utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings
reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in
maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and
ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data
augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to
enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of
generative models in mHealth.

Motivation: 动态网络中的链接预测需要捕捉时空模式和权重动态，传统静态方法无法满足，而张量方法虽能建模多维交互，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用PID控制的张量轮分解（PTWD）模型，结合TWD的拓扑结构和PID控制优化参数学习。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，PTWD模型比其他模型具有更准确的链接预测能力。

Conclusion: PTWD模型通过结合TWD和PID控制，显著提升了动态网络链接预测的性能。

Abstract: Link prediction in dynamic networks remains a fundamental challenge in
network science, requiring the inference of potential interactions and their
evolving strengths through spatiotemporal pattern analysis. Traditional static
network methods have inherent limitations in capturing temporal dependencies
and weight dynamics, while tensor-based methods offer a promising paradigm by
encoding dynamic networks into high-order tensors to explicitly model
multidimensional interactions across nodes and time. Among them, tensor wheel
decomposition (TWD) stands out for its innovative topological structure, which
decomposes high-order tensors into cyclic factors and core tensors to maintain
structural integrity. To improve the prediction accuracy, this study introduces
a PID-controlled tensor wheel decomposition (PTWD) model, which mainly adopts
the following two ideas: 1) exploiting the representation power of TWD to
capture the latent features of dynamic network topology and weight evolution,
and 2) integrating the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle
into the optimization process to obtain a stable model parameter learning
scheme. The performance on four real datasets verifies that the proposed PTWD
model has more accurate link prediction capabilities compared to other models.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher
moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and
polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The
dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have
previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent
assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal
under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic
robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our
derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued
random variables.

Abstract: This study explores the use of Federated Learning (FL) for tuberculosis (TB)
diagnosis using chest X-rays in low-resource settings across Africa. FL allows
hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data,
addressing privacy concerns and data scarcity that hinder traditional
centralized models. The research involved hospitals and research centers in
eight African countries. Most sites used local datasets, while Ghana and The
Gambia used public ones. The study compared locally trained models with a
federated model built across all institutions to evaluate FL's real-world
feasibility. Despite its promise, implementing FL in sub-Saharan Africa faces
challenges such as poor infrastructure, unreliable internet, limited digital
literacy, and weak AI regulations. Some institutions were also reluctant to
share model updates due to data control concerns. In conclusion, FL shows
strong potential for enabling AI-driven healthcare in underserved regions, but
broader adoption will require improvements in infrastructure, education, and
regulatory support.

Conclusion: FEA通过减少计算操作、低误差和非奇异梯度，显著提升了机器学习的效率和模型质量。

Abstract: Shannon entropy (SE) and its quantum mechanical analogue von Neumann entropy
are key components in many tools used in physics, information theory, machine
learning (ML) and quantum computing. Besides of the significant amounts of SE
computations required in these fields, the singularity of the SE gradient is
one of the central mathematical reason inducing the high cost, frequently low
robustness and slow convergence of such tools. Here we propose the Fast Entropy
Approximation (FEA) - a non-singular rational approximation of Shannon entropy
and its gradient that achieves a mean absolute error of $10^{-3}$, which is
approximately $20$ times lower than comparable state-of-the-art methods. FEA
allows around $50\%$ faster computation, requiring only $5$ to $6$ elementary
computational operations, as compared to tens of elementary operations behind
the fastest entropy computation algorithms with table look-ups, bitshifts, or
series approximations. On a set of common benchmarks for the feature selection
problem in machine learning, we show that the combined effect of fewer
elementary operations, low approximation error, and a non-singular gradient
allows significantly better model quality and enables ML feature extraction
that is two to three orders of magnitude faster and computationally cheaper
when incorporating FEA into AI tools.

Abstract: Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has
recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing
approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when
relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations
research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of
neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively
generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this
paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such
inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated
annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific
neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal
distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible
solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and
associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly
reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We
demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with
time windows.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private second moment estimation and
present a new algorithm that achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs even for
worst-case inputs under subsamplability assumptions on the data. We call an
input $(m,\alpha,\beta)$-subsamplable if a random subsample of size $m$ (or
larger) preserves w.p $\geq 1-\beta$ the spectral structure of the original
second moment matrix up to a multiplicative factor of $1\pm \alpha$. Building
upon subsamplability, we give a recursive algorithmic framework similar to
Kamath et al 2019, that abides zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP)
while preserving w.h.p. the accuracy of the second moment estimation upto an
arbitrary factor of $(1\pm\gamma)$. We then show how to apply our algorithm to
approximate the second moment matrix of a distribution $\mathcal{D}$, even when
a noticeable fraction of the input are outliers.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online
Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a
model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with
variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the
combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for
performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and
sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs.
However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary
and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes
occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or
Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and
initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN,
enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply
this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE
system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its
ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D
Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric
sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure
data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize
physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we
address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass
fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

Conclusion: AAPO有效提升了训练效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to
limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods,
group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the
dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to
traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we
observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers
from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage
approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented
Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the
cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based
estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies
associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on
multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance
of AAPO.

Conclusion: X-KAN验证了KAN作为局部模型在XCSF中的有效性，结合了精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Function approximation is a critical task in various fields. However,
existing neural network approaches struggle with locally complex or
discontinuous functions due to their reliance on a single global model covering
the entire problem space. We propose X-KAN, a novel method that optimizes
multiple local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) through an evolutionary
rule-based machine learning framework called XCSF. X-KAN combines KAN's high
expressiveness with XCSF's adaptive partitioning capability by implementing
local KAN models as rule consequents and defining local regions via rule
antecedents. Our experimental results on artificial test functions and
real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms
conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms
of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with
locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for
conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules).
These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF,
which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our
X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的量化感知训练（QAT）缩放定律，通过268次实验揭示了量化误差与模型大小、训练数据量和量化粒度的关系，并指出激活量化误差是W4A4 QAT的主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高资源需求限制了其部署，量化感知训练（QAT）虽能降低模型精度但保持性能，但其在4位精度（W4A4）下的缩放行为尚不明确。

Method: 通过268次QAT实验，提出统一的缩放定律，量化误差分解为权重和激活分量，并分析其敏感性。

Result: 量化误差随模型增大而减小，随训练数据增多和量化粒度变粗而增加；激活量化误差（尤其是FC2层）是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 混合精度量化可解决激活量化误差瓶颈，权重量化误差在数据增多时更为显著，为QAT研发提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory
resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)
addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining
performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit
precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often
ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization
granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified
scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,
training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,
we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises
with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the
sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation
components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization
error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization
error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows
that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is
the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying
mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that
weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.
Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually
exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight
quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MultiTab是一个用于多维、数据感知分析的表格学习算法基准套件和评估框架，通过分类196个数据集并评估13种模型，揭示了模型性能对数据特征的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准通常依赖平均指标，无法揭示模型在不同数据机制下的行为差异，MultiTab旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MultiTab根据样本量、标签不平衡和特征交互等关键特征分类数据集，并评估13种代表性模型。

Result: 模型性能高度依赖数据特征，例如基于样本相似性的模型在大样本或高特征相关性数据上表现更好。

Conclusion: MultiTab揭示了归纳偏置并非总是如预期，数据感知评估对理解模型行为至关重要，为模型设计和选择提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of tabular data in real-world applications, most
benchmarks rely on average-case metrics, which fail to reveal how model
behavior varies across diverse data regimes. To address this, we propose
MultiTab, a benchmark suite and evaluation framework for multi-dimensional,
data-aware analysis of tabular learning algorithms. Rather than comparing
models only in aggregate, MultiTab categorizes 196 publicly available datasets
along key data characteristics, including sample size, label imbalance, and
feature interaction, and evaluates 13 representative models spanning a range of
inductive biases. Our analysis shows that model performance is highly sensitive
to such regimes: for example, models using sample-level similarity excel on
datasets with large sample sizes or high inter-feature correlation, while
models encoding inter-feature dependencies perform best with weakly correlated
features. These findings reveal that inductive biases do not always behave as
intended, and that regime-aware evaluation is essential for understanding and
improving model behavior. MultiTab enables more principled model design and
offers practical guidance for selecting models tailored to specific data
characteristics. All datasets, code, and optimization logs are publicly
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LGAI-DILab/Multitab.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on
their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1)
\rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear
(CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella
(NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there
are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require
this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that
$\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL
functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers
can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we
show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute
the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the
$\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in
the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The
constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of
the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

Motivation: 解决有限标记数据和噪声/不平衡数据集的挑战，提升分类性能。

Method: 采用距离加权机制，结合不确定性一致性和基于图的表示技术。

Result: 在12个基准数据集上显著提升准确率、精确率和召回率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为半监督学习提供了实用解决方案，适用于医疗和安全等领域。

Abstract: Recent advancements in semi-supervised deep learning have introduced
effective strategies for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve
classification performance. This work proposes a semi-supervised framework that
utilizes a distance-based weighting mechanism to prioritize critical training
samples based on their proximity to test data. By focusing on the most
informative examples, the method enhances model generalization and robustness,
particularly in challenging scenarios with noisy or imbalanced datasets.
Building on techniques such as uncertainty consistency and graph-based
representations, the approach addresses key challenges of limited labeled data
while maintaining scalability. Experiments on twelve benchmark datasets
demonstrate significant improvements across key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, and recall, consistently outperforming existing methods. This
framework provides a robust and practical solution for semi-supervised
learning, with potential applications in domains such as healthcare and
security where data limitations pose significant challenges.

TL;DR: 研究探索了如何从语言模型中提取隐藏知识，通过训练一个Taboo模型（描述秘密词但不直接提及），并评估黑盒和解释性方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型变得更强大，确保其可信赖和可靠至关重要。初步证据表明模型可能试图欺骗或对操作者保密，因此需要探索提取隐藏知识的方法。

Method: 训练一个Taboo模型，秘密词不在训练数据或提示中出现。使用黑盒方法和解释性技术（如logit lens和稀疏自编码器）提取秘密词。

Result: 两种方法在概念验证中均有效提取了秘密词。

Conclusion: 研究为提取语言模型中的隐藏知识提供了初步方法，未来可进一步优化并应用于更复杂的模型。

Abstract: As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that
they remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence
that models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To
explore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we
train a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word
without explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to
the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to
uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box)
approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on
mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse
autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting
the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting. Our findings highlight the
promise of these approaches for eliciting hidden knowledge and suggest several
promising avenues for future work, including testing and refining these methods
on more complex model organisms. This work aims to be a step towards addressing
the crucial problem of eliciting secret knowledge from language models, thereby
contributing to their safe and reliable deployment.

Method: 开发逐层量化框架，结合分布式变分不等式，提出QODA算法，采用自适应学习率。

Result: QODA在12+ GPU上训练Wasserstein GAN时，比基线方法提速150%。

Conclusion: QODA通过逐层量化和自适应学习率，有效解决了异构网络的训练效率问题。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit heterogeneity across numerous layers of
various types such as residuals, multi-head attention, etc., due to varying
structures (dimensions, activation functions, etc.), distinct representation
characteristics, which impact predictions. We develop a general layer-wise
quantization framework with tight variance and code-length bounds, adapting to
the heterogeneities over the course of training. We then apply a new layer-wise
quantization technique within distributed variational inequalities (VIs),
proposing a novel Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging (QODA) algorithm with
adaptive learning rates, which achieves competitive convergence rates for
monotone VIs. We empirically show that QODA achieves up to a $150\%$ speedup
over the baselines in end-to-end training time for training Wasserstein GAN on
$12+$ GPUs.

TL;DR: 算法工具在招聘中用于提高公平性和多样性，但研究发现强制短名单性别平衡并不一定能增加最终多样性，尤其是当算法筛选标准与招聘经理偏好高度相关时。提出了一种新方法，通过选择可能被忽视但仍具竞争力的候选人来显著提升多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨算法工具在招聘中强制性别平衡短名单是否能真正提高最终多样性，并分析影响这一结果的关键因素。

Method: 通过理论分析和近80万份技术公司工作申请的大规模实证研究，检验算法筛选标准与招聘经理偏好的相关性对多样性的影响，并提出一种新的算法方法。

Result: 研究发现，当算法筛选与招聘经理偏好高度相关时，强制性别平衡短名单对最终多样性改善有限。新提出的方法能显著提升性别多样性且不影响招聘质量。

Conclusion: 算法设计选择对实现组织多样性目标至关重要，研究为实践者提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and
diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate
shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal
representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more
diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We
identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the
algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation
criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a
large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across
multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields
limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely
mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary
algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting
candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according
to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach
significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially
compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of
algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and
provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented
hiring algorithms.

Result: 在自然驾驶数据测试中，监控器提升了安全性，同时保持了任务可用性。

Conclusion: 该监控器通过可解释性增强了ML系统的安全保证，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Autonomous systems that rely on Machine Learning (ML) utilize online fault
tolerance mechanisms, such as runtime monitors, to detect ML prediction errors
and maintain safety during operation. However, the lack of human-interpretable
explanations for these errors can hinder the creation of strong assurances
about the system's safety and reliability. This paper introduces a novel
fuzzy-based monitor tailored for ML perception components. It provides
human-interpretable explanations about how different operating conditions
affect the reliability of perception components and also functions as a runtime
safety monitor. We evaluated our proposed monitor using naturalistic driving
datasets as part of an automated driving case study. The interpretability of
the monitor was evaluated and we identified a set of operating conditions in
which the perception component performs reliably. Additionally, we created an
assurance case that links unit-level evidence of \textit{correct} ML operation
to system-level \textit{safety}. The benchmarking demonstrated that our monitor
achieved a better increase in safety (i.e., absence of hazardous situations)
while maintaining availability (i.e., ability to perform the mission) compared
to state-of-the-art runtime ML monitors in the evaluated dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序分词方法固定样本数为标记，导致简单模式生成过多标记，计算开销大。

Method: 基于频繁模式的离散词汇表，合并样本与模式为标记，并引入无需梯度计算的轻量级条件解码优化。

Result: 在时序基础模型上，预测性能提升36%，效率提升1990%；条件解码进一步降低MSE达44%。

Conclusion: 该方法自适应多样时序模式，泛化性强，标记表示能捕捉统计矩和趋势等时序特性。

Abstract: Existing time series tokenization methods predominantly encode a constant
number of samples into individual tokens. This inflexible approach can generate
excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values,
resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of
byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme
for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs,
our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing
time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous
properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a
lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no
gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series
foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting
performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional
decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we
demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns,
its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations
capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and
trends.

Result: TARTE生成的表示可微调或与其他学习器结合，显著提升预测性能并优化计算效率。

Conclusion: TARTE为表格学习提供了一种有效的知识预训练方法，展示了其在领域特定表示和性能提升上的潜力。

Abstract: Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on
tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream
tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical
entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural
networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently
boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world
knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular
foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring
benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or
combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model
that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the
string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields
representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional
cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners,
giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve
the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a
domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further
learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge
pre-training for tabular learning.

Result: 方法在哲学基础、普适性、可扩展性、忠实性、正确性、可训练性和实用性等方面均表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经网络解释性提供了一种新思路，兼具理论深度和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a new interpretability method for neural networks, which is based
on a novel mathematico-philosophical theory of reasons. Our method computes a
vector for each neuron, called its reasons vector. We then can compute how
strongly this reasons vector speaks for various propositions, e.g., the
proposition that the input image depicts digit 2 or that the input prompt has a
negative sentiment. This yields an interpretation of neurons, and groups
thereof, that combines a logical and a Bayesian perspective, and accounts for
polysemanticity (i.e., that a single neuron can figure in multiple concepts).
We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this method is: (1) grounded
in a philosophically established notion of explanation, (2) uniform, i.e.,
applies to the common neural network architectures and modalities, (3)
scalable, since computing reason vectors only involves forward-passes in the
neural network, (4) faithful, i.e., intervening on a neuron based on its reason
vector leads to expected changes in model output, (5) correct in that the
model's reasons structure matches that of the data source, (6) trainable, i.e.,
neural networks can be trained to improve their reason strengths, (7) useful,
i.e., it delivers on the needs for interpretability by increasing, e.g.,
robustness and fairness.

Result: 结合DL的预测能力与SD的可解释性，实现因果可靠性和扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过实际应用验证框架有效性，目标是支持自主系统的可解释性与安全性。

Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to bridge the gap between Deep Learning
(DL) and System Dynamics (SD) by developing an interpretable neural system
dynamics framework. While DL excels at learning complex models and making
accurate predictions, it lacks interpretability and causal reliability.
Traditional SD approaches, on the other hand, provide transparency and causal
insights but are limited in scalability and require extensive domain knowledge.
To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Neural System Dynamics
pipeline, integrating Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic
Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. This framework combines the
predictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models,
resulting in both causal reliability and scalability. The efficacy of the
proposed pipeline will be validated through real-world applications of the
EU-funded AutoMoTIF project, which is focused on autonomous multimodal
transportation systems. The long-term goal is to collect actionable insights
that support the integration of explainability and safety in autonomous
systems.

Conclusion: RefiDiff是一种高效、稳定的缺失值填补方法，特别适用于复杂缺失模式的高维混合类型数据。

Abstract: Missing values in high-dimensional, mixed-type datasets pose significant
challenges for data imputation, particularly under Missing Not At Random (MNAR)
mechanisms. Existing methods struggle to integrate local and global data
characteristics, limiting performance in MNAR and high-dimensional settings. We
propose an innovative framework, RefiDiff, combining local machine learning
predictions with a novel Mamba-based denoising network capturing
interrelationships among distant features and samples. Our approach leverages
pre-refinement for initial warm-up imputations and post-refinement to polish
results, enhancing stability and accuracy. By encoding mixed-type data into
unified tokens, RefiDiff enables robust imputation without architectural or
hyperparameter tuning. RefiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
across missing-value settings, excelling in MNAR with a 4x faster training time
than SOTA DDPM-based approaches. Extensive evaluations on nine real-world
datasets demonstrate its robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in handling
complex missingness patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to network control

Abstract: Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To
date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph
adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph
neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there
exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how
to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle
the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the
process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic
system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a
generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial
resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to
capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint
the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system.
Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five
commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.

Motivation: 当前无服务器计算在服务LoRA推理时存在参数冗余、加载延迟高和资源竞争等问题，导致GPU浪费、TTFT增加和高成本。

Result: 实验表明，ServerlessLoRA将TTFT降低86%，成本减少89%。

Conclusion: ServerlessLoRA显著提升了LoRA LLM推理的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM)
inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid
scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively
serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to
three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where
99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency
beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple
LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased
Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs.
  We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for
faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM
sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a
pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize
cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware
batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty
workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA
reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to
state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in insulin preparations and technology, adjusting
insulin remains an ongoing challenge for the majority of people with type 1
diabetes (T1D) and longstanding type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we
propose the Adaptive Basal-Bolus Advisor (ABBA), a personalised insulin
treatment recommendation approach based on reinforcement learning for
individuals with T1D and T2D, performing self-monitoring blood glucose
measurements and multiple daily insulin injection therapy. We developed and
evaluated the ability of ABBA to achieve better time-in-range (TIR) for
individuals with T1D and T2D, compared to a standard basal-bolus advisor (BBA).
The in-silico test was performed using an FDA-accepted population, including
101 simulated adults with T1D and 101 with T2D. An in-silico evaluation shows
that ABBA significantly improved TIR and significantly reduced both times
below- and above-range, compared to BBA. ABBA's performance continued to
improve over two months, whereas BBA exhibited only modest changes. This
personalised method for adjusting insulin has the potential to further optimise
glycaemic control and support people with T1D and T2D in their daily
self-management. Our results warrant ABBA to be trialed for the first time in

### [421] [Learning to Integrate Diffusion ODEs by Averaging the Derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14502)
*Wenze Liu,Xiangyu Yue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种平衡性能与成本的中间策略，通过基于导数-积分关系的损失函数学习ODE积分，快速将预训练扩散模型转换为secant版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值求解器在极小步长下性能不佳，而蒸馏技术常引入复杂性和不稳定性，需一种折中方案。

Method: 利用蒙特卡洛积分和Picard迭代的灵感，设计secant损失函数，逐步将切线延伸为割线。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EDM的secant版本实现10步FID为2.14；在ImageNet-256×256上，SiT-XL/2的secant版本4步FID为2.27，8步FID为1.96。

Conclusion: secant损失函数能高效优化扩散模型推理，平衡性能与成本。

Abstract: To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at
extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity
and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing
performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived
from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration
and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by
gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses.
The secant losses can rapidly convert (via fine-tuning or distillation) a
pretrained diffusion model into its secant version. In our experiments, the
secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the
secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID
of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$. Code will be available.

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络在训练分布外推时的行为，发现加入Layer Norm（LN）可以显著改善输出的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络在远离训练数据时的行为，并探索如何通过结构改进（如LN）增强其外推能力。

Method: 应用Neural Tangent Kernel（NTK）理论分析无限宽神经网络，并通过实验验证有限宽度网络的表现。

Result: 加入LN的神经网络输出在远离训练数据时保持有界，而未加LN的网络可能产生极端输出。

Conclusion: LN层能有效提升神经网络的外推稳定性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when
extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood,
with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general
results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and
prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the
induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the
output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even
on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class
of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain
inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on
finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit
uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively
mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this
extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in
proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial
images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.

TL;DR: Latent Flow Transformer (LFT) 通过流匹配训练替代离散层块，显著压缩模型并保持性能。Flow Walking (FW) 算法进一步提升了耦合保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer层数多效率低，连续层在图像生成中表现优越，但流方法在语言模型中耦合保持不足。

Method: 提出LFT，用流匹配训练的传输算子替代层块；引入FW算法改进耦合保持。

Result: 在Pythia-410M上，LFT压缩6层性能优于跳过2层；FW进一步压缩12层且KL散度更低。

Conclusion: LFT结合FW显著缩小自回归与流生成范式差距，验证了设计的可行性。

Abstract: Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs),
typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can
lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from
efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated
by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent
Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned
transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression
while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally,
we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving
coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M
model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms
directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529),
demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further
distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from
skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between
autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.

Result: 实验显示性能显著优于传统方法，模型决策透明。

Conclusion: 框架兼具预测效果和实用价值，支持应急准备和社区韧性提升。

Abstract: Wind hazards such as tornadoes and straight-line winds frequently affect
vulnerable communities in the Great Plains of the United States, where limited
infrastructure and sparse data coverage hinder effective emergency response.
Existing forecasting systems focus primarily on meteorological elements and
often fail to capture community-specific vulnerabilities, limiting their
utility for localized risk assessment and resilience planning. To address this
gap, we propose an interpretable dual-stream learning framework that integrates
structured numerical weather data with unstructured textual event narratives.
Our architecture combines a Random Forest and RoBERTa-based transformer through
a late fusion mechanism, enabling robust and context-aware wind hazard
prediction. The system is tailored for underserved tribal communities and
supports block-level risk assessment. Experimental results show significant
performance gains over traditional baselines. Furthermore, gradient-based
sensitivity and ablation studies provide insight into the model's
decision-making process, enhancing transparency and operational trust. The
findings demonstrate both predictive effectiveness and practical value in
supporting emergency preparedness and advancing community resilience.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food
data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite
several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there
has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We
introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide
personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated
micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts
entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as
context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system
generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To
evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe
related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly
outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for
food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and
benchmark datasets are publicly available at

Conclusion: SifterNet是一种高效、通用的触发器净化方法，适用于各种模型，具有显著优越性能。

Abstract: Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and
vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and
model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising
model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to
know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large
number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings
the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to
target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger
without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight
and black-box defense approach SifterNet is proposed through leveraging the
memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the
triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The
main novelty of our proposed approach lies in the introduction of ideology of
Ising model. Extensive experiments also validate the effectiveness of our
approach in terms of proper trigger purification and high accuracy achievement,
and compared to the state-of-the-art baselines under several commonly-used
datasets, our SiferNet has a significant superior performance.

Result: 实验表明，STRL在基准测试中优于传统Transformer，兼具高效能和策略优化。

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂决策任务中部署低成本、生物启发的机器学习模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement
learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks.
However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in
significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world
autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically
inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning.
In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL)
algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful
decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed.
Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over
multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with
state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure
optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments
conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN
Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to
conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and
policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying
bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world
decision-making scenarios.

Motivation: 多模态脉冲神经网络在能量效率方面具有潜力，但面临模态不平衡和时间错位问题，现有方法无法动态协调跨模态交互。

Method: 1) 提出TAAF模块，动态分配重要性分数；2) 设计时间自适应平衡融合损失，基于注意力分数调整学习率。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经形态系统中的多模态学习提供了新范式，弥合了生物感知与高效机器智能之间的差距。

Abstract: Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for
energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality
imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from
uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms
that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal
attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two
synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion
(TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking
features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally
heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion
loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention
scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The
proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal
dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning,
mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D,
AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%,
70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system
resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and
faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work
establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in
neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing
and efficient machine intelligence.

Abstract: Traditional time series models are task-specific and often depend on
dataset-specific training and extensive feature engineering. While
Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models,
commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series
and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a
foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared,
transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique
difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates
architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions
while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a
loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our
$7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse
downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation
learning.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally intensive and
physically incomplete in traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP)
methods. Deep learning (DL) models offer efficiency and accuracy but often
ignore physical laws, limiting interpretability and generalization. We propose
PhyDL-NWP, a physics-guided deep learning framework that integrates physical
equations with latent force parameterization into data-driven models. It
predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes
physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss
to align predictions with governing dynamics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free
downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes
pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference
with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both

Abstract: This paper reviews the topological groundwork for the study of reinforcement

We begin by recalling key mathematical concepts such as complete metric spaces,
which form the foundation for expressing RL problems. By leveraging the Banach
contraction principle, we illustrate how the Banach fixed-point theorem
explains the convergence of RL algorithms and how Bellman operators, expressed
as operators on Banach spaces, ensure this convergence. The work serves as a
bridge between theoretical mathematics and practical algorithm design, offering
new approaches to enhance the efficiency of RL. In particular, we investigate
alternative formulations of Bellman operators and demonstrate their impact on
improving convergence rates and performance in standard RL environments such as

Result: 实验显示KIPPO在连续控制任务中性能提升6-60%，方差降低高达91%。

Conclusion: KIPPO有效结合线性化优势与策略优化，显著提升学习稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in various domains,
and policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have gained
popularity due to their balance in performance, training stability, and
computational efficiency. These methods directly optimize policies through
gradient-based updates. However, developing effective control policies for
environments with complex and non-linear dynamics remains a challenge. High
variance in gradient estimates and non-convex optimization landscapes often
lead to unstable learning trajectories. Koopman Operator Theory has emerged as
a powerful framework for studying non-linear systems through an
infinite-dimensional linear operator that acts on a higher-dimensional space of
measurement functions. In contrast with their non-linear counterparts, linear
systems are simpler, more predictable, and easier to analyze. In this paper, we
present Koopman-Inspired Proximal Policy Optimization (KIPPO), which learns an
approximately linear latent-space representation of the underlying system's
dynamics while retaining essential features for effective policy learning. This
is achieved through a Koopman-approximation auxiliary network that can be added
to the baseline policy optimization algorithms without altering the
architecture of the core policy or value function. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate consistent improvements over the PPO baseline with 6-60%
increased performance while reducing variability by up to 91% when evaluated on
various continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial neural network pruning is a method in which artificial neural
network sizes can be reduced while attempting to preserve the predicting
capabilities of the network. This is done to make the model smaller or faster
during inference time. In this work we analyze the ability of a selection of
artificial neural network pruning methods to generalize to a new cybersecurity
dataset utilizing a simpler network type than was designed for. We analyze each
method using a variety of pruning degrees to best understand how each algorithm
responds to the new environment. This has allowed us to determine the most well
fit pruning method of those we searched for the task. Unexpectedly, we have
found that many of them do not generalize to the problem well, leaving only a
few algorithms working to an acceptable degree.

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential
equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems
by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the
characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics.
Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they
have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned
latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This
mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this
work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating
differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the
latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly
by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong
correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by
accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters,
enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining
continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore,
$\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained
or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a
flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We
demonstrate the framework's robustness across different PDE solvers and
highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX
implementation readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable
solvers.

Abstract: Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data
with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other
critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information,
researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether
poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations,
or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is
"more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we
introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark
for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time
series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to
isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating
between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering
algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive
benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation
structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance
thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of
correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from
downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification;
and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first
clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by
identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal
distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of
methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for
correlation-based time series clustering.

training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this
work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces
Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic
interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise
representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation,
making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a
corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable
Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an
electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This
approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with
insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22
benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust
improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from
4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$-Module achieves
best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a
first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly
improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient
and lightweight in training. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于最大均值差异（MMD）的牛顿方法（MMDN），用于解决连续多目标优化问题（MOPs），并通过与多目标进化算法（MOEA）的混合使用，显著提升了优化精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多目标优化问题中，常用方法是最小化近似Pareto前沿与参考集之间的距离（如Hausdorff距离）。本文提出使用MMD作为距离度量，以更有效地衡量两组之间的差异。

Method: 提出MMDN方法，利用MMD的梯度和Hessian矩阵设计牛顿优化算法，并分析其理论性质。进一步提出将MMDN与MOEA混合使用，先用MOEA初步优化，再用MMDN精细调整。

Result: 在11个基准问题上测试，混合方法（MMDN + MOEA）在相同计算资源下比单独使用MOEA显著提高了优化精度。

Conclusion: MMDN方法在多目标优化中表现出色，与MOEA的混合使用进一步提升了性能，为复杂优化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely employed to measure the
distance between probability distributions. In this paper, we propose using MMD
to solve continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For solving
MOPs, a common approach is to minimize the distance (e.g., Hausdorff) between a
finite approximate set of the Pareto front and a reference set. Viewing these
two sets as empirical measures, we propose using MMD to measure the distance
between them. To minimize the MMD value, we provide the analytical expression
of its gradient and Hessian matrix w.r.t. the search variables, and use them to
devise a novel set-oriented, MMD-based Newton (MMDN) method. Also, we analyze
the theoretical properties of MMD's gradient and Hessian, including the
first-order stationary condition and the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which
are important for verifying the correctness of MMDN. To solve complicated
problems, we propose hybridizing MMDN with multiobjective evolutionary
algorithms (MOEAs), where we first execute an EA for several iterations to get
close to the global Pareto front and then warm-start MMDN with the result of
the MOEA to efficiently refine the approximation. We empirically test the
hybrid algorithm on 11 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show the
hybrid (MMDN + MOEA) can achieve a much better optimization accuracy than EA
alone with the same computation budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种开发虚拟细胞的方法，以模拟细胞对扰动的功能响应，从而加速药物发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现需要可靠的模型模拟患者反应，虚拟细胞能安全经济地测试大量治疗假设，但目前尚未实现。

Method: 结合AI、计算能力、实验室自动化和高通量细胞分析，设计虚拟细胞并采用“实验室闭环”方法生成新见解。

Result: 虚拟细胞需准确预测细胞功能响应并解释其机制，同时提出生物学基准指导开发。

Conclusion: 虚拟细胞框架可扩展到更高层次模型（如虚拟患者），有望推动药物发现。

Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of
treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from
computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling
researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely
and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific
model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of
perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective
treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that
unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of
cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities
for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing
and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We
argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to
perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of
modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key
principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate
for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development.
Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful
framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including
virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research
community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug
discovery outcomes.

TL;DR: 华为云用户使用LoRA（低秩适应）高效微调大语言模型（LLM），但复杂推理任务常受基础模型偏见干扰。本文提出对比LoRA解码（CoLD），通过对比解码优化任务性能，提升准确率5.54%，延迟降低28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA微调模型在复杂任务中受基础模型偏见干扰的问题，提升任务特定知识的利用。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，通过对比LoRA专家模型与基础模型的概率分布差异，优先选择与LoRA学习表示更匹配的token。

Result: CoLD提升任务准确率5.54%，端到端延迟降低28%。

Conclusion: CoLD为资源受限环境提供了高效解码策略，适用于云和本地部署的数据科学应用。

Abstract: Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and
scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for
application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or
deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from
the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.
These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model
instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we
introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed
to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,
resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by
scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability
distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.
This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned
representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,
a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each
decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.
To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD
achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end
latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and
efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained
environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud
and on-premises settings.

Conclusion: 解决验证器假阴性问题对提升强化学习微调效果至关重要，tinyV提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their
policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of
rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze
a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct
model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals
that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where
the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and
theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by
depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To
mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments
existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false
negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward
estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts
pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.
Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false
negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of
LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

Motivation: 研究预测编码（PC）在深度学习中的理论基础，将其与MDL原则结合，以提供比反向传播更生物可信的替代方案。

Method: 通过Hoeffding不等式和前缀码先验，推导泛化边界，证明PC更新单调减少MDL目标，并收敛到块坐标稳定点。

Result: PC能联合最小化经验风险和模型复杂度，提供比梯度下降更紧的风险边界，并收敛到近似MDL最优解。

Conclusion: PC是一种理论可靠且生物合理的深度学习训练方法，首次为其提供了泛化和收敛的理论保证。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding
(PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description
length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs
block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly
minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality
and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form
$R(\theta) \le \hat{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff
between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically
decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability
risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated
PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an
approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result
offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep
models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible
alternative to backpropagation.

Method: 结合结构化临床数据与自然语言处理的自由文本数据，生成高质量数据集，并比较LTM模型与传统评分和机器学习模型。

Result: LTM模型的预测性能最高，且揭示了性别和年龄的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 结构化与自由文本数据结合提升了数据集质量，LTM模型在预测房颤复发中优于传统方法。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is linked
to high morbidity and mortality. In a fast-evolving AF rhythm control treatment
era, predicting AF recurrence after its onset may be crucial to achieve the
optimal therapeutic approach, yet traditional scores like CHADS2-VASc, HATCH,
and APPLE show limited predictive accuracy. Moreover, early diagnosis studies
often rely on codified electronic health record (EHR) data, which may contain
errors and missing information.
  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to predict AF recurrence between one month and two
years after onset by evaluating traditional clinical scores, ML models, and our
LTM approach. Moreover, another objective is to develop a methodology for
integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance tabular dataset
quality.
  METHODS: A tabular dataset was generated by combining structured clinical
data with free-text discharge reports processed through natural language
processing techniques, reducing errors and annotation effort. A total of 1,508
patients with documented AF onset were identified, and models were evaluated on
a manually annotated test set. The proposed approach includes a LTM compared
against traditional clinical scores and ML models.
  RESULTS: The proposed LTM approach achieved the highest predictive
performance, surpassing both traditional clinical scores and ML models.
Additionally, the gender and age bias analyses revealed demographic
disparities.
  CONCLUSION: The integration of structured data and free-text sources resulted
in a high-quality dataset. The findings emphasize the limitations of
traditional clinical scores in predicting AF recurrence and highlight the
potential of ML-based approaches, particularly our LTM model.

integration of Internet of Medical Things devices, such as robotic surgical
tools, intensive care systems, and wearable monitors has enhanced patient care
but introduced serious security risks. Cyberattacks on these devices can lead
to life threatening consequences, including surgical errors, equipment failure,

role in healthcare through AI and cloud integration, it also raises new
security concerns. This paper explores how explainable AI techniques like SHAP,
LIME, and DiCE can uncover vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses, and improve
trust and transparency in 6G enabled healthcare. We support our approach with

Conclusion: Quartet证明了全FP4训练是一种可行的替代方案，为低精度训练提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has been paralleled by
unprecedented increases in computational demands, with training costs for
state-of-the-art models doubling every few months. Training models directly in
low-precision arithmetic offers a solution, by improving both computational
throughput and energy efficiency. Specifically, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell
architecture facilitates extremely low-precision operations, specifically FP4
variants, promising substantial efficiency gains. Yet, current algorithms for
training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often
rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling
accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.
linear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations
on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies
performance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a
"near-optimal" low-precision training technique in terms of
accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized
CUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training
billion-scale models. Our method demonstrates that fully FP4-based training is
a competitive alternative to standard-precision and FP8 training. Our code is

we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to

Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean
space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures.
However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with
fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining
traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships
and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic,
spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more
efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric
properties, including web-related data like social network topology,
query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating
foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance
their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better
performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This
workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and
Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the
potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据爆炸式增长需要高效压缩技术，现有神经压缩方法在高压缩比下难以保持感知质量、计算效率和内容适应性。

Method: 采用基于变压器的自动编码器和增强的BSQ瓶颈，结合频率域注意力和颜色一致性优化的GAN架构。

Result: 压缩效率大幅提升，文件大小减少100倍，PSNR/SSIM与传统编解码器相当，FID降低43%，编码解码速度快2.4倍。

Conclusion: GANCompress在神经压缩技术上取得显著进展，适用于实时视觉通信系统。

Abstract: The exponential growth of visual data in digital communications has
intensified the need for efficient compression techniques that balance
rate-distortion performance with computational feasibility. While recent neural
compression approaches have shown promise, they still struggle with fundamental
challenges: preserving perceptual quality at high compression ratios,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse visual content. This
paper introduces GANCompress, a novel neural compression framework that
synergistically combines Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ) with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address these challenges. Our approach employs a
transformer-based autoencoder with an enhanced BSQ bottleneck that projects
latent representations onto a hypersphere, enabling efficient discretization
with bounded quantization error. This is followed by a specialized GAN
architecture incorporating frequency-domain attention and color consistency
optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCompress achieves
substantial improvement in compression efficiency -- reducing file sizes by up
to 100x with minimal visual distortion. Our method outperforms traditional
codecs like H.264 by 12-15% in perceptual metrics while maintaining comparable
PSNR/SSIM values, with 2.4x faster encoding and decoding speeds. On standard
benchmarks including ImageNet-1k and COCO2017, GANCompress sets a new
state-of-the-art, reducing FID from 0.72 to 0.41 (43% improvement) compared to
previous methods while maintaining higher throughput. This work presents a
significant advancement in neural compression technology with promising
applications for real-time visual communication systems.

Method: 在余弦加权和滤波阶段选择性集成可训练元素，利用小波变换稀疏化参数，减少参数数量93.75%。

Result: 方法在保持FDK计算成本的同时，提高了图像质量、噪声鲁棒性，并加速了收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用中计算受限环境提供了一种实用的改进方案。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the
Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due
to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While
recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase
computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods.
In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains
the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable
elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the
challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage
wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights
and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by
$93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and
importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the
classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and
boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward
integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a
pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in
environments with computational limitations.

Abstract: This paper explores how the image quality assessment (IQA) task affects the
cognitive processes of people from the perspective of pupil size and studies
the relationship between pupil size and image quality. Specifically, we first
invited subjects to participate in a subjective experiment, which includes two
tasks: free observation and IQA. In the free observation task, subjects did not
need to perform any action, and they only needed to observe images as they
usually do with an album. In the IQA task, subjects were required to score
images according to their overall impression of image quality. Then, by
analyzing the difference in pupil size between the two tasks, we find that
people may activate the visual attention mechanism when evaluating image
quality. Meanwhile, we also find that the change in pupil size is closely
related to image quality in the IQA task. For future research on IQA, this
research can not only provide a theoretical basis for the objective IQA method
and promote the development of more effective objective IQA methods, but also
provide a new subjective IQA method for collecting the authentic subjective
impression of image quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估方法主观性强、成本高、耗时长且可靠性低，需要自动化质量评估系统。

Method: 结合TBS诊断标准、AI算法和临床数据特征，通过目标检测、分类和分割模型量化质量指标，并使用XGBoost模型综合评分。

Result: 在100个WSI上的实验表明，该方法在速度和一致性上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为宫颈癌筛查提供了一种高效、可靠的质量评估解决方案。

Abstract: The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical
cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the
diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of
pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high
cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that
performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address
this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical
Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS)
diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the
characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to
quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining
quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including
object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost
model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality
evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive
WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs
demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in
terms of speed and consistency.

Abstract: A common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease requires a precise
diagnosis and efficient treatment, particularly in light of escalating
healthcare expenses and the expanding use of artificial intelligence in medical
diagnostics. Many recent studies shows that the combination of brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and deep neural networks have achieved promising
results for diagnosing AD. Using deep convolutional neural networks, this paper
introduces a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates multiresidual
blocks, specialized spatial attention blocks, grouped query attention, and
multi-head attention. The study assessed the model's performance on four
publicly accessible datasets and concentrated on identifying binary and
multiclass issues across various categories. This paper also takes into account
of the explainability of AD's progression and compared with state-of-the-art
methods namely Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), Score-CAM, Faster
Score-CAM, and XGRADCAM. Our methodology consistently outperforms current
approaches, achieving 99.66\% accuracy in 4-class classification, 99.63\% in
3-class classification, and 100\% in binary classification using Kaggle
datasets. For Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets the
accuracies are 99.92\%, 99.90\%, and 99.95\% respectively. The Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset was used for experiments in
three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) and a combination of all planes.
The study achieved accuracies of 99.08\% for axis, 99.85\% for sagittal, 99.5\%
for coronal, and 99.17\% for all axis, and 97.79\% and 8.60\% respectively for
ADNI-2. The network's ability to retrieve important information from MRI images
is demonstrated by its excellent accuracy in categorizing AD stages.

Abstract: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and
surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is
laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical
images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,
termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise
clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary
segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are
determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the
design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level
labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,
ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.
Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,
ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a
two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori
information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the
smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to
measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and
evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具仅适用于高分辨率T1w扫描，无法处理临床MR扫描的异质性，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 使用合成域随机化数据训练神经网络，通过模板网格变形估计白质和灰质表面，保证拓扑正确性。

Result: 与现有方法相比，皮质厚度误差减少约50%（从0.50降至0.24毫米），并更好地恢复了与衰老相关的皮质变薄模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床扫描提供了快速准确的表面重建，支持大规模研究和难以招募的临床人群分析。

Abstract: Surface-based cortical analysis is valuable for a variety of neuroimaging
tasks, such as spatial normalization, parcellation, and gray matter (GM)
thickness estimation. However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work
exclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a
specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This
precludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very
heterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic
domain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit
estimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution,
without retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM)
surface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further
deformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to
recon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is
currently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR
scans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately
50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect
to RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns
detected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans. Our method enables fast
and accurate surface reconstruction of clinical scans, allowing studies (1)
with sample sizes far beyond what is feasible in a research setting, and (2) of
clinical populations that are difficult to enroll in research studies. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/simnibs/brainnet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了NOVA基准测试，用于评估模型在真实临床环境中处理罕见和未知病理的能力，揭示了现有视觉语言模型在极端分布外泛化中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在训练数据分布外的泛化能力不足，尤其是在医疗影像领域，罕见或新出现的病理条件可能导致模型失效。

Method: 提出了NOVA基准测试，包含约900个脑部MRI扫描，涵盖281种罕见病理和异构采集协议，用于评估模型的异常定位、视觉描述和诊断推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，领先的视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash和Qwen2.5-VL-72B）在NOVA基准测试中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: NOVA为评估和提升模型在极端分布外泛化能力提供了严格的测试平台。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ
from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies
whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world
recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as
ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed
without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on
large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across
domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test
sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation
back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel
conditions encountered in clinical use.
  We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$
benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and
heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical
narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these
enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and
diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an
$extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge
a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline
results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks,
establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect,
localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过调制时间上下文和参考帧的两步方法，显著提升了神经视频编码器（NVC）的性能，实现了比传统视频编码器H.266/VVC和现有NVC更高效的压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NVC在时间上下文传播机制中未能充分利用参考信息，限制了压缩性能的进一步提升。

Method: 1. 提出流导向方法挖掘参考帧与预测帧之间的相关性，生成额外的导向时间上下文；2. 引入上下文补偿机制，利用导向上下文调制传播的时间上下文。

Result: 实验结果显示，该编码器比H.266/VVC平均节省22.7%比特率，比现有NVC DCVC-FM平均节省10.1%比特率。

Conclusion: 通过两步调制机制和协同优化，显著提升了NVC的性能，为视频压缩领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient video coding is highly dependent on exploiting the temporal
redundancy, which is usually achieved by extracting and leveraging the temporal
context in the emerging conditional coding-based neural video codec (NVC).
Although the latest NVC has achieved remarkable progress in improving the
compression performance, the inherent temporal context propagation mechanism
lacks the ability to sufficiently leverage the reference information, limiting
further improvement. In this paper, we address the limitation by modulating the
temporal context with the reference frame in two steps. Specifically, we first
propose the flow orientation to mine the inter-correlation between the
reference frame and prediction frame for generating the additional oriented
temporal context. Moreover, we introduce the context compensation to leverage
the oriented context to modulate the propagated temporal context generated from
the propagated reference feature. Through the synergy mechanism and decoupling
loss supervision, the irrelevant propagated information can be effectively
eliminated to ensure better context modeling. Experimental results demonstrate
that our codec achieves on average 22.7% bitrate reduction over the advanced
traditional video codec H.266/VVC, and offers an average 10.1% bitrate saving
over the previous state-of-the-art NVC DCVC-FM. The code is available at

Motivation: 逆散射问题在成像应用中至关重要，但需要同时估计图像和散射场，传统方法缺乏有效的图像先验。

Method: 结合神经场和去噪评分函数，利用神经场的灵活性进行联合估计，并通过评分函数引入图像结构先验。

Result: 在三个高对比度模拟对象上，新方法成像质量优于基于总变分的现有NF方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入评分函数作为先验，显著提升了逆散射问题的成像效果。

Abstract: Inverse scattering is a fundamental challenge in many imaging applications,
ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. Solving this problem often requires
jointly estimating two unknowns -- the image and the scattering field inside
the object -- necessitating effective image prior to regularize the inference.
In this paper, we propose a regularized neural field (NF) approach which
integrates the denoising score function used in score-based generative models.
The neural field formulation offers convenient flexibility to performing joint
estimation, while the denoising score function imposes the rich structural
prior of images. Our results on three high-contrast simulated objects show that
the proposed approach yields a better imaging quality compared to the
state-of-the-art NF approach, where regularization is based on total variation.

Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US)
Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression
through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived
parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery
are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this
work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we
propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and
inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline
consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US
videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected
SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We
perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious
correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for
task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition
settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the
structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components
and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC:
0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71,
$\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of
4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline
can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development
of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的控制和编排方法存在局限性，Pel旨在提供更强大、安全和高效的解决方案。

Method: Pel结合Lisp、Elixir、Gleam和Haskell的优势，设计为语法简单、语义丰富的语言，支持复杂操作、控制流和代理间通信。

Result: Pel通过语法级控制、并行化等特性，为LLM编排提供了更健壮、安全的范式。

Conclusion: Pel为AI代理框架的复杂性和可靠性提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in
computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple
text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool
calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness,
scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control.
This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed
to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and
Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich
platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent
communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily
modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the
need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level.
Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition,
first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns,
built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an
advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and
LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel
incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static
dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel
offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration,
paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.

Motivation: 传统RTL设计方法手动且易错，商业LLM存在安全和隐私问题，开源模型因数据不足表现不佳，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 将RTL代码编码为文本化的控制流图和数据流图，利用图结构增强LLM的上下文理解能力，生成更高质量的代码。

Result: 实验表明，RTL++在VerilogEval基准测试中优于现有模型，证明了图增强上下文的有效性。

Conclusion: RTL++通过图表示显著提升了LLM辅助RTL代码生成的性能，为EDA自动化提供了新方向。

Abstract: As hardware design complexity escalates, there is an urgent need for advanced
automation in electronic design automation (EDA). Traditional register transfer
level (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
While commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows
promising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns.
Open-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in
quality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data
essential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++,
a first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes
graph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated
code. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data
flow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and
relationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances
the context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate
instructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations,
RTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code
and suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++
outperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated
using the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1
model, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing
the capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.

Result: FedKBP+在三个预测任务中表现出高效、稳健和有效性。

Conclusion: FedKBP+作为联邦学习平台，在放疗领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and
consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by
the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among
institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could
alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns
about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work
aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated
learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in
radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified
communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support
communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or
distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the
centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source
frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where
participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer
communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using
scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our
results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust,
showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.

Motivation: 随着序列建模需求的增长，传统硬件架构在计算注意力和处理长序列时面临效率和成本挑战。

Result: 在28nm ASIC技术中，面积和功耗分别平均降低了28.8%和17.6%。

Conclusion: ExpMul算子为FlashAttention硬件加速器提供了高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly within Transformer architectures and large
language models (LLMs), have revolutionized sequence modeling in machine
learning and artificial intelligence applications. To compute attention for
increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to
execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently
proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention
algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized
computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we
focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new
hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector
multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators
significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware
accelerators. When implemented in a 28nm ASIC technology, they achieve
improvements of 28.8% in area and 17.6% in power, on average, compared to
state-of-the-art hardware architectures with separate exponentials and vector
multiplications hardware operators.

Motivation: SPARQL查询对非专家用户具有挑战性，且现有知识图谱的示例查询有限，需要一种自动化方法生成高质量查询。

Method: Q²Forge采用模块化设计，包括能力问题生成、查询生成和查询优化模块，支持独立使用或集成流程。

Result: Q²Forge实现了从能力问题到查询评估的完整流程，支持为任意知识图谱创建参考查询集。

Conclusion: Q²Forge为知识图谱的查询生成提供了通用、可扩展的解决方案，填补了现有工具的空白。

Abstract: The SPARQL query language is the standard method to access knowledge graphs
(KGs). However, formulating SPARQL queries is a significant challenge for
non-expert users, and remains time-consuming for the experienced ones. Best
practices recommend to document KGs with competency questions and example
queries to contextualise the knowledge they contain and illustrate their
potential applications. In practice, however, this is either not the case or
the examples are provided in limited numbers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
being used in conversational agents and are proving to be an attractive
solution with a wide range of applications, from simple question-answering
about common knowledge to generating code in a targeted programming language.
However, training and testing these models to produce high quality SPARQL
queries from natural language questions requires substantial datasets of
question-query pairs. In this paper, we present Q${}^2$Forge that addresses the
challenge of generating new competency questions for a KG and corresponding
SPARQL queries. It iteratively validates those queries with human feedback and
LLM as a judge. Q${}^2$Forge is open source, generic, extensible and modular,
meaning that the different modules of the application (CQ generation, query
generation and query refinement) can be used separately, as an integrated
pipeline, or replaced by alternative services. The result is a complete
pipeline from competency question formulation to query evaluation, supporting
the creation of reference query sets for any target KG.

Abstract: LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large
collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have
enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of
semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with
natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters,
joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction,
summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved
strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An
optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each
semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing
optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most
(if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to
constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an
extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of
a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization
objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of
validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator
performance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the
biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering
(MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2%
better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next
best system.

Motivation: MSDA在视觉任务中表现优异，但其随机访问网格采样策略在NPU等专用加速器上存在优化挑战。

Method: 采用协同设计方法，重新设计内存访问和计算策略，支持高效的前向和反向计算，并包含硬件感知优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在正向、反向和端到端训练中分别实现了最高5.9倍、8.9倍和7.3倍的加速，优于基线及最新厂商库。

Conclusion: 协同设计方法显著提升了MSDA在NPU上的计算效率，适用于训练任务。

Abstract: Multi-scale deformable attention (MSDA) is a flexible and powerful feature
extraction mechanism for visual tasks, but its random-access grid sampling
strategy poses significant optimization challenges, especially on
domain-specific accelerators such as NPUs. In this work, we present a co-design
approach that systematically rethinks memory access and computation strategies
for MSDA on the Ascend NPU architecture. With this co-design approach, our
implementation supports both efficient forward and backward computation, is
fully adapted for training workloads, and incorporates a suite of
hardware-aware optimizations. Extensive experiments show that our solution
achieves up to $5.9\times$ (forward), $8.9\times$ (backward), and $7.3\times$
(end-to-end training) speedup over the grid sample-based baseline, and
$1.9\times$, $2.4\times$, and $2.0\times$ acceleration over the latest vendor
library, respectively.

Method: PMF利用PMA和PMSA动态选择和切换算法，基于性能指标实现自适应优化。

Result: 实验表明，PMF在高维、动态和多模态环境中显著提升收敛速度和解质量。

Conclusion: PMF为智能优化框架提供了新方向，适用于工程、物流等复杂系统。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex optimization
problems, yet their effectiveness is often constrained by fixed structures and
the need for extensive tuning. The Polymorphic Metaheuristic Framework (PMF)
addresses this limitation by introducing a self-adaptive metaheuristic
switching mechanism driven by real-time performance feedback and dynamic
algorithmic selection. PMF leverages the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Agent (PMA)
and the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Selection Agent (PMSA) to dynamically select
and transition between metaheuristic algorithms based on key performance
indicators, ensuring continuous adaptation. This approach enhances convergence
speed, adaptability, and solution quality, outperforming traditional
metaheuristics in high-dimensional, dynamic, and multimodal environments.
Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate that PMF significantly
improves optimization efficiency by mitigating stagnation and balancing
exploration-exploitation strategies across various problem landscapes. By
integrating AI-driven decision-making and self-correcting mechanisms, PMF paves
the way for scalable, intelligent, and autonomous optimization frameworks, with
promising applications in engineering, logistics, and complex decision-making
systems.

Motivation: 解决组合优化问题中如何整合外部知识以导向领域适用结果的挑战。

Method: 使用约束动作空间的强化学习方法，结合Wedge和Ring Transformer生成图形分区。

Result: 在交通网络领域生成了更接近自然最优分区的楔形和环形分区。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可推广到其他领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an important paradigm to solve
combinatorial optimization problems primarily due to its ability to learn
heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating
external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions
towards domain appropriate outcomes remains an extremely challenging task. In
this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action
spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template
instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a
Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in
form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal
partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that
can be generalized to other domains.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在计算Wasserstein重心时存在计算复杂性和理论限制，需要简化算法并提高效率。

Method: 基于Sobolev几何的SGA算法，避免了昂贵的c-凹投影操作，简化了计算过程。

Result: SGA算法在收敛速度和计算效率上优于现有方法，数值实验验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SGA算法为Wasserstein重心的计算提供了高效且理论简化的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the
Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to
the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA)
algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a
regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global
convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient
descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean
space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally
expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual
potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant
algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual
methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal
transport barycenter solvers.

Result: 算法具有可扩展性，无需调参，并在温和条件下收敛。

Conclusion: 算法在代表性双层任务中表现有效，证明了其理论收敛性。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is
nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We
propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime
feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality
condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each
iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a
closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking
line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly
positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no
hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions.
We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

Conclusion: 该算法成功实现了对抗性鲁棒分类器的高效学习，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We say that a classifier is \emph{adversarially robust} to perturbations of
norm $r$ if, with high probability over a point $x$ drawn from the input
distribution, there is no point within distance $\le r$ from $x$ that is
classified differently. The \emph{boundary volume} is the probability that a
point falls within distance $r$ of a point with a different label. This work
studies the task of computationally efficient learning of hypotheses with small
boundary volume, where the input is distributed as a subgaussian isotropic
log-concave distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Linear threshold functions are adversarially robust; they have boundary
volume proportional to $r$. Such concept classes are efficiently learnable by
polynomial regression, which produces a polynomial threshold function (PTF),
but PTFs in general may have boundary volume $\Omega(1)$, even for $r \ll 1$.
  We give an algorithm that agnostically learns linear threshold functions and
returns a classifier with boundary volume $O(r+\varepsilon)$ at radius of
perturbation $r$. The time and sample complexity of
$d^{\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ matches the complexity of polynomial
regression.
  Our algorithm augments the classic approach of polynomial regression with
three additional steps: a) performing the $\ell_1$-error regression under noise
sensitivity constraints, b) a structured partitioning and rounding step that
returns a Boolean classifier with error $\textsf{opt} + O(\varepsilon)$ and
noise sensitivity $O(r+\varepsilon)$ simultaneously, and c) a local corrector
that ``smooths'' a function with low noise sensitivity into a function that is
adversarially robust.

Motivation: 现有多智能体系统依赖预定义角色和静态通信结构，限制了适应性和灵活性，导致在专业任务中表现不佳。

Method: HALO采用分层架构：高层规划代理分解任务，中层角色设计代理实例化子任务，低层推理代理执行子任务，并结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和自适应提示优化。

Result: 在代码生成、通用推理和数学推理等任务中，HALO平均提升14.4%，在专业任务中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: HALO通过分层协作和动态优化，显著提升了多智能体系统在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse task scenarios.
Nonetheless, existing agentic systems typically rely on predefined agent-role
design spaces and static communication structures, limiting their adaptability
as well as flexibility in complex interaction environments and leading to
subpar performance on highly specialized and expert-level tasks. To address
these issues, we introduce HALO, a multi-agent collaboration framework based on
a hierarchical reasoning architecture. Specifically, we incorporate a
high-level planning agent for task decomposition, mid-level role-design agents
for subtask-specific agent instantiation, and low-level inference agents for
subtask execution. Particularly, subtask execution is reformulated as a
structured workflow search problem, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
systematically explores the agentic action space to construct optimal reasoning
trajectories. Additionally, as the majority of users lack expertise in prompt
engineering, we leverage an Adaptive Prompt Refinement module to transform raw
queries into task-specific prompts. Empirical evaluations on Code Generation
(HumanEval), General Reasoning (MMLU), and Arithmetic Reasoning (MATH)
benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of HALO, yielding a 14.4%
average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, HALO achieves up
to 13.3% performance gain on the Moral Scenarios subject in the MMLU benchmark
and up to 19.6% performance gain on the Algebra subarea in the MATH benchmark,
indicating its advanced proficiency in tackling highly specialized and
expert-level tasks. The code repository is available at

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, the proliferation of

Conclusion: MLZero在多模态数据自动化处理中具有显著优势，即使使用小型LLM也能保持高效。

Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning
(ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert
input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel
multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables
end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human
intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw
multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the
subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated
code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code
generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates
superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both
success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when
evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more
challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the
competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and
an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even

Conclusion: 通过参数调节，算法能灵活平衡个性化和鲁棒性，适用于复杂分布式学习场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in
multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience.
Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models
tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the
other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous
training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between
these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that
combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion
dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the
neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily
controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more
personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of
our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it
achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious
agents compared to standard strategies.

Abstract: Extracting alphanumeric data from form-like documents such as invoices,

Our work highlights the limitations of monolithic LLM-based extraction and
introduces a modular, multi-agent framework with task-specific prompts and an
RL policy of rewards and penalties to guide a meta-prompting agent to learn
from past errors and improve prompt-based actor agents. This self-corrective
adaptive system handles diverse documents, file formats, layouts, and LLMs,
aiming to automate accurate information extraction without the need for human

Conclusion: JETRTQA通过改进语义表示和检索相关性，显著提升了多模态教科书问答性能。

Abstract: Textbook question answering (TQA) is a complex task, requiring the
interpretation of complex multimodal context. Although recent advances have
improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational
settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval
are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal
textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic
representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint
Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering
(JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator
architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a
multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to
improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts.
Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the
semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal
that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers.
We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant
documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA
outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy
on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.

Motivation: LLM在语义理解和上下文推理方面表现优异，但在空间任务（如POI推荐）中面临地理坐标建模和POI关系捕捉的挑战。

Method: 提出GA-LLM框架，包含地理坐标注入模块（GCIM）和POI对齐模块（PAM），分别用于地理特征建模和POI关系学习。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上验证了GA-LLM的优越性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GA-LLM通过增强LLM的空间建模能力，显著提升了POI推荐的准确性。

Abstract: The next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict users'
next destinations based on their historical movement data and plays a key role
in location-based services and personalized applications. Accurate next POI
recommendation depends on effectively modeling geographic information and POI
transition relations, which are crucial for capturing spatial dependencies and
user movement patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong
capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning, applying them
to spatial tasks like next POI recommendation remains challenging. First, the
infrequent nature of specific GPS coordinates makes it difficult for LLMs to
model precise spatial contexts. Second, the lack of knowledge about POI
transitions limits their ability to capture potential POI-POI relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GA-LLM (Geography-Aware Large Language Model),
a novel framework that enhances LLMs with two specialized components. The
Geographic Coordinate Injection Module (GCIM) transforms GPS coordinates into
spatial representations using hierarchical and Fourier-based positional
encoding, enabling the model to understand geographic features from multiple
perspectives. The POI Alignment Module (PAM) incorporates POI transition
relations into the LLM's semantic space, allowing it to infer global POI
relationships and generalize to unseen POIs. Experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GA-LLM.

Motivation: 传统攻击策略依赖简单启发式方法，需访问内部数据且忽视文本评论的操纵潜力，因此需要更高效且隐蔽的攻击方法。

Result: 实验表明，Agent4SR在多个数据集和推荐系统架构上优于现有低知识基线，攻击效果和隐蔽性更佳。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的代理带来新型威胁，突显现代推荐系统亟需加强防御。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are increasingly vulnerable to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake user profiles to manipulate system outputs.
Traditional attack strategies often rely on simplistic heuristics, require
access to internal RS data, and overlook the manipulation potential of textual
reviews. In this work, we introduce Agent4SR, a novel framework that leverages
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to perform low-knowledge, high-impact
shilling attacks through both rating and review generation. Agent4SR simulates
realistic user behavior by orchestrating adversarial interactions, selecting
items, assigning ratings, and crafting reviews, while maintaining behavioral
plausibility. Our design includes targeted profile construction, hybrid memory
retrieval, and a review attack strategy that propagates target item features
across unrelated reviews to amplify manipulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets and RS architectures demonstrate that Agent4SR outperforms
existing low-knowledge baselines in both effectiveness and stealth. Our
findings reveal a new class of emergent threats posed by LLM-driven agents,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced defenses in modern recommender
systems.

Conclusion: BLOCKIE通过语义块处理显著提升了VRD信息提取的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) containing
layout features along with text is a critical and well-studied task.
Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using
both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named
entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack
reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents,
and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLM-based approaches
proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues
from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do
not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In
this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs
into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called $\textit{semantic
blocks}$, which are processed independently. Through focused and more
generalizable reasoning,our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public
VRD benchmarks by 1-3% in F1 scores, is resilient to document formats
previously not encountered and shows abilities to correctly extract information
not explicitly present in documents.

TL;DR: RAGXplain是一个评估框架，通过量化RAG性能并提供可操作的改进建议，帮助用户理解和优化复杂的RAG系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG评估方法仅提供定量分数，缺乏对复杂管道的可操作指导，RAGXplain旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用LLM推理将原始分数转化为清晰的叙述，识别性能差距并提出改进建议。

Result: 实验表明，RAGXplain的评估与人类判断一致，其建议显著提升了系统性能。

Conclusion: RAGXplain连接了定量评估与实际优化，增强了用户对AI系统的理解和信任。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show promise by coupling large
language models with external knowledge, yet traditional RAG evaluation methods
primarily report quantitative scores while offering limited actionable guidance
for refining these complex pipelines. In this paper, we introduce RAGXplain, an
evaluation framework that quantifies RAG performance and translates these
assessments into clear insights that clarify the workings of its complex,
multi-stage pipeline and offer actionable recommendations. Using LLM reasoning,
RAGXplain converts raw scores into coherent narratives identifying performance
gaps and suggesting targeted improvements. By providing transparent
explanations for AI decision-making, our framework fosters user trust-a key
challenge in AI adoption. Our LLM-based metric assessments show strong
alignment with human judgments, and experiments on public question-answering
datasets confirm that applying RAGXplain's actionable recommendations
measurably improves system performance. RAGXplain thus bridges quantitative
evaluation and practical optimization, empowering users to understand, trust,
and enhance their AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大语言模型（LLM）在检索增强生成（RAG）设置中对外部知识库（OOKB）鲁棒性的新方法，并开发了开源工具knowornot。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在高风险应用中的幻觉风险，需要一种无需人工标注的方法评估其在RAG设置中是否知道答案。

Method: 提出了一种系统评估OOKB鲁棒性的方法，开发了开源库knowornot，支持用户自定义评估数据和流程。

Result: knowornot提供了统一的API、模块化架构、严格的数据建模和工具套件，并通过PolicyBench验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: knowornot为评估LLM在RAG中的OOKB鲁棒性提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have progressed
significantly, their use in high-stakes applications have been limited due to
risks of hallucination. One key approach in reducing hallucination is
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but even in such setups, LLMs may still
hallucinate when presented with questions outside of the knowledge base. Such
behavior is unacceptable in high-stake applications where LLMs are expected to
abstain from answering queries it does not have sufficient context on. In this
work, we present a novel methodology for systematically evaluating
out-of-knowledge base (OOKB) robustness of LLMs (whether LLMs know or do not
know) in the RAG setting, without the need for manual annotation of gold
standard answers. We implement our methodology in knowornot, an open-source
library that enables users to develop their own customized evaluation data and
pipelines for OOKB robustness. knowornot comprises four main features. Firstly,
it provides a unified, high-level API that streamlines the process of setting
up and running robustness benchmarks. Secondly, its modular architecture
emphasizes extensibility and flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate
their own LLM clients and RAG settings. Thirdly, its rigorous data modeling
design ensures experiment reproducibility, reliability and traceability.
Lastly, it implements a comprehensive suite of tools for users to customize
their pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of knowornot by developing a
challenging benchmark, PolicyBench, which spans four Question-Answer (QA)
chatbots on government policies, and analyze its OOKB robustness. The source

TL;DR: 该论文首次提出了即时信息推荐（JIR）任务的数学定义和评估框架，并引入了多模态基准数据集JIR-Arena，用于评估JIR系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对JIR任务的系统性定义和评估方法，阻碍了相关技术的发展。

Method: 提出了JIR任务的数学定义，开发了JIR-Arena数据集，并设计了一个基线JIR系统进行验证。

Result: 基线系统在JIR-Arena上表现出合理的需求推断精度，但在召回率和内容检索效果上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 论文为JIR研究提供了基础框架和数据集，支持未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Just-in-time Information Recommendation (JIR) is a service designed to
deliver the most relevant information precisely when users need it, ,
addressing their knowledge gaps with minimal effort and boosting
decision-making and efficiency in daily life. Advances in device-efficient
deployment of foundation models and the growing use of intelligent wearable
devices have made always-on JIR assistants feasible. However, there has been no
systematic effort to formally define JIR tasks or establish evaluation
frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present the first mathematical definition of
JIR tasks and associated evaluation metrics. Additionally, we introduce
JIR-Arena, a multimodal benchmark dataset featuring diverse,
information-request-intensive scenarios to evaluate JIR systems across critical
dimensions: i) accurately inferring user information needs, ii) delivering
timely and relevant recommendations, and iii) avoiding irrelevant content that
may distract users.
  Developing a JIR benchmark dataset poses challenges due to subjectivity in
estimating user information needs and uncontrollable system variables affecting
reproducibility. To address these, JIR-Arena: i) combines input from multiple
humans and large AI models to approximate information need distributions; ii)
assesses JIR quality through information retrieval outcomes using static
knowledge base snapshots; and iii) employs a multi-turn, multi-entity
validation framework to improve objectivity and generality. Furthermore, we
implement a baseline JIR system capable of processing real-time information
streams aligned with user inputs. Our evaluation of this baseline system on
JIR-Arena indicates that while foundation model-based JIR systems simulate user
needs with reasonable precision, they face challenges in recall and effective
content retrieval. To support future research in this new area, we fully
release our code and data.

Motivation: 当前QA任务的基准测试缺乏元数据集成，限制了在需要结合文本和外部信息的场景下的评估。AMAQA旨在填补这一空白，尤其在需要快速分析数据的领域（如网络安全和情报）中发挥作用。

Method: AMAQA数据集包含从26个公共Telegram群组收集的110万条英文消息，并添加了时间戳、主题、情感基调等元数据。通过450个QA对，评估了元数据对RAG系统的影响。

Result: 利用元数据可将准确性从0.12提升至0.61。通过迭代上下文和添加噪声文档的策略，进一步比最佳基线提高了3个百分点。

Conclusion: AMAQA是首个结合元数据的单跳QA基准测试，为未来研究设定了新标准，展示了元数据在提升QA任务性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely used in
question-answering (QA) tasks, but current benchmarks lack metadata
integration, hindering evaluation in scenarios requiring both textual data and
external information. To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA
dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration
of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of
large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely
access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million
English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with
metadata such as timestamps, topics, emotional tones, and toxicity indicators,
which enable precise and contextualized queries by filtering documents based on
specific criteria. It also includes 450 high-quality QA pairs, making it a
valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems.
To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to
incorporate metadata and labels such as topics covered in the messages. We
conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, establishing a new standard for
future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.12 to
0.61, highlighting the value of structured context. Building on this, we
explore several strategies to refine the LLM input by iterating over provided
context and enriching it with noisy documents, achieving a further 3-point gain
over the best baseline and a 14-point improvement over simple metadata
filtering. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用历史会话数据，难以捕捉用户意图的动态变化，因此需要整合未来上下文信息。

Method: 提出双模型框架（历史条件模型和未来感知模型），通过协同训练和动态门控机制优化。

Result: 实验证明ForeRanker在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 整合未来上下文信息能有效提升文档排序性能，动态门控机制解决了训练不一致问题。

Abstract: In the realm of information retrieval, users often engage in multi-turn
interactions with search engines to acquire information, leading to the
formation of sequences of user feedback behaviors. Leveraging the session
context has proven to be beneficial for inferring user search intent and
document ranking. A multitude of approaches have been proposed to exploit
in-session context for improved document ranking. Despite these advances, the
limitation of historical session data for capturing evolving user intent
remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the integration of future
contextual information into the session context to enhance document ranking. We
present the siamese model optimization framework, comprising a
history-conditioned model and a future-aware model. The former processes only
the historical behavior sequence, while the latter integrates both historical
and anticipated future behaviors. Both models are trained collaboratively using
the supervised labels and pseudo labels predicted by the other. The
history-conditioned model, referred to as ForeRanker, progressively learns
future-relevant information to enhance ranking, while it singly uses historical
session at inference time. To mitigate inconsistencies during training, we
introduce the peer knowledge distillation method with a dynamic gating
mechanism, allowing models to selectively incorporate contextual information.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
ForeRanker, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在医学文档语义捕捉、长文本处理和通用任务中表现不佳，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: MedEIR结合ALiBi长上下文处理技术，预训练60亿token，并在300万句对上微调。

Result: 在多个MTEB基准测试中，MedEIR表现优于Jina V2和MiniLM，尤其在医学相关任务上。

Conclusion: MedEIR展示了在通用和特定领域任务中的高效性，是现有嵌入模型的强有力替代。

Abstract: Embedding models have become essential for retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) tasks, semantic clustering, and text re-ranking. But despite their
growing use, many of these come with notable limitations. For example, Jina
fails to capture the semantic content of medical documents, while models such
as MiniLM often perform poorly on long-form documents. Domain-adapted models,
while specialized, often underperform in general-purpose tasks, reducing their
overall applicability. General-domain tokenizers often misinterpret medical
vocabulary. The limitations of current embedding models, whether in
tokenization accuracy, domain comprehension, or handling long sequences,
highlight the need for more versatile solutions. In this work, we present
MedEIR, a novel embedding model and tokenizer jointly optimized for both
medical and general NLP tasks, incorporating ALiBi-based long-context
processing to support sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. MedEIR was pre-trained
on only 6 billion tokens, significantly fewer than Jina's, followed by
fine-tuning on 3 million sentence pairs. MedEIR consistently outperforms Jina
V2 and MiniLM across MTEB benchmarks, achieving top scores on ArguAna (55.24),
NFCorpus (38.44), MedicalQARetrieval (74.25), SciFact (72.04), and TRECCOVID
(79.56). These results highlight the potential of MedEIR as a highly effective
embedding model, demonstrating strong performance across both general-purpose
and domain-specific tasks and outperforming existing models on multiple
benchmarks.

Result: RAR性能与Claude 3.5 Sonnet等模型的内置审核相当，但更具灵活性和实时定制能力。

Conclusion: RAR无需改变现有RAG架构，仅需添加特殊文档和简单拒绝机制，是一种高效的内容审核解决方案。

Abstract: Content moderation for large language models (LLMs) remains a significant
challenge, requiring flexible and adaptable solutions that can quickly respond
to emerging threats. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Rejection (RAR),
a novel approach that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
architecture to dynamically reject unsafe user queries without model
retraining. By strategically inserting and marking malicious documents into the
vector database, the system can identify and reject harmful requests when these
documents are retrieved. Our preliminary results show that RAR achieves
comparable performance to embedded moderation in LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
while offering superior flexibility and real-time customization capabilities, a
fundamental feature to timely address critical vulnerabilities. This approach
introduces no architectural changes to existing RAG systems, requiring only the
addition of specially crafted documents and a simple rejection mechanism based
on retrieval results.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs),
recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling,
resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of
fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance
between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are
naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference.
First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond
simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore
tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of
relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search
engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when
confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for
relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss
function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across
various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the
generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the
Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate
samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to
simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the
performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the
Alipay's insurance product search...

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学检索中，文档重新排序对优化检索结果至关重要，但LLM列表式重新排序面临候选文档数量受限和相关文档排名低的问题。

Method: CoRank框架分三阶段：离线提取文档级特征、基于紧凑表示的粗粒度重新排序、对候选文档全文的细粒度重新排序。

Result: 在LitSearch和CSFCube上的实验表明，CoRank显著提升了nDCG@10（从32.0到39.7）。

Conclusion: 信息提取在科学检索重新排序中具有重要价值，CoRank框架为提升性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific retrieval is essential for advancing academic discovery. Within
this process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage
retrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces
unique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often
suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.
Moreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate
documents in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be
considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,
which constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we
explore compact document representations based on semantic features such as
categories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic
reranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework
involves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)
coarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained
reranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid
design provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands
candidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.
Experiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves
reranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from
32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information
extraction for reranking in scientific retrieval.

Motivation: 现有LLM增强方法需要处理大量文本描述，计算成本高，LLaCTR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LLaCTR利用LLM从小规模特征字段中提取轻量级语义知识，并通过自监督字段特征微调增强特征表示和交互。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，LLaCTR在性能和效率上优于现有LLM增强方法。

Conclusion: LLaCTR是一种高效且有效的CTR预测方法，适用于大规模推荐系统。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern
recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models
(LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR
methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive
processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or
user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address
this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight
LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm.
Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight
semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised
field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic
knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In
our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across
four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both
effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaCTR-EC46.

Motivation: 解决现有神经重排序模型资源消耗大、效率低的问题，同时利用大型语言模型的推理能力提升检索效果。

Method: 提出Rank-K模型，通过列表式段落重排序，利用推理语言模型在查询时的推理能力，实现高效的多语言检索。

Result: Rank-K在BM25初始排名列表上比现有最佳模型RankZephyr提升23%，在SPLADE-v3结果上提升19%，且在多语言检索中表现同样出色。

Conclusion: Rank-K通过高效推理能力显著提升了检索效果，尤其在多语言环境中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Retrieve-and-rerank is a popular retrieval pipeline because of its ability to
make slow but effective rerankers efficient enough at query time by reducing
the number of comparisons. Recent works in neural rerankers take advantage of
large language models for their capability in reasoning between queries and
passages and have achieved state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness. However,
such rerankers are resource-intensive, even after heavy optimization. In this
work, we introduce Rank-K, a listwise passage reranking model that leverages
the reasoning capability of the reasoning language model at query time that
provides test time scalability to serve hard queries. We show that Rank-K
improves retrieval effectiveness by 23\% over the RankZephyr, the
state-of-the-art listwise reranker, when reranking a BM25 initial ranked list
and 19\% when reranking strong retrieval results by SPLADE-v3. Since Rank-K is
inherently a multilingual model, we found that it ranks passages based on
queries in different languages as effectively as it does in monolingual
retrieval.

Result: 实验证明方法在多个领域数据上表现优异，并成功应用于淘宝App的实际推荐场景。

Conclusion: TranSUN和GTS为推荐系统提供了理论保障和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However,
retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the
community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias
correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model,
facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems.
Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically
from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN
method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically
guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further
generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized
TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves
as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods
across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two
real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video
recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage
of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform), to serve the major online
traffic. Codes will be released after this paper is published.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI搜索虽然便捷，但缺乏传统Web搜索的细粒度用户反馈机制，导致难以持续改进中间阶段。

Method: NExT-Search设计了两种模式：用户调试模式和影子用户模式，结合在线适应和离线更新，优化搜索流程。

Result: 通过恢复人类对关键阶段的控制，NExT-Search为构建反馈丰富的AI搜索系统提供了方向。

Conclusion: NExT-Search有望实现生成式AI搜索与人类反馈的持续协同进化。

Abstract: Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering
end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually
browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm
enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has
historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can
continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,
fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In
contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,
spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet
typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This
introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output
cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it
difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In
this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to
reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.
NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows
engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a
personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted
feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these
feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines
current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates
interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and
generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative
AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for
building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside
human feedback.

Result: CausalEPP在减少流行度偏差的同时提高了推荐准确性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CausalEPP通过动态个性化方法有效解决了推荐系统中的流行度偏差问题。

Abstract: Popularity bias occurs when popular items are recommended far more frequently
than they should be, negatively impacting both user experience and
recommendation accuracy. Existing debiasing methods mitigate popularity bias
often uniformly across all users and only partially consider the time evolution
of users or items. However, users have different levels of preference for item
popularity, and this preference is evolving over time. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method called CausalEPP (Causal Intervention on Evolving
Personal Popularity) for taming recommendation bias, which accounts for the
evolving personal popularity of users. Specifically, we first introduce a
metric called {Evolving Personal Popularity} to quantify each user's preference
for popular items. Then, we design a causal graph that integrates evolving
personal popularity into the conformity effect, and apply deconfounded training
to mitigate the popularity bias of the causal graph. During inference, we
consider the evolution consistency between users and items to achieve a better
recommendation. Empirical studies demonstrate that CausalEPP outperforms
baseline methods in reducing popularity bias while improving recommendation
accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的可信声誉系统模型，通过博弈论方法确保用户真实报告对服务器可信度的信念，并支持其在区块链中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有声誉系统易受操纵，缺乏经济稳健性的博弈论支持，因此需要设计一种可信的声誉系统模型。

Method: 提出了一类称为“可信声誉博弈”的游戏，用户在其中报告对服务器可信度的真实信念，确保其策略是最佳响应，并能估计服务器的相对可信度。

Result: 通过将PageRank算法与可信度发现问题结合，设计了一种解码函数，证明了该模型在声誉证明（PoR）区块链中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该模型为可信声誉系统提供了博弈论基础，并展示了其在区块链中的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Reputation systems play an essential role in the Internet era, as they enable
people to decide whom to trust, by collecting and aggregating data about users'
behavior. Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design
and scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however,
such systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic
treatment exists that can support their economic robustness.
  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\em
trustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games,
which we term {\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to
report a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in
a set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave
according to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following
properties:
  1. It is $(\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play
a prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.
  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\em true}
trustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium
allows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative
trustworthiness of any two servers.
  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well
known PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which
can be of independent interest. Finally, we show how the above games are
motivated by and can be leveraged in proof-of-reputation (PoR) blockchains.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了聚合物科学中数据碎片化问题及其对能源技术发展的阻碍，提出了通过技术、协作和开放科学解决这些挑战的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚合物科学中缺乏可互操作的数据库，导致数据碎片化，阻碍了机器学习应用和关键材料的发现，影响了全球脱碳进程。

Method: 采用自然语言处理工具从文献中提取结构化数据，利用高通量机器人平台生成自洽数据集，并应用FAIR原则确保数据的机器可读性和可重复性。

Result: 通过技术创新和协作治理，可以解决数据碎片化问题，推动聚合物科学的发展。

Conclusion: 未来突破依赖于开放科学的文化转变，结合去中心化数据市场和自主实验室，将数据瓶颈转化为加速器。

Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning
photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by
fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of
these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing
reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with
unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation
stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of
materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound
the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to
proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit
critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine
cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases
limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions
address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural
language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of
literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent
datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the
adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles,
adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and
reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open
science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories
that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing
data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance,
and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into
accelerants.

Method: 采用分层领域学习方法，结合低级和高级谓词与动作，利用仿真验证，并引入中心错误推理器确保一致性。

Result: 在两个国际规划竞赛（IPC）领域和一个长时程机器人操作任务中，规划成功率优于现有领域合成和LLM-modulo规划方法。

Conclusion: 分层方法有效提升了长时程规划的性能，同时构建了高质量的领域模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable planning from natural language
instructions using implicit world knowledge, but often produce flawed plans
that require refinement. Instead of directly predicting plans, recent methods
aim to learn a problem domain that can be solved for different goal states
using classical planners. However, these approaches require significant human
feedback to obtain useful models. We address this shortcoming by learning
hierarchical domains, where low-level predicates and actions are composed into
higher-level counterparts, and by leveraging simulation to validate their
preconditions and effects. This hierarchical approach is particularly powerful
for long-horizon planning, where LLM-based planning approaches typically
struggle. Furthermore, we introduce a central error reasoner to ensure
consistency among the different planning levels. Evaluation on two challenging
International Planning Competition (IPC) domains and a long-horizon robot
manipulation task demonstrates higher planning success rates than
state-of-the-art domain synthesis and LLM-modulo planning methods, while
constructing high-quality models of the domain. Resources, videos and detailed
experiment results are available at https://claudius-kienle.github.io/lodge/.

Conclusion: HPI和DSAC-H为安全强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), known for its self-evolution capability, offers
a promising approach to training high-level autonomous driving systems.
However, handling constraints remains a significant challenge for existing RL
algorithms, particularly in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose
a new safety-oriented training technique called harmonic policy iteration
(HPI). At each RL iteration, it first calculates two policy gradients
associated with efficient driving and safety constraints, respectively. Then, a
harmonic gradient is derived for policy updating, minimizing conflicts between
the two gradients and consequently enabling a more balanced and stable training
process. Furthermore, we adopt the state-of-the-art DSAC algorithm as the
backbone and integrate it with our HPI to develop a new safe RL algorithm,
DSAC-H. Extensive simulations in multi-lane scenarios demonstrate that DSAC-H
achieves efficient driving performance with near-zero safety constraint
violations.

Conclusion: SayCoNav通过LLM实现高效协作，适用于异构机器人团队。

Abstract: Adaptive collaboration is critical to a team of autonomous robots to perform
complicated navigation tasks in large-scale unknown environments. An effective
collaboration strategy should be determined and adapted according to each
robot's skills and current status to successfully achieve the shared goal. We
present SayCoNav, a new approach that leverages large language models (LLMs)
for automatically generating this collaboration strategy among a team of
robots. Building on the collaboration strategy, each robot uses the LLM to
generate its plans and actions in a decentralized way. By sharing information
to each other during navigation, each robot also continuously updates its
step-by-step plans accordingly. We evaluate SayCoNav on Multi-Object Navigation
(MultiON) tasks, that require the team of the robots to utilize their
complementary strengths to efficiently search multiple different objects in
unknown environments. By validating SayCoNav with varied team compositions and
conditions against baseline methods, our experimental results show that
SayCoNav can improve search efficiency by at most 44.28% through effective
collaboration among heterogeneous robots. It can also dynamically adapt to the
changing conditions during task execution.

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了复杂团队行为，并适应多样化对手策略。

Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained
locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer
offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive,
and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully
autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly
dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball
manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a
high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning
framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise
to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception,
and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed
learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive
multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped
robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization,
with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human
soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

Method: 提出GUIDE框架，利用TSUMs为不同位置分配可接受的不确定性水平，结合强化学习训练导航策略。

Result: 实际测试显示，GUIDE在任务完成和不确定性管理方面显著优于缺乏任务特定不确定性感知的方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE框架通过任务特定不确定性管理，有效提升了复杂环境中机器人导航的性能。

Abstract: Robots navigating complex environments must manage uncertainty from sensor
noise, environmental changes, and incomplete information, with different tasks
requiring varying levels of precision in different areas. For example, precise
localization may be crucial near obstacles but less critical in open spaces. We
present GUIDE (Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and
Execution), a framework that integrates these task-specific requirements into
navigation policies via Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs). By assigning
acceptable uncertainty levels to different locations, TSUMs enable robots to
adapt uncertainty management based on context. When combined with reinforcement
learning, GUIDE learns policies that balance task completion and uncertainty
management without extensive reward engineering. Real-world tests show
significant performance gains over methods lacking task-specific uncertainty
awareness.

Result: Safety2Drive提供了从场景构建到验证的标准化框架，支持自动驾驶的安全部署。

Conclusion: Safety2Drive为自动驾驶系统的安全评估和部署提供了全面且标准化的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems demand the high levels of safety assurance.
Despite significant advancements in AD demonstrated on open-source benchmarks
like Longest6 and Bench2Drive, existing datasets still lack
regulatory-compliant scenario libraries for closed-loop testing to
comprehensively evaluate the functional safety of AD. Meanwhile, real-world AD
accidents are underrepresented in current driving datasets. This scarcity leads
to inadequate evaluation of AD performance, posing risks to safety validation
and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose Safety2Drive,
a safety-critical scenario library designed to evaluate AD systems.
Safety2Drive offers three key contributions. (1) Safety2Drive comprehensively
covers the test items required by standard regulations and contains 70 AD
function test items. (2) Safety2Drive supports the safety-critical scenario
generalization. It has the ability to inject safety threats such as natural
environment corruptions and adversarial attacks cross camera and LiDAR sensors.
(3) Safety2Drive supports multi-dimensional evaluation. In addition to the
evaluation of AD systems, it also supports the evaluation of various perception
tasks, such as object detection and lane detection. Safety2Drive provides a
paradigm from scenario construction to validation, establishing a standardized
test framework for the safe deployment of AD.

Conclusion: 显式物理推理是连接语言智能与现实任务执行的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning
capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.
Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or
adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to
capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting
their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory
Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven
foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to
identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,
providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX
provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,
allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather
than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to
assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning
Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,
evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making
performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,
assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility
analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,
demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap
between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要大量人工标注，难以适应不同交互场景，且泛化能力有限。GSSM旨在通过无监督学习解决这些问题。

Method: GSSM利用神经网络学习正常驾驶的多向间距分布，基于极端值理论计算上下文自适应的风险评分。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上测试，GSSM的AUPRC达到0.9，预警时间中位数为2.6秒，性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GSSM为交通交互中的碰撞风险提供了一种可扩展、上下文感知且通用的量化方法。

Abstract: Accurate and timely alerts for drivers or automated systems to unfolding
collisions remains a challenge in road safety, particularly in highly
interactive urban traffic. Existing approaches require labour-intensive
annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying interaction context, or
are useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these
limits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),
a new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash
or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the
extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe
extreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by
context-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road
users. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails
higher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its
associated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values.
Any measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve
as part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical
interactions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which
are tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from
the SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of
0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential
collisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance
gains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and
crossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing
baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and
generalisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic
interactions.

Result: 在模拟线束装配任务中，相比现有方法，任务成功率更高且无安全违规。

Conclusion: 该方法在接触密集环境中实现了稳健且安全的可变形线性物体操作。

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) is challenging due to their
complex dynamics and the need for safe interaction in contact-rich
environments. Most existing models focus on shape prediction alone and fail to
account for contact and tension constraints, which can lead to damage to both
the DLO and the robot. In this work, we propose a certifiably safe motion
planning and control framework for DLO manipulation. At the core of our method
is a predictive model that jointly estimates the DLO's future shape and
tension. These predictions are integrated into a real-time trajectory optimizer
based on polynomial zonotopes, allowing us to enforce safety constraints
throughout the execution. We evaluate our framework on a simulated wire harness
assembly task using a 7-DOF robotic arm. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
our approach achieves a higher task success rate while avoiding all safety
violations. The results demonstrate that our method enables robust and safe DLO
manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Conclusion: TR-DRL通过利用时间反转对称性，显著提升了深度强化学习在机器人任务中的性能。

Abstract: Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve
sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing
approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation,
and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this
gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly
found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time
Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework
that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward
shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates
reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a
proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For
partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning,
according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive
experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL
is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher
sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must navigate and operate in diverse environments, from
terrestrial and aquatic settings to aerial and space domains. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific
autonomous robots, existing benchmarks are often constrained to unique
platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different
mobility systems. In this paper, we present NavBench, a multi-domain benchmark
for training and evaluating RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic
platforms and operational environments. Built on IsaacLab, our framework
standardizes task definitions, enabling different robots to tackle various
navigation challenges without the need for ad-hoc task redesigns or custom
evaluation metrics. Our benchmark addresses three key challenges: (1) Unified
cross-medium benchmarking, enabling direct evaluation of diverse actuation
methods (thrusters, wheels, water-based propulsion) in realistic environments;
(2) Scalable and modular design, facilitating seamless robot-task
interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; and (3) Robust
sim-to-real validation, demonstrated through successful policy transfer to
multiple real-world robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an
unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle. By ensuring consistency
between simulation and real-world deployment, NavBench simplifies the
development of adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design
allows researchers to easily integrate custom robots and tasks by following the
framework's predefined templates, making it accessible for a wide range of
applications. Our code is publicly available at NavBench.

Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure,
and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to
provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined
provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)
present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks
like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks.
Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010,
ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured
frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the
intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards,
highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while
maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational
software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software
engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including
requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation
maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks,
illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each
standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the
practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on
challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need
for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions
encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal
analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多步任务中表现不稳定，需要有效的搜索策略来缩小平均与最佳性能的差距。

Method: 研究了两种搜索策略：1步前瞻和轨迹选择，基于学习的动作价值函数估计。

Result: 在SWE-bench基准测试中，这些方法将Qwen-72B模型的平均成功率提升至40.8%，并适用于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 提出的搜索策略显著提升了LLMs在非序列化环境中的性能，且具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in
complex multi-step tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and agentic software
engineering. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance
across multiple solution attempts. One effective approach to narrow the gap
between average-case and best-case performance is guided test-time search,
which explores multiple solution paths to identify the most promising one.
Unfortunately, effective search techniques (e.g. MCTS) are often unsuitable for
non-serializable RL environments, such as Docker containers, where intermediate
environment states cannot be easily saved and restored. We investigate two
complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step
lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value
function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for
agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average
success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new
state-of-the-art for open-weights models. Additionally, we show that these
techniques are transferable to more advanced closed models, yielding similar
improvements with GPT-4o.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their
specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving
complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On
the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to
systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI
community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely
considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the
intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended
functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages.
Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but
scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by
automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which
leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from
true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to
learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for
unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among
non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning
algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of
code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation
as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation
paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code
generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of
leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code
hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code
generator.

TL;DR: 论文提出HarmonE架构，通过MAPE-K循环增强MLOps管道的自适应能力，解决MLS在多维度可持续性上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLS在动态环境中运行时面临数据漂移和模型退化等问题，传统MLOps仅关注技术维度，而忽略了经济、环境和社会维度的可持续性。

Method: 引入HarmonE架构，设计时定义可持续性目标和适应阈值，运行时监控关键指标（如预测精度、能耗等）并触发适应策略。

Result: 通过智能交通系统的数字孪生验证，HarmonE能有效适应变化条件，保持精度并满足可持续性目标。

Conclusion: HarmonE为MLS提供了一种多维度可持续性解决方案，未来可扩展至其他领域。

Abstract: Machine Learning Enabled Systems (MLS) are becoming integral to real-world
applications, but ensuring their sustainable performance over time remains a
significant challenge. These systems operate in dynamic environments and face
runtime uncertainties like data drift and model degradation, which affect the
sustainability of MLS across multiple dimensions: technical, economical,
environmental, and social. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses
the technical dimension by streamlining the ML model lifecycle, it overlooks
other dimensions. Furthermore, some traditional practices, such as frequent
retraining, incur substantial energy and computational overhead, thus
amplifying sustainability concerns. To address them, we introduce HarmonE, an
architectural approach that enables self-adaptive capabilities in MLOps
pipelines using the MAPE-K loop. HarmonE allows system architects to define
explicit sustainability goals and adaptation thresholds at design time, and
performs runtime monitoring of key metrics, such as prediction accuracy, energy
consumption, and data distribution shifts, to trigger appropriate adaptation
strategies. We validate our approach using a Digital Twin (DT) of an
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), focusing on traffic flow prediction as
our primary use case. The DT employs time series ML models to simulate
real-time traffic and assess various flow scenarios. Our results show that
HarmonE adapts effectively to evolving conditions while maintaining accuracy
and meeting sustainability goals.

Conclusion: 提出了未来在不平衡数据领域的潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant obstacle in machine learning, as an
unequal distribution of class labels often results in skewed predictions and
diminished model accuracy. To mitigate this problem, various resampling
strategies have been developed, encompassing both oversampling and
undersampling techniques aimed at modifying class proportions. Conventional
oversampling approaches like SMOTE enhance the representation of the minority
class, whereas undersampling methods focus on trimming down the majority class.
Advances in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more complex
solutions, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of producing high-quality synthetic
examples. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of data balancing methods,
classifying them into categories including synthetic oversampling, adaptive
techniques, generative models, ensemble-based strategies, hybrid approaches,
undersampling, and neighbor-based methods. Furthermore, it highlights current
developments in resampling techniques and discusses practical implementations
and case studies that validate their effectiveness. The paper concludes by
offering perspectives on potential directions for future exploration in this
domain.

Conclusion: CDG任务和NeuralLTO方法有效解决了多维连续域泛化问题，为复杂数据分布建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world data distributions often shift continuously across multiple latent
factors such as time, geography, and socioeconomic context. However, existing
domain generalization approaches typically treat domains as discrete or
evolving along a single axis (e.g., time), which fails to capture the complex,
multi-dimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the
task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize
predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of
continuous variation descriptors. We present a principled framework grounded in
geometric and algebraic theory, showing that optimal model parameters across
domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose
a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLTO), which enables structured parameter
transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To
handle noisy or incomplete domain descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism
to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets-including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic
forecasting-demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in generalization accuracy and robustness under descriptor
imperfections.

Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, with numerous
applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work
investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and
bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding
noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this
setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with
\citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism
(e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of
randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel
algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit
framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We
prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of
deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm
in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that
\coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms
classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic},
the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}.
These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning,
particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in
game-theoretic settings.

Result: PSGLA在非凸势能下收敛，且在合成数据和成像逆问题中表现优于SGLA。

Conclusion: PSGLA在保持恢复性能的同时，收敛速度更快，适用于非凸势能问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex
potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of
the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the
potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse
problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic
Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such
potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA
step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope
allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex
potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in
the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA
exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm
for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Result: 并行实现与串行实现性能相当，且在UQ方面优于现有方法，但时间成本较高。

Conclusion: SBMC方法在保持高准确性的同时，显著提升了UQ能力，成本与现有最优方法相当。

Abstract: This work introduces a new method called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo
(SBMC). The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior, and
the algorithm is a parallel implementation of a consistent (asymptotically
unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithm: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is motivated theoretically, and its
utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic
numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are
comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost,
and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like
deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty
quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel
implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger
than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid
degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point
estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately
delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，该方法在保持可计算覆盖保证的同时，实现了可解释且可控的预测集大小。

Conclusion: 反向共形预测在需要小预测集的应用中具有实用价值，同时保持了理论保证。

Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that
guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of
prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage
level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule
that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and
adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key
foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity
using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm
test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 -
\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any
data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out
estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage
$\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the
theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is
particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical
such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical
evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains
computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled
prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of
small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub
and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs,
our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs
where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new
condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs.
We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs,
as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph
mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and
social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.

Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular
depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions
is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are
singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information
Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the
breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address
this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely
Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC
and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature
settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we
theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite
their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an
asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior
distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship
between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and
deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical
contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational
efficiency of model selection in singular models.

Conclusion: 通过概率框架和实验验证，论文为递归训练中的模型崩溃问题提供了理论支持和实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, model collapse has become a critical issue in language model
training, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms driving
this phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate recursive parametric model
training from a probabilistic perspective, aiming to characterize the
conditions under which model collapse occurs and, crucially, how it can be
mitigated. We conceptualize the recursive training process as a random walk of
the model estimate, highlighting how the sample size influences the step size
and how the estimation procedure determines the direction and potential bias of
the random walk. Under mild conditions, we rigorously show that progressively
increasing the sample size at each training step is necessary to prevent model
collapse. In particular, when the estimation is unbiased, the required growth
rate follows a superlinear pattern. This rate needs to be accelerated even
further in the presence of substantial estimation bias. Building on this
probabilistic framework, we also investigate the probability that recursive
training on synthetic data yields models that outperform those trained solely
on real data. Moreover, we extend these results to general parametric model
family in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through extensive simulations and a real-world dataset.

Abstract: This paper addresses the covariate shift problem in the context of
nonparametric regression within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).
Covariate shift arises in supervised learning when the input distributions of
the training and test data differ, presenting additional challenges for
learning. Although kernel methods have optimal statistical properties, their
high computational demands in terms of time and, particularly, memory, limit
their scalability to large datasets. To address this limitation, the main focus
of this paper is to explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and
statistical accuracy under covariate shift. We investigate the use of random
projections where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a
given RKHS. Our results show that, even in the presence of covariate shift,
significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising learning
performance.

Abstract: We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature
space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to
maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the
contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various
decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and
recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear
contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing
methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when
we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce
stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret
learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the
number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a
per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret
in terms of $\Delta$.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的灵活性和解释性。

Conclusion: 结合MCTM与NF的方法在保持解释性的同时提升了灵活性。

Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by
modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible
estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in
multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models
is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In
contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as
multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in
flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex
multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with
state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for
modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the
first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account
for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We
demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and
compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.

Method: 基于混合自回归模型推导聚类算法，因计算问题提出小噪声极限版本k-LMVAR，并开发BIC准则选择聚类数和模型阶数。

Result: 算法在模拟中表现优异，计算扩展性好。

Conclusion: k-LMVAR是一种高效且可扩展的向量时间序列聚类方法。

Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping
attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system
modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time
series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality
feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly
ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the
system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by
explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first
derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.
Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then
derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR
(Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable.
We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and
model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and
also scales well computationally.

multivariate binary variables, characterized by a correlation kernel matrix.
This paper proposes a closed form estimator of this kernel, which is
particularly easy to implement and can also be used as a starting value of

Abstract: Bootstrap methods have long been a cornerstone of ensemble learning in
machine learning. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of bootstrap
techniques applied to the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) ensemble
in the context of large and growing sample sizes and feature dimensionalities.
Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we investigate the performance of
this classifier that aggregates decision functions from multiple weak
classifiers, each trained on different subsets of the data. We provide insights
into the use of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional settings, enhancing our
understanding of their impact. Based on these findings, we propose strategies
to select the number of subsets and the regularization parameter that maximize
the performance of the LSSVM. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate our theoretical results.

Motivation: 多角色交互动画（如舞蹈）需要自然交互动作和角色间的协调过渡，现有方法（单角色动画、深度学习或优化方法）无法满足需求。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多角色交互合成中有效，且具有可扩展性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多角色交互动画提供了新的解决方案，解决了数据缺失和过渡规划的挑战。

Abstract: Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and
important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not
only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each
other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing
with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial
and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions
and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous
methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are
critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis
usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.
Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective
functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more
characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two
challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data
and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing
datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense
interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense
interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a
conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character
interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network
for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications
facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.

Conclusion: PTME和坐标合并技术为网格标记化提供了理论支持和实用改进，推动了原生网格生成的发展。

Abstract: The next-coordinate prediction paradigm has emerged as the de facto standard
in current auto-regressive mesh generation methods. Despite their
effectiveness, there is no efficient measurement for the various tokenizers
that serialize meshes into sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new metric
Per-Token-Mesh-Entropy (PTME) to evaluate the existing mesh tokenizers
theoretically without any training. Building upon PTME, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenization technique called coordinate merging. It further
improves the compression ratios of existing tokenizers by rearranging and
merging the most frequent patterns of coordinates. Through experiments on
various tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we
further validate the performance of our method. We hope that the proposed PTME
and coordinate merging can enhance the existing mesh tokenizers and guide the
further development of native mesh generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合聚类和注意力机制的GRU模型（CAGRU），用于预测客户购买意图，解决了客户群体不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注客户未来可能购买的产品类型，而忽视了客户是否会重复购买这一关键因素。客户群体的不平衡分布（大量偶尔购买者和少量忠诚客户）使传统时间序列预测方法受限。

Method: 提出CAGRU模型，首先通过客户特征聚类划分客户群体，然后利用GRU神经网络提取时间序列特征，并引入注意力机制捕捉序列位置的重要性。针对不同客户群体分别训练模型。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验验证了CAGRU方法的优越性。

Conclusion: CAGRU模型能有效解决客户群体不平衡问题，提升购买意图预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting customers' purchase intentions is critical to the
success of a business strategy. Current researches mainly focus on analyzing
the specific types of products that customers are likely to purchase in the
future, little attention has been paid to the critical factor of whether
customers will engage in repurchase behavior. Predicting whether a customer
will make the next purchase is a classic time series forecasting task. However,
in real-world purchasing behavior, customer groups typically exhibit imbalance
- i.e., there are a large number of occasional buyers and a small number of
loyal customers. This head-to-tail distribution makes traditional time series
forecasting methods face certain limitations when dealing with such problems.
To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a unified Clustering and
Attention mechanism GRU model (CAGRU) that leverages multi-modal data for
customer purchase intention prediction. The framework first performs customer
profiling with respect to the customer characteristics and clusters the
customers to delineate the different customer clusters that contain similar
features. Then, the time series features of different customer clusters are
extracted by GRU neural network and an attention mechanism is introduced to
capture the significance of sequence locations. Furthermore, to mitigate the
head-to-tail distribution of customer segments, we train the model separately
for each customer segment, to adapt and capture more accurately the differences
in behavioral characteristics between different customer segments, as well as
the similar characteristics of the customers within the same customer segment.
We constructed four datasets and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed CAGRU approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂科学文档中因固有纠错倾向而掩盖错误的问题，探索无需API或模型修改的实用方法。

Method: 采用PWP原则的结构化上下文调节策略，测试不同提示方法在化学公式验证任务中的表现。

Result: PWP调节显著提升了文本错误识别能力，并帮助Gemini 2.5 Pro发现图像公式错误，而ChatGPT Plus o3未能成功。

Conclusion: PWP调节是一种有前景的实用技术，可增强LLM在科学文档中的错误检测能力，但需进一步验证其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical
documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas
in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs)
whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This
exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context
conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a
methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The
approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available,
general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for
precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat
interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this
methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single,
complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting
strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach
adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset
appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably,
this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle
image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task
where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight
specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and
suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly
accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical
workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in
scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited
PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.

Motivation: 随着金融机构依赖机器学习模型自动化贷款决策，算法公平性问题日益突出。

Method: 通过模拟反映现实贷款模式的合成数据，量化不同公平性干预对利润和违约率的影响。

Result: 结果表明，平等机会约束的利润成本低于人口均等，但忽略受保护属性的方法在公平性和盈利性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究为设计平衡伦理与商业目标的贷款算法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to
automate lending decisions, concerns about algorithmic fairness have risen.
This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such
as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender
profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world
lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact
profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal
opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic
parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model
(fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in
both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific
economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the
feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance
for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with
business objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集因问题过时、污染或泛化，导致结果饱和且信息不足，无法全面比较LLMs的价值差异。

Method: AdAEM通过上下文优化自动生成和扩展测试问题，最大化信息理论目标，提取最新或文化争议话题。

Result: 生成12,310个基于Schwartz价值理论的问题，分析了16个LLMs的价值差异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdAEM能动态追踪LLMs的价值变化，为价值研究提供了更有效的基础。

Abstract: Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)' underlying value differences enables
comprehensive comparison of their misalignment, cultural adaptability, and
biases. Nevertheless, current value measurement datasets face the
informativeness challenge: with often outdated, contaminated, or generic test
questions, they can only capture the shared value orientations among different
LLMs, leading to saturated and thus uninformative results. To address this
problem, we introduce AdAEM, a novel, self-extensible assessment framework for
revealing LLMs' inclinations. Distinct from previous static benchmarks, AdAEM
can automatically and adaptively generate and extend its test questions. This
is achieved by probing the internal value boundaries of a diverse set of LLMs
developed across cultures and time periods in an in-context optimization
manner. The optimization process theoretically maximizes an
information-theoretic objective to extract the latest or culturally
controversial topics, providing more distinguishable and informative insights
about models' value differences. In this way, AdAEM is able to co-evolve with
the development of LLMs, consistently tracking their value dynamics. Using
AdAEM, we generate 12,310 questions grounded in Schwartz Value Theory, conduct
an extensive analysis to manifest our method's validity and effectiveness, and
benchmark the values of 16 LLMs, laying the groundwork for better value
research.

Conclusion: 本文为学者、政策制定者和技术人员提供了工具，以弥合伦理目标与实际操作之间的差距，促进更具包容性和责任感的民主体系。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable
opportunities for democratic governance. This paper introduces a dual taxonomy
to evaluate AI's complex relationship with democracy: the AI Risks to Democracy
(AIRD) taxonomy, which identifies how AI can undermine core democratic
principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive
Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to
enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based
policymaking.
  Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and
particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European
Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned
with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our
analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal
well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning
AI systems with democratic values.
  By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper
offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and
institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides
scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications
of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and
helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing
so, it bridges the gap between ethical aspirations and operational realities,
laying the groundwork for more inclusive, accountable, and resilient democratic
systems in the algorithmic age.

Result: 指出算法本身可以是偏见的来源，例如推荐系统、学术搜索引擎和2020年英国A-level成绩算法。

Conclusion: 认识到算法本身可能具有偏见是解决责任问题和防止算法歧视的关键。

Abstract: Algorithmic bias has been the subject of much recent controversy. To clarify
what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better
understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here
focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To
clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves'
are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further
involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases,
and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts
and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring,
policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been
pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence
media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns,
and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that
algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions
about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated
discrimination.

Conclusion: 比例投票方法更具合法性和公民支持，为民主升级提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use
them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision.
However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to
people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary
scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on
outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well,
while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade
real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods
such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a
proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a
new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland,
we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning
projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference
representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters
who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We
provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional
voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very
technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic
values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism
and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and
long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies.

Abstract: As organizations increasingly rely on AI systems for decision support in
sustainability contexts, it becomes critical to understand the inherent biases
and perspectives embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). This study
systematically investigates how five state-of-the-art LLMs -- Claude, DeepSeek,
GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral - conceptualize sustainability and its relationship
with AI. We administered validated, psychometric sustainability-related
questionnaires - each 100 times per model -- to capture response patterns and
variability. Our findings revealed significant inter-model differences: For
example, GPT exhibited skepticism about the compatibility of AI and
sustainability, whereas LLaMA demonstrated extreme techno-optimism with perfect
scores for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Models also diverged
in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability
integration, a results that holds implications for technology governance
approaches. Our results demonstrate that model selection could substantially
influence organizational sustainability strategies, highlighting the need for
awareness of model-specific biases when deploying LLMs for
sustainability-related decision-making.

Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins
technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error
approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their
emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous
tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly
targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs
synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS)
and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without
requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a
synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm
decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a
simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic
structure, and obtaining both the synthesised material and its reproducible
synthesis protocol on demand may revolutionise materials design. Thus,
ScatterLab provides a generalisable blueprint for autonomous, atomic
structure-targeted synthesis across diverse systems and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核量子效应在有限温度下显著影响材料性质，但传统方法如经验势能或量子力学计算在效率和精度上存在不足。

Method: 开发了一个接口，将MLIP-2软件包中的MTP与i-PI软件包的PIMD结合，用于主动学习势能和研究NQEs对材料性质的影响。

Result: 该方法在锂氢化物（LiH）和硅（Si）系统中表现出高精度，与实验数据和其他计算方法一致。

Conclusion: MTP-PIMD方法在模拟NQEs时兼具高效性和准确性，为材料研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter
material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the
path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such
effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of
interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient
accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but
computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a
solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while
maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate
moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD
calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied
to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on

*Shunjing Zhao,Xian Shi,Hanlun Lei*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ThermoONet的神经网络，用于预测彗星的温度和冰升华通量，显著降低了计算时间并保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的小天体热物理模型数值解计算量大，限制了高分辨率或重复建模的研究。

Method: 采用机器学习方法开发ThermoONet神经网络，预测彗星的温度和冰升华通量。

Result: ThermoONet的平均误差约为2%，计算时间减少了近六个数量级，并成功应用于彗星67P和21P的水活动建模。

Conclusion: ThermoONet在效率和准确性上表现出色，结合全局优化算法还能反演目标天体的物理性质。

Abstract: Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.

Motivation: 尽管情感语音转换（EVC）取得进展，但实现高保真且灵活可控的转换仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出EVC-CLAP模型跨模态对齐情感特征，结合FuEncoder和流匹配模型重构Mel频谱。

Result: 主客观评估验证了ClapFM-EVC的有效性。

Conclusion: ClapFM-EVC在情感语音转换中表现出色，具有灵活性和高质量生成能力。

Abstract: Despite great advances, achieving high-fidelity emotional voice conversion
(EVC) with flexible and interpretable control remains challenging. This paper
introduces ClapFM-EVC, a novel EVC framework capable of generating high-quality
converted speech driven by natural language prompts or reference speech with
adjustable emotion intensity. We first propose EVC-CLAP, an emotional
contrastive language-audio pre-training model, guided by natural language
prompts and categorical labels, to extract and align fine-grained emotional
elements across speech and text modalities. Then, a FuEncoder with an adaptive
intensity gate is presented to seamless fuse emotional features with Phonetic
PosteriorGrams from a pre-trained ASR model. To further improve emotion
expressiveness and speech naturalness, we propose a flow matching model
conditioned on these captured features to reconstruct Mel-spectrogram of source
speech. Subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of
ClapFM-EVC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索分段语音声学特征在检测深度伪造音频中的潜力，因其与人类发音过程密切相关且难以伪造。

Method: 分析分段声学特征在深度伪造音频检测中的表现，并与全局特征对比。

Result: 某些分段特征在检测中有效，而全局特征效果有限。

Conclusion: 音频深度伪造检测需不同于司法语音比对的方法，分段特征提供了新视角。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental
speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable
because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are
expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results
demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice
comparison are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global
features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach
audio deepfake detection differently for forensic voice comparison and offer a
new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora
spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress
in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot,
multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel
dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our
method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized
Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and
linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity.
Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS
significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and
speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the
synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion
task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for
Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale
synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source
evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音数据中缺乏人格标注，人格感知的对话系统研究不足。

Result: 系统在人格预测上与人类判断的一致性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流程和系统为开发人格感知对话系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in neural spoken dialog systems,
personality-aware conversation agents -- capable of adapting behavior based on
personalities -- remain underexplored due to the absence of personality
annotations in speech datasets. We propose a pipeline that preprocesses raw
audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps,
response types, and emotion/sentiment labels. We employ an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system to extract transcripts and timestamps, then generate
conversation-level annotations. Leveraging these annotations, we design a
system that employs large language models to predict conversational
personality. Human evaluators were engaged to identify conversational
characteristics and assign personality labels. Our analysis demonstrates that
the proposed system achieves stronger alignment with human judgments compared
to existing approaches.

Result: 应用于Baichuan-Audio训练过程，验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: S2SBench能有效量化语音LLMs的性能退化，为模型优化提供工具。

Abstract: End-to-end speech large language models ((LLMs)) extend the capabilities of
text-based models to directly process and generate audio tokens. However, this
often leads to a decline in reasoning and generation performance compared to
text input, a phenomenon referred to as intelligence degradation. To
systematically evaluate this gap, we propose S2SBench, a benchmark designed to
quantify performance degradation in Speech LLMs. It includes diagnostic
datasets targeting sentence continuation and commonsense reasoning under audio
input. We further introduce a pairwise evaluation protocol based on perplexity
differences between plausible and implausible samples to measure degradation
relative to text input. We apply S2SBench to analyze the training process of
Baichuan-Audio, which further demonstrates the benchmark's effectiveness. All
datasets and evaluation code are available at

Conclusion: PAST是一个高效的语音表示框架，适用于语音生成任务，并开源了实现。

Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic
information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external
pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained
self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly
integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks.
Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling
real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing
evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including
phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves
superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech
language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for
spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full
implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过学习更适合一阶优化的分数，改进了噪声对比估计（NCE）和切片分数匹配（SSM）在训练能量基模型（EBM）中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NCE和SSM方法在训练EBM时忽略了似然函数的形式，而EBM和扩散模型（DM）在推理中依赖一阶优化，因此需要更适合的分数学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种新准则，通过学习更适合一阶优化方案的分数，改进了NCE和SSM的局限性。

Result: 实验对比了这些方法在训练EBM中的表现。

Conclusion: 新方法通过学习更适合一阶优化的分数，提升了EBM的训练效果。

Abstract: Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for training
energy-based models (EBM) with intractable normalisation terms. The key idea of
NCE is to learn by comparing unnormalised log-likelihoods of the reference and
noisy samples, thus avoiding explicitly computing normalisation terms. However,
NCE critically relies on the quality of noisy samples. Recently, sliced score
matching (SSM) has been popularised by closely related diffusion models (DM).
Unlike NCE, SSM learns a gradient of log-likelihood, or score, by learning
distribution of its projections on randomly chosen directions. However, both
NCE and SSM disregard the form of log-likelihood function, which is problematic
given that EBMs and DMs make use of first-order optimisation during inference.
This paper proposes a new criterion that learns scores more suitable for
first-order schemes. Experiments contrasts these approaches for training EBMs.

Abstract: This paper presents AquaSignal, a modular and scalable pipeline for
preprocessing, denoising, classification, and novelty detection of underwater
acoustic signals. Designed to operate effectively in noisy and dynamic marine
environments, AquaSignal integrates state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures to enhance the reliability and accuracy of acoustic signal
analysis. The system is evaluated on a combined dataset from the Deepship and
Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) benchmarks, providing a diverse set of real-world
underwater scenarios. AquaSignal employs a U-Net architecture for denoising, a
ResNet18 convolutional neural network for classifying known acoustic events,
and an AutoEncoder-based model for unsupervised detection of novel or anomalous
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to apply and
evaluate this combination of techniques on maritime vessel acoustic data.
Experimental results show that AquaSignal improves signal clarity and task
performance, achieving 71% classification accuracy and 91% accuracy in novelty
detection. Despite slightly lower classification performance compared to some
state-of-the-art models, differences in data partitioning strategies limit
direct comparisons. Overall, AquaSignal demonstrates strong potential for
real-time underwater acoustic monitoring in scientific, environmental, and
maritime domains.

Motivation: 解决现有RRAM-based CIM软件项目仅关注单一问题（如编译、模拟或DSE）且依赖传统8位量化的局限性。

Method: 引入CIM-Explorer工具包，包含端到端编译器栈、多种映射选项和模拟器，支持跨不同交叉开关参数和映射的DSE流程。

Result: 在DSE案例研究中展示了不同映射和交叉开关参数的预期准确性。

Conclusion: CIM-Explorer能够支持从早期准确性评估到最终芯片设计的全过程，并已在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Using Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) crossbars in Computing-in-Memory
(CIM) architectures offers a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann
bottleneck. Due to non-idealities like cell variability, RRAM crossbars are
often operated in binary mode, utilizing only two states: Low Resistive State
(LRS) and High Resistive State (HRS). Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and Ternary
Neural Networks (TNNs) are well-suited for this hardware due to their efficient
mapping. Existing software projects for RRAM-based CIM typically focus on only
one aspect: compilation, simulation, or Design Space Exploration (DSE).
Moreover, they often rely on classical 8 bit quantization. To address these
limitations, we introduce CIM-Explorer, a modular toolkit for optimizing BNN
and TNN inference on RRAM crossbars. CIM-Explorer includes an end-to-end
compiler stack, multiple mapping options, and simulators, enabling a DSE flow
for accuracy estimation across different crossbar parameters and mappings.
CIM-Explorer can accompany the entire design process, from early accuracy
estimation for specific crossbar parameters, to selecting an appropriate
mapping, and compiling BNNs and TNNs for a finalized crossbar chip. In DSE case
studies, we demonstrate the expected accuracy for various mappings and crossbar
parameters. CIM-Explorer can be found on GitHub.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非重叠和重叠对话对情绪同步的影响，发现非重叠对话能提供更稳定的情绪协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类在多通道（如面部表情和语音）中表达和同步情绪的方式，对情绪识别系统和人机交互有重要意义。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP数据集，通过EmoNet和Wav2Vec2模型提取情绪数据，分析非重叠和重叠对话中的情绪对齐。

Result: 非重叠对话表现出更稳定和可预测的情绪同步，而重叠对话则显示出更高的变异性。

Conclusion: 对话结构对情绪沟通的调节至关重要，揭示了多模态情感对齐的时空动态。

Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple
communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has
significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer
interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes
clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony,
this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and
temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities.
Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous
emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech
audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional
alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was
associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than
overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically
different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for
arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer,
more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping
speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW
indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination
strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions
more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during
simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of
conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new
insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective
alignment in real world interaction.

Result: DANF能够更精确地表示声场的空间关系，并适应新房间。

Conclusion: DANF为声场建模提供了更精确的方向感知能力，并展示了在新环境中的适应性。

Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the
geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source
and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain
signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields
(NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from
finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on
monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not
precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a
single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more
explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs.
While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners,
we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the
ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank
adaptation.

Conclusion: Llama-SMoP是一种高效且性能强大的多模态LLM，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy
environments by integrating visual cues. While recent advances integrate Large
Language Models (LLMs) into AVSR, their high computational cost hinders
deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose
Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of
Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference
costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors,
Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong
performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR
(Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and
experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation
studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise
robustness.

correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into
intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to
decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a
novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the
relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature
predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG

*Amirbek Djanibekov,Nurdaulet Mukhituly,Kentaro Inui,Hanan Aldarmaki,Nils Lukas*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: SLMs（语音语言模型）在自然交互中更易受对抗攻击，攻击成功率可达100%。研究提出了一种无需重新训练的后修补防御方法，显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音信号比文本更丰富，但也带来新的安全风险，如对抗攻击可能绕过安全机制。

Method: 提出后修补防御方法，通过修改SLM的激活值提升安全性，无需重新训练。

Result: 防御方法将安全性提升至99%，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: 后修补防御有效解决了SLMs的安全漏洞，同时保持了实用性。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken
instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances
in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to
text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by
injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and
find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve
security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during
inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99%
with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We
conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve
the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to
SLMs.

*Jinzuomu Zhong,Suyuan Liu,Dan Wells,Korin Richmond*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语音合成中口音相似性评估的改进方法，提出了主观和客观的评估方法，并揭示了常用指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对生成高保真口音的兴趣增长，但语音合成中的口音相似性评估尚未充分探索。

Method: 主观上改进了XAB听力测试，包括提供转录、标记口音差异和筛选可靠听众；客观上使用了基于元音共振峰和语音后验图的发音相关指标。

Result: 实验表明，这些指标与口音相似性、说话人相似性和Mel倒谱失真等可以结合使用，同时揭示了常用指标（如词错误率）在评估少数口音时的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为口音相似性评估提供了更有效的方法，并指出了现有指标的不足。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in generating high-fidelity accents, evaluating
accent similarity in speech synthesis has been underexplored. We aim to enhance
both subjective and objective evaluation methods for accent similarity.
Subjectively, we refine the XAB listening test by adding components that
achieve higher statistical significance with fewer listeners and lower costs.
Our method involves providing listeners with transcriptions, having them
highlight perceived accent differences, and implementing meticulous screening
for reliability. Objectively, we utilise pronunciation-related metrics, based
on distances between vowel formants and phonetic posteriorgrams, to evaluate
accent generation. Comparative experiments reveal that these metrics, alongside
accent similarity, speaker similarity, and Mel Cepstral Distortion, can be
used. Moreover, our findings underscore significant limitations of common
metrics like Word Error Rate in assessing underrepresented accents.

*Yi-Cheng Lin,Huang-Cheng Chou,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种隐式人口统计推断（IDI）模块，通过伪标签和无监督学习减少语音情感识别（SER）中的偏见，显著提升了公平性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式人口统计标签，但隐私问题使其难以获取，因此需要一种无需显式标签的公平性解决方案。

Method: 结合预训练模型的伪标签和无监督k-means聚类，设计IDI模块以减少SER中的偏见。

Result: 伪标签IDI将公平性指标提升33%以上，SER准确率下降不足3%；无监督IDI提升公平性指标26%以上，SER性能下降不足4%。

Conclusion: IDI模块在缺乏显式人口统计信息时有效减少种族和年龄偏见，展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in
computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit
demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To
address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI)
module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised
learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show
that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness
metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the
unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a
drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the
unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating
its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is
unavailable.

*Chun-Yi Kuan,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出LISTEN方法，通过对比训练增强音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）区分真实与虚构声音的能力，无需修改模型参数，实验证明其高效且有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）在处理音频输入时容易产生虚构声音事件，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出LISTEN方法，利用对比式训练和轻量级适配器，通过合成数据增强模型区分能力。

Result: 实验表明LISTEN有效减少虚构声音，同时在音频问答和推理任务中保持高性能。

Conclusion: LISTEN方法高效且无需修改模型参数，显著提升了音频感知模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them
to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate
non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world
applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that
enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using
synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method
requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio
representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN
effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance
on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is
more efficient in both data and computation.

TL;DR: FlowTSE是一种基于条件流匹配的简单有效的目标说话人提取方法，通过改进相位估计，在标准基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成方法依赖复杂流程和预训练组件，计算开销大，FlowTSE旨在简化流程并提升性能。

Method: 使用条件流匹配，输入为mel谱图和混合语音信号，结合新型声码器改进相位估计。

Result: 在标准TSE基准测试中，FlowTSE表现优于或与现有基线相当。

Conclusion: FlowTSE为生成式目标说话人提取提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a specific speaker's speech
from a mixture using speaker enrollment as a reference. While most existing
approaches are discriminative, recent generative methods for TSE achieve strong
results. However, generative methods for TSE remain underexplored, with most
existing approaches relying on complex pipelines and pretrained components,
leading to computational overhead. In this work, we present FlowTSE, a simple
yet effective TSE approach based on conditional flow matching. Our model
receives an enrollment audio sample and a mixed speech signal, both represented
as mel-spectrograms, with the objective of extracting the target speaker's
clean speech. Furthermore, for tasks where phase reconstruction is crucial, we
propose a novel vocoder conditioned on the complex STFT of the mixed signal,
enabling improved phase estimation. Experimental results on standard TSE
benchmarks show that FlowTSE matches or outperforms strong baselines.

*Jakob Kienegger,Timo Gerkmann*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱引导的说话人提取方法，仅依赖目标的初始位置处理空间动态场景，优于强引导方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标方向已知且静态时表现优异，但在动态场景中因空间特征时变和歧义性而面临挑战。

Method: 结合深度跟踪算法和联合训练策略，使用合成数据集进行训练。

Result: 成功解决空间歧义，性能优于不匹配的强引导方法。

Conclusion: 弱引导方法在动态场景中具有优势，无需依赖精确的时变方向信息。

Abstract: Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering
perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary.
However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to
time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving
speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point
to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical.
Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer
to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction
method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial
dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and
developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the
proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even
outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自监督学习正样本采样技术SSPS，通过聚类和记忆队列选择同说话人但不同录音条件的正样本，显著提升了说话人验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习框架中，同说话人的正样本采样主要依赖同一录音条件下的数据增强，导致模型主要编码录音条件信息而非说话人身份信息，限制了性能。

Method: 提出SSPS技术，利用聚类和记忆队列在潜在空间中选择同说话人但不同录音条件的正样本，应用于SimCLR和DINO框架。

Result: SSPS显著提升了说话人验证性能，SimCLR-SSPS和DINO-SSPS在VoxCeleb1-O上分别达到2.57%和2.53%的EER，优于现有自监督学习方法。

Conclusion: SSPS通过降低说话人内部方差，有效提升了说话人验证性能，为自监督学习在说话人验证中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker
Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling
and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker.
This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel
information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We
propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck:
Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find
an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different
recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a
memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both
SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods
on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by
lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PandaGuard是一个统一的多代理框架，用于系统评估LLM的越狱安全性，包含攻击、防御和判断模块，支持多样化的实验配置和可重复性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估分散且缺乏系统性，难以全面分析越狱攻击和防御的交互效果。

Method: 提出PandaGuard框架，集成19种攻击方法、12种防御机制和多种判断策略，支持模块化插件架构。

Result: 通过PandaBench基准测试49种LLM，发现防御效果因模型和判断策略而异，无单一最优防御方案。

Conclusion: 框架和基准为LLM安全研究提供了透明、可重复的工具，揭示了防御成本和判断一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain
vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety
alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety
research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack
or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this
work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM
jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and
judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms,
along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin
architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and
configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and
practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these
attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches,
requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals
key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs,
and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all
dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety
assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to
support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

TL;DR: MRAG系统通过整合外部多模态数据库增强LMMs，但存在未探索的隐私漏洞。本文首次系统分析了MRAG在视觉-语言和语音-语言模态中的隐私风险，并提出了一种新颖的黑盒攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MRAG系统的隐私漏洞，填补多模态数据隐私风险的研究空白。

Method: 采用黑盒设置下的组合结构化提示攻击，通过操纵查询提取私有信息。

Result: 实验表明，LMMs能直接生成类似检索内容或间接暴露敏感信息的描述。

Conclusion: 亟需开发鲁棒的隐私保护MRAG技术。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems enhance LMMs by
integrating external multimodal databases, but introduce unexplored privacy
vulnerabilities. While text-based RAG privacy risks have been studied,
multimodal data presents unique challenges. We provide the first systematic
analysis of MRAG privacy vulnerabilities across vision-language and
speech-language modalities. Using a novel compositional structured prompt
attack in a black-box setting, we demonstrate how attackers can extract private
information by manipulating queries. Our experiments reveal that LMMs can both
directly generate outputs resembling retrieved content and produce descriptions
that indirectly expose sensitive information, highlighting the urgent need for
robust privacy-preserving MRAG techniques.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了14种流行的开源大语言模型（LLM）在五种攻击基准下的提示注入攻击，提出了攻击成功概率（ASP）指标，并设计了一种简单有效的催眠攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对开源和闭源LLM的提示注入攻击研究不足，且当前指标仅关注成功攻击，忽略了模型响应的不确定性。

Method: 通过分析提示注入攻击的有效性，提出催眠攻击和忽略前缀攻击，并引入ASP指标。

Result: 催眠攻击使对齐模型生成不良行为，ASP达90%；忽略前缀攻击对14种LLM均有效，ASP超60%。

Conclusion: 中等知名度的LLM更易受攻击，需提高公众意识并优先制定缓解策略。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable
to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive
information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for
these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against
the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks.
Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack
Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response,
reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the
effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective
hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models,
including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable
behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore
prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over
$60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known
LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the
need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As computer networks proliferate, the gravity of network intrusions has
escalated, emphasizing the criticality of network intrusion detection systems
for safeguarding security. While deep learning models have exhibited promising
results in intrusion detection, they face challenges in managing
high-dimensional, complex traffic patterns and imbalanced data categories. This
paper presents CSAGC-IDS, a network intrusion detection model based on deep
learning techniques. CSAGC-IDS integrates SC-CGAN, a self-attention-enhanced
convolutional conditional generative adversarial network that generates
high-quality data to mitigate class imbalance. Furthermore, CSAGC-IDS
integrates CSCA-CNN, a convolutional neural network enhanced through cost
sensitive learning and channel attention mechanism, to extract features from
complex traffic data for precise detection. Experiments conducted on the
NSL-KDD dataset. CSAGC-IDS achieves an accuracy of 84.55% and an F1-score of
84.52% in five-class classification task, and an accuracy of 91.09% and an F1
score of 92.04% in binary classification task.Furthermore, this paper provides
an interpretability analysis of the proposed model, using SHAP and LIME to
explain the decision-making mechanisms of the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习系统中，本地客户端可以访问全局模型，存在模型泄露风险。现有水印方法多为不可追踪或白盒可追踪，缺乏黑盒可追踪水印的正式定义和问题描述。

Method: 提出TraMark方法，将模型参数空间分为主任务区域和水印区域，为每个客户端构建个性化全局模型，并在水印区域中学习唯一水印。

Result: 实验表明，TraMark能在保持主任务性能的同时，确保所有水印模型的可追踪性。

Conclusion: TraMark填补了黑盒可追踪水印在联邦学习系统中的空白，有效解决了模型泄露问题。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local
client has access to the global model, posing a critical risk of model leakage.
Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable
intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on
non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a
gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box
watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks
into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting
traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a
novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a
traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model
leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions
the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and
the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is
constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while
preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark
exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset
before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL
systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all
watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.

TL;DR: GDPFed和GDPFed$^+$通过分组客户隐私预算和模型稀疏化，优化联邦学习中的差分隐私保护，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在客户隐私需求异质时因统一严格隐私保护导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: GDPFed按隐私预算分组客户，GDPFed$^+$结合模型稀疏化和优化采样比例。

Result: 实验证明GDPFed$^+$在多个数据集上性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GDPFed$^+$有效平衡隐私保护与模型性能，适用于实际攻击模型。

Abstract: Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a
promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously
protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg
struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must
uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across clients, leading to
excessive DP noise and significant model utility degradation. Existing methods
to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often
assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal
performance and lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we
address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and
the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients
into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within
each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model
utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that
the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the
per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed,
we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate
unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize
convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial
performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出AudioJailbreak，一种针对大型音频语言模型（LALMs）的新型音频越狱攻击，具有异步性、通用性、隐蔽性和空中鲁棒性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本越狱攻击无法直接应用于端到端LALMs，且现有音频越狱攻击在异步性、通用性、隐蔽性和空中鲁棒性方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出AudioJailbreak，通过生成后缀越狱音频、多提示扰动生成、意图隐藏策略和房间脉冲响应模拟实现攻击。

Result: 实验表明AudioJailbreak在多种LALMs上高效，且适用于无法完全操控用户提示的场景。

Conclusion: AudioJailbreak揭示了LALMs的安全隐患，并推动其安全鲁棒性提升。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks to Large audio-language models (LALMs) are studied
recently, but they achieve suboptimal effectiveness, applicability, and
practicability, particularly, assuming that the adversary can fully manipulate
user prompts. In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing
that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end
LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a
novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio
does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal
jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is
effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into
perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak
audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent
concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios
remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the
reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation
of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot
offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.
Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully
manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive
experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of
AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications
of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving
their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available
at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICE的新型黑盒越狱方法，通过意图隐藏和转移绕过安全限制，显著提高了攻击成功率和跨模型泛化能力；同时提出了BiSceneEval数据集，用于评估LLM在问答和文本生成任务中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的安全性问题日益突出，尤其是越狱攻击（jailbreak attacks）通过对抗性提示绕过模型保护机制生成有害内容。现有方法存在查询次数过多和泛化能力差的问题，且评估数据集主要关注问答场景，缺乏对文本生成任务的覆盖。

Method: 提出ICE方法，采用意图隐藏和转移策略，实现单次查询高效攻击；构建BiSceneEval数据集，涵盖问答和文本生成任务，全面评估LLM鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ICE在攻击成功率和跨模型泛化能力上优于现有技术，揭示了当前防御机制的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了结合预定义安全机制和实时语义分解的混合安全策略的必要性，以提升LLM的安全性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements,
their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak
attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful
or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand
security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods
face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2)
poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation
datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to
text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To
tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel
black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to
effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success
rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and
transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive
dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and
text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms
existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current
defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security
strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic
decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.

Result: 在小数据情况下，攻击成功且差分隐私防御无法在不显著损害分类器准确性的情况下抵御攻击。同时，指出传统重建成功率指标不可靠，提出基于Neyman-Pearson引理的新评估方法。

Conclusion: 在训练数据保护至关重要的情况下，使用转移学习的分类器存在显著风险，差分隐私在小数据情况下防御效果有限。

Abstract: Training data reconstruction attacks enable adversaries to recover portions
of a released model's training data. We consider the attacks where a
reconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between
training data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed
adversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data
point can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However,
differential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss
in model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In
this work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the
distribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who
attacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on
this dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model
and demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by
DP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises
significant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when
protection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers
transfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we
point out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate
metric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness.
Instead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver
operating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive
reconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate.

TL;DR: 论文揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）在隐私保护任务中系统性失败，特别是对模糊人名识别能力不足，并提出AMBENCH基准数据集验证这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM隐私解决方案假设模型能可靠检测个人身份信息（PII），但实际存在模糊上下文导致人名被忽视的问题。

Method: 提出AMBENCH数据集，测试LLMs在模糊人名识别任务中的表现，并分析其在隐私保护摘要中的失败率。

Result: 实验显示，模糊人名的召回率比易识别人名低20-40%，且在隐私摘要中被忽略的概率高4倍。

Conclusion: 依赖LLMs保护隐私存在风险，需系统性研究其失败模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to protect sensitive
user data. However, current LLM-based privacy solutions assume that these
models can reliably detect personally identifiable information (PII),
particularly named entities. In this paper, we challenge that assumption by
revealing systematic failures in LLM-based privacy tasks. Specifically, we show
that modern LLMs regularly overlook human names even in short text snippets due
to ambiguous contexts, which cause the names to be misinterpreted or
mishandled. We propose AMBENCH, a benchmark dataset of seemingly ambiguous
human names, leveraging the name regularity bias phenomenon, embedded within
concise text snippets along with benign prompt injections. Our experiments on
modern LLMs tasked to detect PII as well as specialized tools show that recall
of ambiguous names drops by 20--40% compared to more recognizable names.
Furthermore, ambiguous human names are four times more likely to be ignored in
supposedly privacy-preserving summaries generated by LLMs when benign prompt
injections are present. These findings highlight the underexplored risks of
relying solely on LLMs to safeguard user privacy and underscore the need for a
more systematic investigation into their privacy failure modes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gemini在处理用户数据时可能因恶意指令偏离预期，需评估其对抗攻击的能力。

Method: 采用自适应攻击技术的对抗评估框架，持续测试Gemini各版本。

Result: 评估帮助提升Gemini对抗操纵的韧性。

Conclusion: 持续对抗测试是增强Gemini安全性的有效手段。

Abstract: Gemini is increasingly used to perform tasks on behalf of users, where
function-calling and tool-use capabilities enable the model to access user
data. Some tools, however, require access to untrusted data introducing risk.
Adversaries can embed malicious instructions in untrusted data which cause the
model to deviate from the user's expectations and mishandle their data or
permissions. In this report, we set out Google DeepMind's approach to
evaluating the adversarial robustness of Gemini models and describe the main
lessons learned from the process. We test how Gemini performs against a
sophisticated adversary through an adversarial evaluation framework, which
deploys a suite of adaptive attack techniques to run continuously against past,
current, and future versions of Gemini. We describe how these ongoing
evaluations directly help make Gemini more resilient against manipulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种创新的量子机器学习框架，通过可训练的量子可观测量提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习（QML）的发展面临数据编码和参数化量子电路设计的挑战，现有方法忽视了测量过程的优化。

Method: 采用端到端可微分学习框架，动态优化量子可观测量（厄米矩阵）和量子电路参数。

Result: 数值模拟显示，该方法在变分量子电路中动态编程可观测量，分类准确率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了QML模型的性能，为复杂问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum
machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex
challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires
expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption
of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding
strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the
performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often
neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that
may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We
propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum
system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an
end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous
optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized
observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum
observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network,
allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum
circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably,
it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification
accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML
models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子机器学习中数据编码的重要性，研究了不同编码方法及其对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习需要将经典数据转换为量子态，但缺乏选择编码方法的通用规则，因此需要研究不同编码方法的性能。

Method: 研究了多种常用的量子编码方法，并使用不同数据集进行了基准测试。

Result: 不同编码方法对量子机器学习模型的性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 选择合适的量子数据编码方法对提升量子机器学习性能至关重要。

Abstract: Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors,
QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through
encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This
step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert
space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that
may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly
affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the
right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is
generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which
encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a
variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the
most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using
different datasets.

Motivation: 脑机接口系统面临信号变异性、分类效率低和实时适应困难等问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出QSVM-QNN模型，结合QSVM的决策边界能力和QNN的表达学习能力，并在基准EEG数据集上验证。

Result: 模型在两个EEG数据集上分别达到0.990和0.950的高准确率，且在量子噪声环境下表现稳定。

Conclusion: QSVM-QNN为脑机接口和其他生物医学任务提供了可扩展且抗噪声的解决方案。

Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between
the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive
technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI
systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability,
classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in
real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model,
termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with
a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and
robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines
the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power
of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is
evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and
0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To
demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN,
QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit
flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable
performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for
deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed
hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and
time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient
solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.

Motivation: 传统QHD方法仅依赖函数值信息，收敛速度较慢且在高非凸问题中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 通过结合梯度信息改进QHD，提出梯度基QHD方法。

Result: 数值模拟显示梯度基QHD在收敛速度和全局解搜索上优于现有量子与经典方法至少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 梯度基QHD为复杂优化问题提供了更高效的量子算法解决方案。

Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have
emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their
computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection
between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly
within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of
innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm,
Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle
points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in
complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges,
including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and
limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of
quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on
function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by
insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the
acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD
by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based
QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases
the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on
challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms
existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.

Motivation: 探讨AI偏见如何通过推荐影响人类决策，尤其是在招聘场景中，以及反事实解释是否能减轻这种影响。

Method: 通过模拟招聘实验，分阶段测试参与者在无AI、带偏见AI推荐（有无反事实解释）及后续无AI阶段的决策变化。

Result: 参与者70%时间跟随AI推荐，仅少数人发现性别偏见；无解释时决策与偏见一致，有解释时偏见被逆转。

Conclusion: 需校准可解释AI以避免偏见传播，确保公平决策。

Abstract: Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday tasks
improves efficiency and objectivity, it also risks transmitting bias to human
decision-making. In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that
simulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented
with or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over
time. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials
divided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI
recommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final
post-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants
followed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the
given candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected
the gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered
participants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase,
participants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no
counterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when
explanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across
conditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to
male-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty.
Our findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended
behavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent
the adoption of algorithmic bias.

Result: 参与者重视自适应模拟、透明反馈及对AI生成角色的控制，同时指出需平衡个性化与结构化目标。

Conclusion: AI辅助沟通培训需解决自适应与一致性、真实性与偏见等矛盾，以适应不同用户需求。

Abstract: Effective workplace communication is essential for managerial success, yet
many managers lack access to tailored and sustained training. Although
AI-assisted communication systems may offer scalable training solutions, little
is known about how managers envision the role of AI in helping them improve
their communication skills. To investigate this, we designed a conversational
role-play system, CommCoach, as a functional probe to understand how managers
anticipate using AI to practice their communication skills. Through
semi-structured interviews, participants emphasized the value of adaptive,
low-risk simulations for practicing difficult workplace conversations. They
also highlighted opportunities, including human-AI teaming, transparent and
context-aware feedback, and greater control over AI-generated personas.
AI-assisted communication training should balance personalization, structured
learning objectives, and adaptability to different user styles and contexts.
However, achieving this requires carefully navigating tensions between adaptive
and consistent AI feedback, realism and potential bias, and the open-ended
nature of AI conversations versus structured workplace discourse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在主用户（PU）的情况下，次级用户（SU）需要高效利用授权频段并解决能量受限问题，因此需要一种智能的能量收集和传输决策机制。

Method: 采用时间切换方法从PU的干扰和环境中收集能量，并基于DQN动态决定能量收集或数据传输以及传输功率选择。

Result: 该方法优于基线策略，且能够收敛，显著提升了SU的平均数据速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习和能量收集的结合为CRN中的SU提供了高效的能量管理和传输策略。

Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the
performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary
users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed
band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an
energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit
signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two
main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient
radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from
PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The
process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the
time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach,
the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages
during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in
order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline
strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

Conclusion: SAE-FiRE能有效解决财报转录分析中的冗余问题，提升盈利惊喜预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises through the analysis of earnings conference
call transcripts has attracted increasing attention from the financial research
community. Conference calls serve as critical communication channels between
company executives, analysts, and shareholders, offering valuable
forward-looking information. However, these transcripts present significant
analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial
redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for
language models. In this work, we propose the Sparse Autoencoder for Financial
Representation Enhancement (SAE-FiRE) framework to address these limitations by
extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to efficiently identify patterns and filter out
noises, and focusing specifically on capturing nuanced financial signals that
have predictive power for earnings surprises. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed method can significantly outperform comparing baselines.
