### [1] [A Data Synthesis Method Driven by Large Language Models for Proactive Mining of Implicit User Intentions in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11533)
*Jinqiang Wang,Huansheng Ning,Tao Zhu,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出SynPT方法，利用LLM生成旅游领域的高质量对话数据集，解决现有方法在隐式意图挖掘和主动引导用户方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游领域的LLM难以从模糊查询中挖掘隐式用户意图，且缺乏主动引导用户的能力，现有数据集和方法的局限性阻碍了性能提升。

Method: 构建LLM驱动的用户和助手代理，基于中文旅游网站种子数据模拟对话，生成包含显式推理的训练数据集SynPT-Dialog。

Result: 实验表明SynPT优于现有方法，能有效挖掘隐式意图，并分析了关键超参数和实际应用案例。

Conclusion: SynPT解决了旅游领域LLM的局限性，生成高质量数据集并提升模型性能，具备跨语言适应性。

Abstract: In the tourism domain, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to mine
implicit user intentions from tourists' ambiguous inquiries and lack the
capacity to proactively guide users toward clarifying their needs. A critical
bottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate
proactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances
leverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer
specialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from
several shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed
distributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy
in the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking
about tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A
Data Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User
Intentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and
assistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese
tourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and
generates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The
dataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine
implicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human
and LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing
methods. Furthermore, we analyze key hyperparameters and present case studies
to illustrate the practical applicability of our method, including discussions
on its adaptability to English-language scenarios. All code and data are
publicly available.

### [2] [AI-generated Text Detection: A Multifaceted Approach to Binary and Multiclass Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11550)
*Harika Abburi,Sanmitra Bhattacharya,Edward Bowen,Nirmala Pudota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何检测AI生成的文本并识别其来源模型，提出了两种神经网络架构，分别在区分人类与AI文本和模型溯源任务中取得了高F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力可能导致滥用，如生成假新闻或学术作弊，因此需要准确检测AI生成文本及其来源模型。

Method: 针对两项任务（区分人类与AI文本及模型溯源），提出了优化的和简化的神经网络架构。

Result: 在区分任务中，优化模型F1分数为0.994（第五名）；在溯源任务中，简化模型F1分数为0.627（第五名）。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在检测AI生成文本及其来源模型方面表现优异，有助于LLMs的负责任使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating text that closely resembles human writing across a wide range of
styles and genres. However, such capabilities are prone to potential misuse,
such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic
assignments. As a result, accurate detection of AI-generated text and
identification of the model that generated it are crucial for maintaining the
responsible use of LLMs. In this work, we addressed two sub-tasks put forward
by the Defactify workshop under AI-Generated Text Detection shared task at the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025): Task A
involved distinguishing between human-authored or AI-generated text, while Task
B focused on attributing text to its originating language model. For each task,
we proposed two neural architectures: an optimized model and a simpler variant.
For Task A, the optimized neural architecture achieved fifth place with $F1$
score of 0.994, and for Task B, the simpler neural architecture also ranked
fifth place with $F1$ score of 0.627.

### [3] [Assessing Collective Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs via Hidden Profile Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11556)
*Yuxuan Li,Aoi Naito,Hirokazu Shirado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文引入社会心理学中的Hidden Profile范式，用于评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败，发现其表现与人类群体相似但存在细微差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏理论基础的基准来系统评估多智能体LLM系统的集体推理失败，Hidden Profile范式填补了这一空白。

Method: 将Hidden Profile范式形式化为多智能体决策任务，构建包含九项任务的基准，并在GPT-4.1等LLM上进行实验。

Result: 多智能体系统在所有模型中均无法达到完整信息下单个智能体的准确率，表现与人类群体相当但存在行为差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可复现的评估框架，揭示了多智能体LLM系统的合作-矛盾权衡，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving through distributed information integration, but also risk
replicating collective reasoning failures observed in human groups. Yet, no
theory-grounded benchmark exists to systematically evaluate such failures. In
this paper, we introduce the Hidden Profile paradigm from social psychology as
a diagnostic testbed for multi-agent LLM systems. By distributing critical
information asymmetrically across agents, the paradigm reveals how inter-agent
dynamics support or hinder collective reasoning. We first formalize the
paradigm for multi-agent decision-making under distributed knowledge and
instantiate it as a benchmark with nine tasks spanning diverse scenarios,
including adaptations from prior human studies. We then conduct experiments
with GPT-4.1 and five other leading LLMs, including reasoning-enhanced
variants, showing that multi-agent systems across all models fail to match the
accuracy of single agents given complete information. While agents' collective
performance is broadly comparable to that of human groups, nuanced behavioral
differences emerge, such as increased sensitivity to social desirability.
Finally, we demonstrate the paradigm's diagnostic utility by exploring a
cooperation-contradiction trade-off in multi-agent LLM systems. We find that
while cooperative agents are prone to over-coordination in collective settings,
increased contradiction impairs group convergence. This work contributes a
reproducible framework for evaluating multi-agent LLM systems and motivates
future research on artificial collective intelligence and human-AI interaction.

### [4] [Talk to Your Slides: Efficient Slide Editing Agent with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11604)
*Kyudan Jung,Hojun Cho,Jooyeol Yun,Jaehyeok Jang,Jagul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的PPT编辑工具Talk-to-Your-Slides，通过COM通信直接编辑PPT，采用高低两级处理方式，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注PPT生成，而忽略了编辑任务。本文旨在解决这一常见但繁琐的问题。

Method: 系统采用两级处理：高级LLM代理解析指令并制定编辑计划，低级Python脚本直接操作PPT对象。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在执行成功率、指令忠实度和编辑效率上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Talk-to-Your-Slides为PPT编辑提供了灵活且上下文感知的解决方案，并发布了TSBench数据集供评估。

Abstract: Existing research on large language models (LLMs) for PowerPoint
predominantly focuses on slide generation, overlooking the common yet tedious
task of editing existing slides. We introduce Talk-to-Your-Slides, an
LLM-powered agent that directly edits slides within active PowerPoint sessions
through COM communication. Our system employs a two-level approach: (1)
high-level processing where an LLM agent interprets instructions and formulates
editing plans, and (2) low-level execution where Python scripts directly
manipulate PowerPoint objects. Unlike previous methods relying on predefined
operations, our approach enables more flexible and contextually-aware editing.
To facilitate evaluation, we present TSBench, a human-annotated dataset of 379
diverse editing instructions with corresponding slide variations. Experimental
results demonstrate that Talk-to-Your-Slides significantly outperforms baseline
methods in execution success rate, instruction fidelity, and editing
efficiency. Our code and benchmark are available at

### [5] [MedGUIDE: Benchmarking Clinical Decision-Making in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11613)
*Xiaomin Li,Mingye Gao,Yuexing Hao,Taoran Li,Guangya Wan,Zihan Wang,Yijun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedGUIDE是一个新基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在遵循临床指南决策方面的能力，发现即使是专业模型也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM是否能可靠地遵循结构化临床指南，以确保其在医疗决策中的安全性和准确性。

Method: 基于55个NCCN决策树构建MedGUIDE基准，通过两阶段质量选择过程筛选7,747个高质量样本，评估25种LLM的表现。

Result: 发现即使是专业LLM在结构化指南遵循任务中表现不佳，尝试通过上下文指南包含或继续预训练改进效果有限。

Conclusion: MedGUIDE对评估LLM在真实临床环境中的安全操作至关重要。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines, typically structured as decision trees, are central to
evidence-based medical practice and critical for ensuring safe and accurate
diagnostic decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether Large Language
Models (LLMs) can reliably follow such structured protocols. In this work, we
introduce MedGUIDE, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on their ability to
make guideline-consistent clinical decisions. MedGUIDE is constructed from 55
curated NCCN decision trees across 17 cancer types and uses clinical scenarios
generated by LLMs to create a large pool of multiple-choice diagnostic
questions. We apply a two-stage quality selection process, combining
expert-labeled reward models and LLM-as-a-judge ensembles across ten clinical
and linguistic criteria, to select 7,747 high-quality samples. We evaluate 25
LLMs spanning general-purpose, open-source, and medically specialized models,
and find that even domain-specific LLMs often underperform on tasks requiring
structured guideline adherence. We also test whether performance can be
improved via in-context guideline inclusion or continued pretraining. Our
findings underscore the importance of MedGUIDE in assessing whether LLMs can
operate safely within the procedural frameworks expected in real-world clinical
settings.

### [6] [Steering Risk Preferences in Large Language Models by Aligning Behavioral and Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11615)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Haijiang Yan,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过构建“转向向量”直接编辑Transformer残差流，无需重新训练或微调即可有效改变大语言模型行为。提出一种系统性识别转向向量的方法，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在不重新训练或微调模型的情况下，通过编辑内部神经激活（转向向量）来定向影响大语言模型的行为。

Method: 提出一种系统性方法，通过行为方法（如马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛）与神经表征对齐来识别转向向量，并以风险偏好为例验证。

Result: 实验表明，生成的转向向量能可靠地按目标行为调整模型输出。

Conclusion: 转向向量是一种有效且定向的方法，可用于改变大语言模型行为，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as
straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using
appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal
neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective
and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or
fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically
identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by
aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods
(specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural
counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk
preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned
representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering
vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the
targeted behavior.

### [7] [THELMA: Task Based Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Model Applications-RAG Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11626)
*Udita Patel,Rutu Mulkar,Jay Roberts,Cibi Chakravarthy Senthilkumar,Sujay Gandhi,Xiaofei Zheng,Naumaan Nayyar,Rafael Castrillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: THELMA是一个无参考框架，用于评估RAG QA应用，包含六个相互依赖的指标，支持端到端评估和改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为RAG QA应用提供无需标注数据或参考响应的全面评估方法。

Method: 设计六个相互依赖的指标，用于细粒度评估RAG QA应用。

Result: THELMA可帮助识别需要改进的RAG组件。

Conclusion: THELMA为RAG QA应用提供了一种有效的评估和改进工具。

Abstract: We propose THELMA (Task Based Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Model
Applications), a reference free framework for RAG (Retrieval Augmented
generation) based question answering (QA) applications. THELMA consist of six
interdependent metrics specifically designed for holistic, fine grained
evaluation of RAG QA applications. THELMA framework helps developers and
application owners evaluate, monitor and improve end to end RAG QA pipelines
without requiring labelled sources or reference responses.We also present our
findings on the interplay of the proposed THELMA metrics, which can be
interpreted to identify the specific RAG component needing improvement in QA
applications.

### [8] [Critique-Guided Distillation: Improving Supervised Fine-tuning via Better Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11628)
*Berkcan Kapusuzoglu,Supriyo Chakraborty,Chia-Hsuan Lee,Sambit Sahu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CGD的新方法，通过结合教师模型的解释性批评和优化响应，改进监督微调（SFT）中的模仿问题，显著提升了数学和语言理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调（SFT）存在模仿问题，模型仅复制正确响应而缺乏对背后逻辑的理解。

Method: 提出CGD框架，利用教师模型生成的解释性批评和优化响应，训练学生模型学习“模仿什么”和“为什么模仿”。

Result: 在数学（AMC23 +17.5%）和语言理解（MMLU-Pro +6.3%）任务上表现显著提升，并解决了格式漂移问题。

Conclusion: CGD通过引入解释性批评和优化响应，有效解决了SFT的模仿问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using expert demonstrations often suffer from
the imitation problem, where the model learns to reproduce the correct
responses without \emph{understanding} the underlying rationale. To address
this limitation, we propose \textsc{Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD)}, a
novel multi-stage framework that integrates teacher model generated
\emph{explanatory critiques} and \emph{refined responses} into the SFT process.
A student model is then trained to map the triplet of prompt, teacher critique,
and its own initial response to the corresponding refined teacher response,
thereby learning both \emph{what} to imitate and \emph{why}. Using
entropy-based analysis, we show that \textsc{CGD} reduces refinement
uncertainty and can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior update. We perform
extensive empirical evaluation of \textsc{CGD}, on variety of benchmark tasks,
and demonstrate significant gains on both math (AMC23 +17.5%) and language
understanding tasks (MMLU-Pro +6.3%), while successfully mitigating the format
drift issues observed in previous critique fine-tuning (CFT) techniques.

### [9] [Can an Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Make Reasoning Emerge in Small Language Models? Evidence from a Four-Stage Curriculum on GPT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11643)
*Xiang Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发有序课程显著提升小语言模型的推理透明度和样本效率，Cognivolve模型通过四阶段训练实现目标精度，但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开发有序课程对小语言模型推理能力和效率的影响。

Method: 训练124M参数的GPT-2模型Cognivolve，采用四阶段课程（从词汇匹配到多步符号推理），无需任务特定微调。

Result: Cognivolve在优化步骤减半的情况下达到目标精度，激活更多推理头，注意力熵更高。

Conclusion: 课程顺序是关键，但最终答案成功率仍有差距，需进一步研究混合阶段微调和探测扩展。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a developmentally ordered curriculum markedly improves
reasoning transparency and sample-efficiency in small language models (SLMs).
Concretely, we train Cognivolve, a 124 M-parameter GPT-2 model, on a four-stage
syllabus that ascends from lexical matching to multi-step symbolic inference
and then evaluate it without any task-specific fine-tuning. Cognivolve reaches
target accuracy in half the optimization steps of a single-phase baseline,
activates an order-of-magnitude more gradient-salient reasoning heads, and
shifts those heads toward deeper layers, yielding higher-entropy attention that
balances local and long-range context. The same curriculum applied out of order
or with optimizer resets fails to reproduce these gains, confirming that
progression--not extra compute--drives the effect. We also identify open
challenges: final-answer success still lags a conventional run by about 30%,
and our saliency probe under-detects verbal-knowledge heads in the hardest
stage, suggesting directions for mixed-stage fine-tuning and probe expansion.

### [10] [Multilingual Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: A Survey Across NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11665)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在NLP任务中表现优异，但其在多语言环境中的有效性仍面临挑战。多语言提示工程提供了一种无需重新训练或微调的方法，以增强LLMs的多语言能力。

Method: 通过结构化自然语言提示，研究者从LLMs中提取跨语言知识，并分类了39种提示技术，应用于30种多语言NLP任务。

Result: 研究覆盖约250种语言，分析了语言家族和资源水平（高资源与低资源）对任务分布和提示方法频率的影响。

Conclusion: 多语言提示工程为广泛用户提供了利用LLMs能力的途径，并展示了在多语言任务中的潜在最优方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, ensuring
their effectiveness across multiple languages presents unique challenges.
Multilingual prompt engineering has emerged as a key approach to enhance LLMs'
capabilities in diverse linguistic settings without requiring extensive
parameter re-training or fine-tuning. With growing interest in multilingual
prompt engineering over the past two to three years, researchers have explored
various strategies to improve LLMs' performance across languages and NLP tasks.
By crafting structured natural language prompts, researchers have successfully
extracted knowledge from LLMs across different languages, making these
techniques an accessible pathway for a broader audience, including those
without deep expertise in machine learning, to harness the capabilities of
LLMs. In this paper, we survey and categorize different multilingual prompting
techniques based on the NLP tasks they address across a diverse set of datasets
that collectively span around 250 languages. We further highlight the LLMs
employed, present a taxonomy of approaches and discuss potential
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods for specific multilingual datasets.
Additionally, we derive a range of insights across language families and
resource levels (high-resource vs. low-resource), including analyses such as
the distribution of NLP tasks by language resource type and the frequency of
prompting methods across different language families. Our survey reviews 36
research papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP
tasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.

### [11] [Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679)
*Zhibo Hu,Chen Wang,Yanfeng Shu,Hye-Young Paik,Liming Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过分析潜在空间中模糊文本的表示差异来识别模糊性，并利用路径核设计新的距离测量方法，以提高LLMs在模糊任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中的模糊性是LLMs在文本到结构化数据映射中的主要障碍，现有方法（如ReACT框架或监督微调）未能有效解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析模糊问题与其解释之间的关系，利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）的梯度路径核设计新的距离测量方法，识别模糊性。

Result: 提出了一个基于缺失概念预测的新框架，显著提高了LLMs在模糊任务（如工具调用）中的性能。

Conclusion: 新方法通过潜在空间分析和路径核测量，有效解决了LLMs在模糊文本映射中的问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving
accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs),
which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool
calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods of ambiguity handling either
exploit ReACT framework to produce the correct mapping through trial and error,
or supervised fine tuning to guide models to produce a biased mapping to
improve certain tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that
characterizes the representation difference of ambiguous text in the latent
space and leverage the difference to identify ambiguity before mapping them to
structured data. To detect ambiguity of a sentence, we focused on the
relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations and what
cause the LLM ignore multiple interpretations. Different to the distance
calculated by dense embedding vectors, we utilize the observation that
ambiguity is caused by concept missing in latent space of LLM to design a new
distance measurement, computed through the path kernel by the integral of
gradient values for each concepts from sparse-autoencoder (SAE) under each
state. We identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous questions with this
measurement. Based on our observation, We propose a new framework to improve
the performance of LLMs on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing
concepts prediction.

### [12] [Evaluating Design Decisions for Dual Encoder-based Entity Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11683)
*Susanna Rücker,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了VerbalizED模型，通过评估双编码器的关键设计决策（如损失函数、相似度度量等），结合上下文标签和高效负采样，实现了在ZELDA基准上的新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双编码器在实体消歧任务中的关键设计决策，以提升性能。

Method: 提出VerbalizED模型，采用双编码器架构，结合上下文标签和高效负采样策略，并探索迭代预测变体。

Result: 在AIDA-Yago数据集上验证了模型有效性，并在ZELDA基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: VerbalizED模型通过优化设计决策，显著提升了实体消歧任务的性能。

Abstract: Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of linking mentions in text to
corresponding entries in a knowledge base. Dual Encoders address this by
embedding mentions and label candidates in a shared embedding space and
applying a similarity metric to predict the correct label. In this work, we
focus on evaluating key design decisions for Dual Encoder-based ED, such as its
loss function, similarity metric, label verbalization format, and negative
sampling strategy. We present the resulting model VerbalizED, a document-level
Dual Encoder model that includes contextual label verbalizations and efficient
hard negative sampling. Additionally, we explore an iterative prediction
variant that aims to improve the disambiguation of challenging data points.
Comprehensive experiments on AIDA-Yago validate the effectiveness of our
approach, offering insights into impactful design choices that result in a new
State-of-the-Art system on the ZELDA benchmark.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非洲低资源语言在自动语音识别（ASR）技术中的挑战，提出了社区驱动数据收集、轻量模型等解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非洲低资源语言在ASR技术中的代表性不足问题，推动其发展与应用。

Method: 分析数据稀缺、语言复杂性等挑战，提出社区驱动数据收集、自监督学习等策略。

Result: 案例研究表明定制化解决方案可行，如基于语素的建模和领域特定ASR应用。

Conclusion: 需跨学科合作和持续投资，以开发高效、包容的ASR系统，促进非洲语言多样性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have transformed
human-computer interaction; however, low-resource languages in Africa remain
significantly underrepresented in both research and practical applications.
This study investigates the major challenges hindering the development of ASR
systems for these languages, which include data scarcity, linguistic
complexity, limited computational resources, acoustic variability, and ethical
concerns surrounding bias and privacy. The primary goal is to critically
analyze these barriers and identify practical, inclusive strategies to advance
ASR technologies within the African context. Recent advances and case studies
emphasize promising strategies such as community-driven data collection,
self-supervised and multilingual learning, lightweight model architectures, and
techniques that prioritize privacy. Evidence from pilot projects involving
various African languages showcases the feasibility and impact of customized
solutions, which encompass morpheme-based modeling and domain-specific ASR
applications in sectors like healthcare and education. The findings highlight
the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained investment to
tackle the distinct linguistic and infrastructural challenges faced by the
continent. This study offers a progressive roadmap for creating ethical,
efficient, and inclusive ASR systems that not only safeguard linguistic
diversity but also improve digital accessibility and promote socioeconomic
participation for speakers of African languages.

*Ana Ezquerro,David Vilares,Anssi Yli-Jyrä,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分层括号概念的序列标注依赖解析编码家族，证明了现有4位投影编码属于该家族但标签数量非最优，并推导出仅需12个标签的最优分层括号编码，同时扩展到非投影树，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有依赖解析编码的标签效率，支持更紧凑的非投影树表示。

Method: 基于分层括号概念，推导最优编码，减少标签数量，并扩展到非投影树。

Result: 最优编码仅需12个标签（原16个），非投影树表示更紧凑，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新编码在标签效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于多种树库。

Abstract: We present a family of encodings for sequence labeling dependency parsing,
based on the concept of hierarchical bracketing. We prove that the existing
4-bit projective encoding belongs to this family, but it is suboptimal in the
number of labels used to encode a tree. We derive an optimal hierarchical
bracketing, which minimizes the number of symbols used and encodes projective
trees using only 12 distinct labels (vs. 16 for the 4-bit encoding). We also
extend optimal hierarchical bracketing to support arbitrary non-projectivity in
a more compact way than previous encodings. Our new encodings yield competitive
accuracy on a diverse set of treebanks.

Abstract: Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to
understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects.
Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task.
In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual
and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within
dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses.
This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference
resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting
mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that
learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and
predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in
multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference
resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative
models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates
that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence
scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which
can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MedCaseReasoning数据集，用于评估LLMs在医疗诊断中的推理能力，发现现有模型表现不足，但通过微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗基准（如MedQA和MMLU）仅关注最终答案的准确性，忽视了临床推理过程的质量和忠实性，因此需要新的评估方法。

Method: 提出MedCaseReasoning数据集，包含14,489个诊断案例及其详细推理说明，用于评估LLMs的诊断和推理能力，并通过微调模型验证改进效果。

Result: 现有LLMs表现不佳（如DeepSeek-R1诊断准确率仅48%），但微调后诊断准确率和推理召回率分别提升29%和41%。

Conclusion: MedCaseReasoning填补了医疗推理评估的空白，微调LLMs可显著提升其临床诊断和推理能力。

Abstract: Doctors and patients alike increasingly use Large Language Models (LLMs) to
diagnose clinical cases. However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where
correctness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis
requires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently,
widely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the
final answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical
reasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning,
the first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align
with clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489
diagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning
statements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate
state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant
shortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing
open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy
and mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However,
we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from
MedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical
reasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The
open-source dataset, code, and models are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的LLM优化方法ZeroTuning，通过调整初始空语义令牌的注意力分布来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助机制识别任务相关令牌，可能引入偏差且适用性有限。研究发现初始空语义令牌是一个未被充分探索的控制点。

Method: 通过理论分析发现初始令牌的注意力调整能优化后续令牌分布，提出ZeroTuning方法，针对该令牌进行头部特异性注意力调整。

Result: ZeroTuning在文本分类、问答等任务中显著提升性能（如Llama-3.1-8B分类任务提升11.71%），且具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 初始空语义令牌是LLM中一个有效的控制点，为推理时优化和模型可解释性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recently, training-free methods for improving large language models (LLMs)
have attracted growing interest, with token-level attention tuning emerging as
a promising and interpretable direction. However, existing methods typically
rely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific
tokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,
we uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial
token is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model
behavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's
attention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent
tokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,
we find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more
effectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a
consistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but
varies across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct
preferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we
propose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by
applying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite
tuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text
classification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across
models such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek. For example, ZeroTuning improves
Llama-3.1-8B by 11.71% on classification, 2.64% on QA tasks, and raises its
multi-turn score from 7.804 to 7.966. The method is also robust to limited
resources, few-shot settings, long contexts, quantization, decoding strategies,
and prompt variations. Our work sheds light on a previously overlooked control
point in LLMs, offering new insights into both inference-time tuning and model
interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机掩码输入标记的简单正则化方法，通过引入随机扰动增强模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索掩码输入标记是否能进一步提升基于Transformer的模型在文本分类任务中的表现。

Method: 提出了一种名为“标记掩码正则化”的方法，随机以概率p将输入标记替换为特殊[MASK]标记，通过随机扰动实现隐式梯度平均。

Result: 在语言识别和情感分析任务中，该方法在多种模型上表现优于标准正则化技术，最佳掩码率p=0.1。

Conclusion: 掩码正则化通过减少过拟合和隐式集成效应显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: While transformer-based models achieve strong performance on text
classification, we explore whether masking input tokens can further enhance
their effectiveness. We propose token masking regularization, a simple yet
theoretically motivated method that randomly replaces input tokens with a
special [MASK] token at probability p. This introduces stochastic perturbations
during training, leading to implicit gradient averaging that encourages the
model to capture deeper inter-token dependencies. Experiments on language
identification and sentiment analysis -- across diverse models (mBERT,
Qwen2.5-0.5B, TinyLlama-1.1B) -- show consistent improvements over standard
regularization techniques. We identify task-specific optimal masking rates,
with p = 0.1 as a strong general default. We attribute the gains to two key
effects: (1) input perturbation reduces overfitting, and (2) gradient-level
smoothing acts as implicit ensembling.

Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question
answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted
with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant
information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information
sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the
causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In
this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting
search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study
reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the
ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in
MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order
of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned
decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order
aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models
with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively
boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough
investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of
MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher
values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to
heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/hwy9855/MultiHopQA-Reasoning.

Result: 1B和8B模型在生成准确、可跨语言翻译的释义上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: LLMs为通用语义表征开辟新途径，适用于语义分析和翻译等领域。

Abstract: The Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on a
universal set of semantic primes: simple, primitive word-meanings that have
been shown to exist in most, if not all, languages of the world. According to
this framework, any word, regardless of complexity, can be paraphrased using
these primes, revealing a clear and universally translatable meaning. These
paraphrases, known as explications, can offer valuable applications for many
natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but producing them has traditionally
been a slow, manual process. In this work, we present the first study of using
large language models (LLMs) to generate NSM explications. We introduce
automatic evaluation methods, a tailored dataset for training and evaluation,
and fine-tuned models for this task. Our 1B and 8B models outperform GPT-4o in
producing accurate, cross-translatable explications, marking a significant step
toward universal semantic representation with LLMs and opening up new
possibilities for applications in semantic analysis, translation, and beyond.

Conclusion: Retrospex通过有效利用过往经验和动态调整机制，显著提升了LLM智能体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge and commonsense
reasoning capabilities, making them valuable for creating powerful agents.
However, existing LLM agent frameworks have not fully utilized past experiences
for improvement. This work introduces a new LLM-based agent framework called
Retrospex, which addresses this challenge by analyzing past experiences in
depth. Unlike previous approaches, Retrospex does not directly integrate
experiences into the LLM's context. Instead, it combines the LLM's action
likelihood with action values estimated by a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Critic, which is trained on past experiences through an offline
''retrospection'' process. Additionally, Retrospex employs a dynamic action
rescoring mechanism that increases the importance of experience-based values
for tasks that require more interaction with the environment. We evaluate
Retrospex in ScienceWorld, ALFWorld and Webshop environments, demonstrating its
advantages over strong, contemporary baselines.

Abstract: General-purpose large language models demonstrate notable capabilities in
language comprehension and generation, achieving results that are comparable
to, or even surpass, human performance in many language information processing
tasks. Nevertheless, when general models are applied to some specific domains,
e.g., Classical Chinese texts, their effectiveness is often unsatisfactory, and
fine-tuning open-source foundational models similarly struggles to adequately
incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To address this challenge, this study
developed a large language model, AI Taiyan, specifically designed for
understanding and generating Classical Chinese. Experiments show that with a
reasonable model design, data processing, foundational training, and
fine-tuning, satisfactory results can be achieved with only 1.8 billion
parameters. In key tasks related to Classical Chinese information processing
such as punctuation, identification of allusions, explanation of word meanings,
and translation between ancient and modern Chinese, this model exhibits a clear
advantage over both general-purpose large models and domain-specific
traditional models, achieving levels close to or surpassing human baselines.
This research provides a reference for the efficient construction of
specialized domain-specific large language models. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the application of this model in fields such as the collation of
ancient texts, dictionary editing, and language research, combined with case
studies.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages
and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous
works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling
perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question
types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop
QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types
of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,
Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of
multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of
methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to
address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between
question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an
''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes
multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined
''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the
debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative
debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow
debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines
in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher
cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA
scenarios.

Conclusion: CoM为语言模型构建提供了新的方向，支持渐进式扩展和多尺寸模型弹性推理。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm, termed Chain-of-Model
(CoM), which incorporates the causal relationship into the hidden states of
each layer as a chain style, thereby introducing great scaling efficiency in
model training and inference flexibility in deployment. We introduce the
concept of Chain-of-Representation (CoR), which formulates the hidden states at
each layer as a combination of multiple sub-representations (i.e., chains) at
the hidden dimension level. In each layer, each chain from the output
representations can only view all of its preceding chains in the input
representations. Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can
progressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the
previous models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes
for elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this
principle, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the
idea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we
further introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes
all keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.
This design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM
switching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate
our CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,
while simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling
to improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for
elastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models. Our code
will be released in the future at: https://github.com/microsoft/CoLM.

Conclusion: Long⊗Short框架通过区分思维重要性，显著提升了推理效率，为LLM的高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Compressing long chain-of-thought (CoT) from large language models (LLMs) is
an emerging strategy to improve the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. Despite its
promising benefits, existing studies equally compress all thoughts within a
long CoT, hindering more concise and effective reasoning. To this end, we first
investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their
effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic
long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we
propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an
efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve
the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important
thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining
thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start
data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles,
respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn
reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration
between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our
method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance
compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while
reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and

Abstract: Detecting deviant language such as sexism, or nuanced language such as
metaphors or sarcasm, is crucial for enhancing the safety, clarity, and
interpretation of online social discourse. While existing classifiers deliver
strong results on these tasks, they often come with significant computational
cost and high data demands. In this work, we propose \textbf{Cla}ss
\textbf{D}istillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core
challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse
and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss
function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on
Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized
for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks -- sexism,
metaphor, and sarcasm -- ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with
smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves
performance comparable to several large language models (LLMs). These results
demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding
tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous
background.

Abstract: The robustness and security of large language models (LLMs) has become a
prominent research area. One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM
safeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented
languages, a simple yet effective method of "jailbreaking" these models.
Despite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the
safeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to
enhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation
between various attack features across different languages and propose
Multilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that
optimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate
multilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages:
First, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple
languages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while
minimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety
misalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the
effectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly
used jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess
various safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in
underrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability
of MCD. The results demonstrate that MCD outperforms existing approaches in
safeguarding against multilingual jailbreak attempts while also exhibiting
strong language transfer capabilities. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled the vision of
automated scientific discovery, often called AI Co-Scientists. To date, prior
work casts these systems as generative co-authors responsible for crafting
hypotheses, synthesizing code, or drafting manuscripts. In this work, we
explore a complementary application: using LLMs as verifiers to automate the
\textbf{academic verification of scientific manuscripts}. To that end, we
introduce SPOT, a dataset of 83 published papers paired with 91 errors
significant enough to prompt errata or retraction, cross-validated with actual
authors and human annotators. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on SPOT, we find
that none surpasses 21.1\% recall or 6.1\% precision (o3 achieves the best
scores, with all others near zero). Furthermore, confidence estimates are
uniformly low, and across eight independent runs, models rarely rediscover the
same errors, undermining their reliability. Finally, qualitative analysis with
domain experts reveals that even the strongest models make mistakes resembling
student-level misconceptions derived from misunderstandings. These findings
highlight the substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and the
requirements for dependable AI-assisted academic verification.

TL;DR: NAMET是一种通过引入噪声改进大规模知识编辑的方法，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法在大规模编辑场景下效果不佳，主要由于知识项之间的嵌入冲突。

Method: 提出NAMET，通过在内存提取中引入噪声，仅需对MEMIT进行一行修改。

Result: 在六个LLM和三个数据集上的实验表明，NAMET在编辑数千条事实时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NAMET是一种简单有效的大规模知识编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in
large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches
degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with
practical metrics or in context-rich settings. We attribute these failures to
embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability
at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in
Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during
memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments
across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that NAMET consistently
outperforms existing methods when editing thousands of facts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如F1和ROUGE）忽视医学术语的重要性，而人工评估成本高且可能不准确。现有基于LLM的评估方法在医学领域适用性有限。

Method: 提出AutoMedEval，采用13B参数的模型，通过分层训练方法（课程指令调整和迭代知识内省机制）提升医学评估能力。

Result: AutoMedEval在相关性上优于其他基线模型，更接近人工评估结果。

Conclusion: AutoMedEval为医学LLM评估提供了一种高效且可靠的自动解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain,
there is increasing demand for improved evaluation techniques to assess their
capabilities. However, traditional metrics like F1 and ROUGE, which rely on
token overlaps to measure quality, significantly overlook the importance of
medical terminology. While human evaluation tends to be more reliable, it can
be very costly and may as well suffer from inaccuracies due to limits in human
expertise and motivation. Although there are some evaluation methods based on
LLMs, their usability in the medical field is limited due to their proprietary
nature or lack of expertise. To tackle these challenges, we present
AutoMedEval, an open-sourced automatic evaluation model with 13B parameters
specifically engineered to measure the question-answering proficiency of
medical LLMs. The overarching objective of AutoMedEval is to assess the quality
of responses produced by diverse models, aspiring to significantly reduce the
dependence on human evaluation. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
training method involving curriculum instruction tuning and an iterative
knowledge introspection mechanism, enabling AutoMedEval to acquire professional
medical assessment capabilities with limited instructional data. Human
evaluations indicate that AutoMedEval surpasses other baselines in terms of
correlation with human judgments.

Result: 评估了AppAgent-v1、Mobile-Agent-v2等代理，验证了基准的全面性和实用性。

Conclusion: Mobile-Bench-v2为移动代理提供了更真实、全面的评估标准，解决了现有基准的局限性。

Abstract: VLM-based mobile agents are increasingly popular due to their capabilities to
interact with smartphone GUIs and XML-structured texts and to complete daily
tasks. However, existing online benchmarks struggle with obtaining stable
reward signals due to dynamic environmental changes. Offline benchmarks
evaluate the agents through single-path trajectories, which stands in contrast
to the inherently multi-solution characteristics of GUI tasks. Additionally,
both types of benchmarks fail to assess whether mobile agents can handle noise
or engage in proactive interactions due to a lack of noisy apps or overly full
instructions during the evaluation process. To address these limitations, we
use a slot-based instruction generation method to construct a more realistic
and comprehensive benchmark named Mobile-Bench-v2. Mobile-Bench-v2 includes a
common task split, with offline multi-path evaluation to assess the agent's
ability to obtain step rewards during task execution. It contains a noisy split
based on pop-ups and ads apps, and a contaminated split named AITZ-Noise to
formulate a real noisy environment. Furthermore, an ambiguous instruction split
with preset Q\&A interactions is released to evaluate the agent's proactive
interaction capabilities. We conduct evaluations on these splits using the
single-agent framework AppAgent-v1, the multi-agent framework Mobile-Agent-v2,
as well as other mobile agents such as UI-Tars and OS-Atlas. Code and data are
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/xwk123/MobileBench-v2.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应规划框架（RLAP），用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）在多步自然语言处理（NLP）任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多步NLP任务中忽视了实例的语言特征，仅依赖LLM的固有规划能力，导致结果不理想。

Method: 将NLP任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），通过强化学习训练轻量级Actor模型估计自然语言序列的Q值，动态确定子任务顺序。

Result: 在三种不同类型的NLP任务上验证了RLAP的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RLAP通过结合语言特征和强化学习，显著提升了多步NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-step planning has been widely employed to enhance the performance of
large language models (LLMs) on downstream natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, which decomposes the original task into multiple subtasks and guide LLMs
to solve them sequentially without additional training. When addressing task
instances, existing methods either preset the order of steps or attempt
multiple paths at each step. However, these methods overlook instances'
linguistic features and rely on the intrinsic planning capabilities of LLMs to
evaluate intermediate feedback and then select subtasks, resulting in
suboptimal outcomes. To better solve multi-step NLP tasks with LLMs, in this
paper we propose a Reinforcement Learning enhanced Adaptive Planning framework
(RLAP). In our framework, we model an NLP task as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and employ an LLM directly into the environment. In particular, a
lightweight Actor model is trained to estimate Q-values for natural language
sequences consisting of states and actions through reinforcement learning.
Therefore, during sequential planning, the linguistic features of each sequence
in the MDP can be taken into account, and the Actor model interacts with the
LLM to determine the optimal order of subtasks for each task instance. We apply
RLAP on three different types of NLP tasks and conduct extensive experiments on
multiple datasets to verify RLAP's effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: ReQAP为混合数据源的问答提供了一种高效且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Question answering over mixed sources, like text and tables, has been
advanced by verbalizing all contents and encoding it with a language model. A
prominent case of such heterogeneous data is personal information: user devices
log vast amounts of data every day, such as calendar entries, workout
statistics, shopping records, streaming history, and more. Information needs
range from simple look-ups to queries of analytical nature. The challenge is to
provide humans with convenient access with small footprint, so that all
personal data stays on the user devices. We present ReQAP, a novel method that
creates an executable operator tree for a given question, via recursive
decomposition. Operators are designed to enable seamless integration of
structured and unstructured sources, and the execution of the operator tree
yields a traceable answer. We further release the PerQA benchmark, with
persona-based data and questions, covering a diverse spectrum of realistic user
needs.

Motivation: 解决现有RAG系统依赖嵌入检索导致的语义相似但意图不匹配问题，以及图/层次结构带来的计算和存储负担。

Result: 在长上下文QA基准测试中表现优于基线，存储和运行时间减少一个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在提升检索准确性的同时显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress in natural
language processing, but their limited ability to retain long-term context
constrains performance on document-level or multi-turn tasks.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving relevant
information from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems often rely
on embedding-based retrieval trained on corpus-level semantic similarity, which
can lead to retrieving content that is semantically similar in form but
misaligned with the question's true intent. Furthermore, recent RAG variants
construct graph- or hierarchy-based structures to improve retrieval accuracy,
resulting in significant computation and storage overhead. In this paper, we
propose an embedding-free retrieval framework. Our method leverages the logical
inferencing ability of LLMs in retrieval using iterative search space
refinement guided by our novel importance measure and extend our retrieval
results with logically related information without explicit graph construction.
Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks, including NovelQA and Marathon, show
that our approach outperforms strong baselines while reducing storage and
runtime by over an order of magnitude.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖数据驱动的合成指令对进行监督微调（SFT），但忽视了子上下文的重要性，导致SFT效果不佳。

Method: 提出MISO框架，将顺序指令转换为并行指令，引入混合上下文范式，同时考虑整体指令-输出对齐和子上下文的影响。

Result: 实验证明MISO在复杂指令跟随任务中表现优越，且具有训练效率潜力。

Conclusion: MISO是一种有效的LLM微调方法，显著提升了复杂指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in handling
natural language tasks; however, they may struggle to consistently follow
complex instructions including those involve multiple constraints.
Post-training LLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach to
improve their ability to follow instructions. In addressing complex instruction
following, existing efforts primarily focus on data-driven methods that
synthesize complex instruction-output pairs for SFT. However, insufficient
attention allocated to crucial sub-contexts may reduce the effectiveness of
SFT. In this work, we propose transforming sequentially structured input
instruction into multiple parallel instructions containing subcontexts. To
support processing this multi-input, we propose MISO (Multi-Input
Single-Output), an extension to currently dominant decoder-only
transformer-based LLMs. MISO introduces a mixture-of-contexts paradigm that
jointly considers the overall instruction-output alignment and the influence of
individual sub-contexts to enhance SFT effectiveness. We apply MISO fine-tuning
to complex instructionfollowing datasets and evaluate it with standard LLM
inference. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MISO as a
fine-tuning method for LLMs, both in terms of effectiveness in complex
instruction-following scenarios and its potential for training efficiency.

Method: 提出数学框架描述自我修正，并通过实验（如文本去毒任务）验证提示诱导的线性表征对概念对齐的影响。

Result: 实验显示，提示诱导的变化与毒性标记的未嵌入向量内积存在显著差异，表明自我修正增强了潜在概念识别能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自我修正的底层机制，为解释提示的作用提供了理论支持，代码已开源以保证可复现性。

Abstract: We provide an explanation for the performance gains of intrinsic
self-correction, a process where a language model iteratively refines its
outputs without external feedback. More precisely, we investigate how prompting
induces interpretable changes in hidden states and thus affects the output
distributions. We hypothesize that each prompt-induced shift lies in a linear
span of some linear representation vectors, naturally separating tokens based
on individual concept alignment. Building around this idea, we give a
mathematical formulation of self-correction and derive a concentration result
for output tokens based on alignment magnitudes. Our experiments on text
detoxification with zephyr-7b-sft reveal a substantial gap in the inner
products of the prompt-induced shifts and the unembeddings of the top-100 most
toxic tokens vs. those of the unembeddings of the bottom-100 least toxic
tokens, under toxic instructions. This suggests that self-correction prompts
enhance a language model's capability of latent concept recognition. Our
analysis offers insights into the underlying mechanism of self-correction by
characterizing how prompting works explainably. For reproducibility, our code
is available.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中复杂查询的意图识别问题，尤其是在资源受限和查询具有嵌套结构的情况下。

Result: 通过子查询的原子性，显著提升文档检索和响应生成的精确性。

Conclusion: QCompiler有效提升了RAG系统处理复杂查询的能力。

Abstract: Precise recognition of search intent in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems remains a challenging goal, especially under resource constraints and
for complex queries with nested structures and dependencies. This paper
presents QCompiler, a neuro-symbolic framework inspired by linguistic grammar
rules and compiler design, to bridge this gap. It theoretically designs a
minimal yet sufficient Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar $G[q]$ to formalize
complex queries. Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness
while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a Query
Expression Translator, a Lexical Syntax Parser, and a Recursive Descent
Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution.
The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise
document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG
system's ability to address complex queries.

Motivation: 图表编辑任务对MLLMs提出了更高要求，但现有评估方法缺乏全面性，亟需一个高质量的基准。

Method: 提出ChartEdit基准，包含1,405条编辑指令和233个真实图表，通过手动标注验证准确性，并对10种主流MLLMs进行评估。

Result: 大模型能生成部分匹配参考图像的代码，但精确编辑能力有限（SOTA模型得分仅59.96）；小模型表现更差。

Conclusion: 图表编辑任务仍需进一步研究，ChartEdit为未来工作提供了评估基础。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating
chart rendering code, chart editing presents a greater challenge. This
difficulty stems from its nature as a labor-intensive task for humans that also
demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding, complex reasoning, and precise
intent interpretation. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities,
current assessments typically rely on limited case studies rather than robust
evaluation methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive
evaluation framework. In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality
benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises $1,405$
diverse editing instructions applied to $233$ real-world charts, with each
instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for
accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream
MLLMs across two types of experiments, assessing them at both the code and
chart levels. The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to
produce images that partially match the reference images. However, their
ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains
limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only $59.96$,
highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast,
small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following
editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need
for further development in this area. Code is available at

Result: HiPPrO在意图一致性上提升38%，Rouge分数也有显著提高，人类评估证实其优越性。

Conclusion: 多属性条件能显著提升反仇恨言论生成系统的效果。

Abstract: Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online.
Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on
specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering
multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective
responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with
Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the
effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically
optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase.
Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference
optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we
extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with
emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix
optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive
evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a ~38 % improvement in intent
conformity and a ~3 %, ~2 %, ~3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L,
respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further
substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced
relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech. This work
underscores the potential of multi-attribute conditioning in advancing the
efficacy of counterspeech generation systems.

If a text contains offensive content, we further classify it into different
hate speech targets such as religion, gender, politics, ethnicity, origin, and
others. A text can contain either single or multiple targets. Multiple
annotators are involved in the data annotation task. We calculated the
inter-annotator agreement, which was reported to be 0.86 for offensive content
and 0.71 for multiple hate speech targets. Finally, we evaluated the data
annotation task by employing a different transformers-based model in which

Abstract: Considering the inherent limitations of parametric knowledge in large
language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely employed
to expand their knowledge scope. Since RAG has shown promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks like open-domain question answering, its broader
application to complex tasks and intelligent assistants has further advanced
its utility. Despite this progress, the underlying knowledge utilization
mechanisms of LLM-based RAG remain underexplored. In this paper, we present a
systematic investigation of the intrinsic mechanisms by which LLMs integrate
internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge in RAG scenarios.
Specially, we employ knowledge stream analysis at the macroscopic level, and
investigate the function of individual modules at the microscopic level.
Drawing on knowledge streaming analyses, we decompose the knowledge utilization
process into four distinct stages within LLM layers: knowledge refinement,
knowledge elicitation, knowledge expression, and knowledge contestation. We
further demonstrate that the relevance of passages guides the streaming of
knowledge through these stages. At the module level, we introduce a new method,
knowledge activation probability entropy (KAPE) for neuron identification
associated with either internal or external knowledge. By selectively
deactivating these neurons, we achieve targeted shifts in the LLM's reliance on
one knowledge source over the other. Moreover, we discern complementary roles
for multi-head attention and multi-layer perceptron layers during knowledge
formation. These insights offer a foundation for improving interpretability and
reliability in retrieval-augmented LLMs, paving the way for more robust and
transparent generative solutions in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: Argument mining has garnered increasing attention over the years, with the
recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) further propelling this
trend. However, current argument relations remain relatively simplistic and
foundational, struggling to capture the full scope of argument information,
particularly when it comes to representing complex argument structures in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose 14 fine-grained
relation types from both vertical and horizontal dimensions, thereby capturing
the intricate interplay between argument components for a thorough
understanding of argument structure. On this basis, we conducted extensive
experiments on three tasks: argument component detection, relation prediction,
and automated essay grading. Additionally, we explored the impact of writing
quality on argument component detection and relation prediction, as well as the
connections between discourse relations and argumentative features. The
findings highlight the importance of fine-grained argumentative annotations for
argumentative writing quality assessment and encourage multi-dimensional
argument analysis.

### [45] [MoL for LLMs: Dual-Loss Optimization to Enhance Domain Expertise While Preserving General Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12043)
*Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Qianchun Lu,Siyuan Fang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mixture of Losses (MoL)的新框架，通过解耦领域特定和通用语料的优化目标，解决了传统CPT方法中的领域偏差和语料混合比例问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在通用任务中表现良好，但在领域特定应用中存在幻觉和准确性限制。传统CPT方法面临领域偏差数据损害通用语言能力以及语料混合比例不当的问题。

Method: 提出MoL框架，使用交叉熵损失（CE）处理领域数据以确保知识获取，同时使用KL散度对齐通用语料训练与基础模型的通用能力。

Result: 实验表明，1:1的领域与通用语料比例能最优平衡训练与过拟合。模型在Math-500基准测试中非思考推理模式下准确率提升27.9%，在AIME25子集的思考模式下提升83.3%。

Conclusion: MoL框架有效保留了通用能力并增强了领域专业知识，避免了灾难性遗忘，显著优于传统CPT方法。

Abstract: Although LLMs perform well in general tasks, domain-specific applications
suffer from hallucinations and accuracy limitations. CPT approaches encounter
two key issues: (1) domain-biased data degrades general language skills, and
(2) improper corpus-mixture ratios limit effective adaptation. To address
these, we propose a novel framework, Mixture of Losses (MoL), which decouples
optimization objectives for domain-specific and general corpora. Specifically,
cross-entropy (CE) loss is applied to domain data to ensure knowledge
acquisition, while Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence aligns general-corpus
training with the base model's foundational capabilities. This dual-loss
architecture preserves universal skills while enhancing domain expertise,
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, we validate that a 1:1
domain-to-general corpus ratio optimally balances training and overfitting
without the need for extensive tuning or resource-intensive experiments.
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate significant performance gains compared
to traditional CPT approaches, which often suffer from degradation in general
language capabilities; our model achieves 27.9% higher accuracy on the Math-500
benchmark in the non-think reasoning mode, and an impressive 83.3% improvement
on the challenging AIME25 subset in the think mode, underscoring the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Vinod Raman,Hilal Asi,Satyen Kale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应的Best-of-N采样策略，通过动态分配计算资源，提升语言模型对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在计算上昂贵且未考虑不同提示的对齐难度差异，因此需要更高效的资源分配策略。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：探索阶段估计奖励分布，第二阶段自适应分配计算资源。

Result: 在AlpacaEval数据集上，自适应策略在相同计算预算下优于均匀分配，且在大批量时表现更优。

Conclusion: 自适应策略高效且实用，适用于任何语言模型和奖励模型组合。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling,
offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward
preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be
computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts
without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we
propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates
inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we
develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the
reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a
second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates.
Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM/RM combination.
Empirical results on the AlpacaEval dataset for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different
batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy consistently outperforms the
uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, our experiments
show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations
with 20% larger inference budgets and even improves in performance as the batch
size grows.

gender-related harmful behaviors exhibited by LLMs. We release GenderBench as
an open-source and extensible library to improve the reproducibility and
robustness of benchmarking across the field. We also publish our evaluation of
12 LLMs. Our measurements reveal consistent patterns in their behavior. We show
that LLMs struggle with stereotypical reasoning, equitable gender

Result: 在多种开源和闭源LLMs上验证SAGE的有效性，平均防御成功率达99%，同时保持通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: SAGE为未来LLMs的安全意识和生成行为一致性提供了贡献，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
various tasks but remain vulnerable to meticulously crafted jailbreak attacks.
In this paper, we identify a critical safety gap: while LLMs are adept at
detecting jailbreak prompts, they often produce unsafe responses when directly
processing these inputs. Inspired by this insight, we propose SAGE (Self-Aware
Guard Enhancement), a training-free defense strategy designed to align LLMs'
strong safety discrimination performance with their relatively weaker safety
generation ability. SAGE consists of two core components: a Discriminative
Analysis Module and a Discriminative Response Module, enhancing resilience
against sophisticated jailbreak attempts through flexible safety discrimination
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness and
robustness across various open-source and closed-source LLMs of different sizes
and architectures, achieving an average 99% defense success rate against
numerous complex and covert jailbreak methods while maintaining helpfulness on
general benchmarks. We further conduct mechanistic interpretability analysis
through hidden states and attention distributions, revealing the underlying
mechanisms of this detection-generation discrepancy. Our work thus contributes
to developing future LLMs with coherent safety awareness and generation
behavior. Our code and datasets are publicly available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SAGE.

Motivation: 探索形态生产力的认知计算基础及个体历时变化，揭示语言生成与理解的系统性。

Method: 采用判别词典模型分析芬兰语、马来语和英语的形态模式；通过托马斯·曼的阅读与写作数据研究历时变化。

Result: 模型显示词缀与语义中心关联；托马斯·曼的新词生成率极低，输入远多于输出。

Conclusion: 形态生产力受系统性关联影响，个体词汇创新受输入与语义距离限制。

Abstract: In this study, we approach morphological productivity from two perspectives:
a cognitive-computational perspective, and a diachronic perspective zooming in
on an actual speaker, Thomas Mann. For developing the first perspective, we
make use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the
discriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and
meaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered
words, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between
the form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning
would be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but
there is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test
data. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English
compounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a
computational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional
and word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to
associate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of
the words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study
how the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over
time. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have
read, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived
words is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his
output. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word
with a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of
all derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of
using speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.

Result: 演示和指令的函数向量利用不同模型组件，任务表示不完全相同。

Conclusion: 不同任务提示方式引发不同机制，支持结合指令和演示的实践，并需进一步研究任务推理机制。

Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting
language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks
elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An
improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer
interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through
function vectors, recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task
representations. We generalize function vectors to alternative task
presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully
extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We
find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors
leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate
their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different
task presentations do not induce a common task representation but elicit
different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support
to the practice of combining textual instructions and task demonstrations,
imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation
forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising technique for enhancing large

relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation
of model merging techniques during the pre-training process. Through extensive
experiments with both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures ranging
from millions to over 100 billion parameters, we demonstrate that merging
checkpoints trained with constant learning rates not only achieves significant
performance improvements but also enables accurate prediction of annealing
behavior. These improvements lead to both more efficient model development and
significantly lower training costs. Our detailed ablation studies on merging
strategies and hyperparameters provide new insights into the underlying
mechanisms while uncovering novel applications. Through comprehensive
experimental analysis, we offer the open-source community practical
pre-training guidelines for effective model merging.

Conclusion: 个性化提示方法能部分解决LLMs在混淆作者身份时的双峰分布问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in
obfuscating authorship by paraphrasing and altering writing styles. Rather than
adopting a holistic approach that evaluates performance across the entire
dataset, we focus on user-wise performance to analyze how obfuscation
effectiveness varies across individual authors. While LLMs are generally
effective, we observe a bimodal distribution of efficacy, with performance
varying significantly across users. To address this, we propose a personalized
prompting method that outperforms standard prompting techniques and partially
mitigates the bimodality issue.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM生成结果的公平性、公正性和可靠性，适用于实际场景，为LLMs在伦理敏感任务中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) push the bound-aries in natural language
processing and generative AI, driving progress across various aspects of modern
society. Unfortunately, the pervasive issue of bias in LLMs responses (i.e.,
predictions) poses a significant and open challenge, hindering their
application in tasks involving ethical sensitivity and responsible
decision-making. In this work, we propose a straightforward, user-friendly and
practical method to mitigate such biases, enhancing the reliability and
trustworthiness of LLMs. Our method creates multiple variations of a given
sentence by modifying specific attributes and evaluates the corresponding
prediction behavior compared to the original, unaltered, prediction/sentence.
The idea behind this process is that critical ethical predictions often exhibit
notable inconsistencies, indicating the presence of bias. Unlike previous
approaches, our method relies solely on forward passes (i.e., testing-time
adversaries), eliminating the need for training, fine-tuning, or prior
knowledge of the training data distribution. Through extensive experiments on
the popular Llama family, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
improving various fairness metrics, focusing on the reduction of disparities in
how the model treats individuals from different racial groups. Specifically,
using standard metrics, we improve the fairness in Llama3 in up to 27
percentage points. Overall, our approach significantly enhances fairness,
equity, and reliability in LLM-generated results without parameter tuning or
training data modifications, confirming its effectiveness in practical
scenarios. We believe our work establishes an important step toward enabling
the use of LLMs in tasks that require ethical considerations and responsible
decision-making.

Abstract: Content moderation research has recently made significant advances, but still
fails to serve the majority of the world's languages due to the lack of
resources, leaving millions of vulnerable users to online hostility. This work
presents a large-scale human-annotated multi-task benchmark dataset for abusive
language detection in Tigrinya social media with joint annotations for three
tasks: abusiveness, sentiment, and topic classification. The dataset comprises
13,717 YouTube comments annotated by nine native speakers, collected from 7,373
videos with a total of over 1.2 billion views across 51 channels. We developed
an iterative term clustering approach for effective data selection. Recognizing
that around 64% of Tigrinya social media content uses Romanized
transliterations rather than native Ge'ez script, our dataset accommodates both
writing systems to reflect actual language use. We establish strong baselines
across the tasks in the benchmark, while leaving significant challenges for
future contributions. Our experiments reveal that small, specialized multi-task
models outperform the current frontier models in the low-resource setting,
achieving up to 86% accuracy (+7 points) in abusiveness detection. We make the
resources publicly available to promote research on online safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SES如何影响人们与语言技术的互动，弥补以往研究依赖代理指标和合成数据的不足。

Method: 调查1000名不同SES背景的个体，收集6482条与LLM的互动提示，分析使用频率、任务、互动风格和话题。

Result: 高SES群体更抽象、简洁，话题涉及包容性和旅行；低SES群体更拟人化、具体。

Conclusion: 语言技术需考虑SES差异以减少数字鸿沟，避免AI使用中的社会经济分层。

Abstract: Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with
each other and more recently, with digital technologies like Large Language
Models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between
SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and
synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and
collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find
systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e.,
frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entails
a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like
'inclusivity' and 'travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher
anthropomorphization of LLMs (using ''hello'' and ''thank you'') and more
concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language
technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic
differences still stratify their use to exacerbate the digital divide. These
differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language
technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic
factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups.

Abstract: Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) play a crucial role in
shaping public discourse and societal norms. This study examines the term
Sessiz Istila (Silent Invasion) on Turkish social media, highlighting the rise
of anti-refugee sentiment amidst the Syrian refugee influx. Using BERTurk and
the TREMO dataset, we developed an advanced Emotion Recognition Model (ERM)
tailored for Turkish, achieving 92.62% accuracy in categorizing emotions such
as happiness, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and surprise. By applying this
model to large-scale X data, the study uncovers emotional nuances in Turkish
discourse, contributing to computational social science by advancing sentiment
analysis in underrepresented languages and enhancing our understanding of
global digital discourse and the unique linguistic challenges of Turkish. The
findings underscore the transformative potential of localized NLP tools, with
our ERM model offering practical applications for real-time sentiment analysis
in Turkish-language contexts. By addressing critical areas, including
marketing, public relations, and crisis management, these models facilitate
improved decision-making through timely and accurate sentiment tracking. This
highlights the significance of advancing research that accounts for regional

Result: 实验证明‘真实性神经元’普遍存在于不同规模的语言模型中，且其分布模式与真实性几何学的研究一致。抑制这些神经元会降低模型在多个基准测试中的表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型真实性的机制，为提升其可信度和可靠性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success and deployment across diverse workflows,
language models sometimes produce untruthful responses. Our limited
understanding of how truthfulness is mechanistically encoded within these
models jeopardizes their reliability and safety. In this paper, we propose a
method for identifying representations of truthfulness at the neuron level. We
show that language models contain truth neurons, which encode truthfulness in a
subject-agnostic manner. Experiments conducted across models of varying scales
validate the existence of truth neurons, confirming that the encoding of
truthfulness at the neuron level is a property shared by many language models.
The distribution patterns of truth neurons over layers align with prior
findings on the geometry of truthfulness. Selectively suppressing the
activations of truth neurons found through the TruthfulQA dataset degrades
performance both on TruthfulQA and on other benchmarks, showing that the
truthfulness mechanisms are not tied to a specific dataset. Our results offer
novel insights into the mechanisms underlying truthfulness in language models
and highlight potential directions toward improving their trustworthiness and
reliability.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
sectors has highlighted the need for empirical research to understand their
biases, thought patterns, and societal implications to ensure ethical and
effective use. In this study, we propose a novel framework for evaluating LLMs,
focusing on uncovering their ideological biases through a quantitative analysis
of 436 binary-choice questions, many of which have no definitive answer. By
applying our framework to ChatGPT and Gemini, findings revealed that while LLMs
generally maintain consistent opinions on many topics, their ideologies differ
across models and languages. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits a tendency to change
their opinion to match the questioner's opinion. Both models also exhibited
problematic biases, unethical or unfair claims, which might have negative
societal impacts. These results underscore the importance of addressing both
ideological and ethical considerations when evaluating LLMs. The proposed
framework offers a flexible, quantitative method for assessing LLM behavior,
providing valuable insights for the development of more socially aligned AI
systems.

Result: 结果显示逆向缩放现象，表明模型规模增大后预测能力下降。

Conclusion: LLMs与人类句子处理存在显著不匹配，且随着模型规模增大而加剧。

Abstract: The impressive linguistic abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
recommended them as models of human sentence processing, with some conjecturing
a positive 'quality-power' relationship (Wilcox et al., 2023), in which
language models' (LMs') fit to psychometric data continues to improve as their
ability to predict words in context increases. This is important because it
suggests that elements of LLM architecture, such as veridical attention to
context and a unique objective of predicting upcoming words, reflect the
architecture of the human sentence processing faculty, and that any
inadequacies in predicting human reading time and brain imaging data may be
attributed to insufficient model complexity, which recedes as larger models
become available. Recent studies (Oh and Schuler, 2023) have shown this scaling
inverts after a point, as LMs become excessively large and accurate, when word
prediction probability (as information-theoretic surprisal) is used as a
predictor. Other studies propose the use of entire vectors from differently
sized LLMs, still showing positive scaling (Schrimpf et al., 2021), casting
doubt on the value of surprisal as a predictor, but do not control for the
larger number of predictors in vectors from larger LMs. This study evaluates
LLM scaling using entire LLM vectors, while controlling for the larger number
of predictors in vectors from larger LLMs. Results show that inverse scaling
obtains, suggesting that inadequacies in predicting human reading time and
brain imaging data may be due to substantial misalignment between LLMs and
human sentence processing, which worsens as larger models are used.

*Xiyan Fu,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-as-a-Judge在评估多语言任务时表现不一致，尤其在低资源语言中更差，训练数据或模型规模无法直接改善一致性。提出一种集成策略以提高实际应用中的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言环境下LLM-as-a-Judge的可靠性，填补其在多语言评估中的不确定性。

Method: 评估五个不同模型家族的模型在五个任务和25种语言中的表现，分析影响因素。

Result: LLM在多语言任务中一致性较差（平均Fleiss' Kappa约0.3），低资源语言表现更差，训练数据或模型规模无直接改善。

Conclusion: LLM在多语言评估中尚不可靠，提出集成策略以提升一致性。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a popular evaluation strategy, where advanced
large language models assess generation results in alignment with human
instructions. While these models serve as a promising alternative to human
annotators, their reliability in multilingual evaluation remains uncertain. To
bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multilingual
LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, we evaluate five models from different model
families across five diverse tasks involving 25 languages. Our findings reveal
that LLMs struggle to achieve consistent judgment results across languages,
with an average Fleiss' Kappa of approximately 0.3, and some models performing
even worse. To investigate the cause of inconsistency, we analyze various
influencing factors. We observe that consistency varies significantly across
languages, with particularly poor performance in low-resource languages.
Additionally, we find that neither training on multilingual data nor increasing
model scale directly improves judgment consistency. These findings suggest that
LLMs are not yet reliable for evaluating multilingual predictions. We finally
propose an ensemble strategy which improves the consistency of the multilingual
judge in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Data Whisperer是一种无需训练、基于注意力的高效数据选择方法，通过少样本上下文学习优化LLM微调的数据子集选择，显著提升性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模增大，传统数据选择方法效率低且资源消耗大，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡性能与计算成本。

Method: 提出Data Whisperer，利用少样本上下文学习直接从目标模型中提取注意力信息，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种任务和模型上验证，仅用10%数据即可超越完整数据集性能，性能提升3.1分，速度提升7.4倍。

Conclusion: Data Whisperer为LLM微调提供了一种高效、低成本的数据选择方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on task-specific data is essential
for their effective deployment. As dataset sizes grow, efficiently selecting
optimal subsets for training becomes crucial to balancing performance and
computational costs. Traditional data selection methods often require
fine-tuning a scoring model on the target dataset, which is time-consuming and
resource-intensive, or rely on heuristics that fail to fully leverage the
model's predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Data
Whisperer, an efficient, training-free, attention-based method that leverages
few-shot in-context learning with the model to be fine-tuned. Comprehensive
evaluations were conducted on both raw and synthetic datasets across diverse
tasks and models. Notably, Data Whisperer achieves superior performance
compared to the full GSM8K dataset on the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, using just
10% of the data, and outperforms existing methods with a 3.1-point improvement
and a 7.4$\times$ speedup.

Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文场景中面临计算效率低和信息冗余的挑战，需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: GMSA采用组合并和层语义对齐（LSA）技术，通过自动编码器训练学习软标记，并结合知识提取微调（KEFT）适应下游任务。

Result: GMSA在上下文恢复和下游问答任务中表现优异，实现了2倍的推理加速，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GMSA是一种高效且通用的上下文压缩框架，适用于长上下文场景，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in a
variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, when applied to
long-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational
efficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a
context compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which
addresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant
information. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer
Semantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently
extract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on
the other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level
primary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different
layers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain
complete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to
downstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract
knowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks. We train GMSA by randomly
sampling the compression rate for each sample in the dataset. Under this
condition, GMSA not only significantly outperforms the traditional compression
paradigm in context restoration but also achieves stable and significantly
faster convergence with only a few encoder layers. In downstream
question-answering (QA) tasks, GMSA can achieve approximately a 2x speedup in
end-to-end inference while outperforming both the original input prompts and
various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: UniCuCo提出了一种通用模型，用于高效处理LLMs的多请求剪枝任务，通过StratNet学习最优剪枝策略，速度提升28倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法处理多请求时效率低下，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 引入StratNet学习剪枝策略，利用高斯过程近似评估，解决非可微问题。

Result: UniCuCo处理64个请求时速度提升28倍，精度与基线相当。

Conclusion: UniCuCo显著提升了多请求剪枝的效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving
high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these
methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's
compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number
of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple
simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model
for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that
learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The
challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of
evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning
process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To
overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the
evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable,
we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning
process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that
UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while
maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析arXiv数据集中的823,798篇摘要，探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对学术写作语言特征的影响，发现LLMs显著增加了摘要中偏好词汇的使用，并改变了词汇复杂性、句法复杂性和情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多通过定量方法分析LLMs在学术写作中的使用，但缺乏对其语言特征影响的系统性研究。

Method: 研究对过去十年arXiv数据集中的摘要进行了大规模语言分析，包括词汇偏好、复杂性、句法、连贯性、可读性和情感等特征。

Result: 结果显示LLMs显著增加了偏好词汇的使用，提高了词汇复杂性和情感表达，但降低了句法复杂性、连贯性和可读性。英语能力较弱的学者更倾向于使用LLMs。

Conclusion: LLMs对学术写作风格产生了广泛影响，尤其是在计算机科学领域，而数学领域变化较小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have prompted academic
concerns about their impact on academic writing. Existing studies have
primarily examined LLM usage in academic writing through quantitative
approaches, such as word frequency statistics and probability-based analyses.
However, few have systematically examined the potential impact of LLMs on the
linguistic characteristics of academic writing. To address this gap, we
conducted a large-scale analysis across 823,798 abstracts published in last
decade from arXiv dataset. Through the linguistic analysis of features such as
the frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,
cohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant
increase in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the
widespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an
increase in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease
in syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and
simplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and
readability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are
becoming more difficult to read. Moreover, our analysis reveals that scholars
with weaker English proficiency were more likely to use the LLMs for academic
writing, and focused on improving the overall logic and fluency of the
abstracts. Finally, at discipline level, we found that scholars in Computer
Science showed more pronounced changes in writing style, while the changes in
Mathematics were minimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE)面临标注数据稀缺和现有模型泛化能力不足的挑战，大语言模型虽通过上下文学习展示潜力，但其通用目标导致任务特定性能不佳。

Method: TKRE框架结合大语言模型与传统模型，生成解释驱动的知识和模式约束的合成数据，并采用两阶段预训练策略（MSLM和SCL）增强关系推理和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，TKRE在FSRE任务中达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: TKRE通过创新框架有效解决了FSRE的挑战，展示了在低资源场景中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE) remains a challenging task due to the
scarcity of annotated data and the limited generalization capabilities of
existing models. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
potential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose
training objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific
relation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage
Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that
synergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,
bridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two
key innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge
and schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;
and (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language
Modeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational
reasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to
effectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in
FSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource
scenarios. \footnote{The code and data are released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs对敏感信息的记忆风险，缺乏真实且多样化的数据集。

Method: 通过构建合成配置文件，生成多样化的内容类型，并嵌入PII，验证数据集的有效性。

Result: 数据集显示PII记忆率随重复增加而变化，且不同内容类型风险不同。

Conclusion: PANORAMA为隐私风险评估和隐私保护LLMs开发提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The memorization of sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII)
by large language models (LLMs) poses growing privacy risks as models scale and
are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Existing efforts to study
sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are
hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced
datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We
introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online
Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic
corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to
closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive
data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation
pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute
human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics
such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a
combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse
content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum
discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each
embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive
information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B
model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and
measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with
repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's
ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code
are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk
assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.

Result: 低熵或高熵分布、含异常标记的分布以及由其他语言模型生成的分布更容易近似。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型的表达能力及其作为概率分布生成器的挑战。

Abstract: Autoregressive neural language models (LMs) generate a probability
distribution over tokens at each time step given a prompt. In this work, we
attempt to systematically understand the probability distributions that LMs can
produce, showing that some distributions are significantly harder to elicit
than others. Specifically, for any target next-token distribution over the
vocabulary, we attempt to find a prompt that induces the LM to output a
distribution as close as possible to the target, using either soft or hard
gradient-based prompt tuning. We find that (1) in general, distributions with
very low or very high entropy are easier to approximate than those with
moderate entropy; (2) among distributions with the same entropy, those
containing ''outlier tokens'' are easier to approximate; (3) target
distributions generated by LMs -- even LMs with different tokenizers -- are
easier to approximate than randomly chosen targets. These results offer
insights into the expressiveness of LMs and the challenges of using them as
probability distribution proposers.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖LLM合成的指令数据，但数据多样性不足且成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出EQUAL框架，通过文档聚类和动态选择策略迭代提取高质量QA对。

Result: 实验表明EQUAL降低5-10倍计算成本，并在LLaMA和Mistral模型上提升2.5%准确率。

Conclusion: EQUAL为指令调优提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据提取方法。

Abstract: Instruction tuning improves the performance of large language models (LLMs),
but it heavily relies on high-quality training data. Recently, LLMs have been
used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs.
However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be
similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from
web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to
retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this
faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is
prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to
the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these
issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework
that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair
extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document
corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a
multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to
contain valuable QA pairs. This iterative approach significantly reduces
computational cost while boosting model performance. Experiments on
AutoMathText and StackOverflow across four downstream tasks show that EQUAL
reduces computational costs by 5-10x and improves accuracy by 2.5 percent on
LLaMA-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B

Conclusion: Teach2Eval提供了一种新颖、可扩展且多功能的LLM评估方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the development
of effective evaluation methods. Traditional benchmarks rely on task-specific
metrics and static datasets, which often suffer from fairness issues, limited
scalability, and contamination risks. In this paper, we introduce Teach2Eval,
an indirect evaluation framework inspired by the Feynman Technique. Instead of
directly testing LLMs on predefined tasks, our method evaluates a model's
multiple abilities to teach weaker student models to perform tasks effectively.
By converting open-ended tasks into standardized multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) through teacher-generated feedback, Teach2Eval enables scalable,
automated, and multi-dimensional assessment. Our approach not only avoids data
leakage and memorization but also captures a broad range of cognitive abilities
that are orthogonal to current benchmarks. Experimental results across 26
leading LLMs show strong alignment with existing human and model-based dynamic
rankings, while offering additional interpretability for training guidance.

Result: 实验表明RATE-FT在LongFact上比通用微调方法提升3%。

Conclusion: RATE-FT在开放域长文本幻觉检测中表现出高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect information, remains a
significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in
open-domain long-form generation. Existing approaches for detecting
hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely
heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.
  In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination
detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal
states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient
for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual
and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing
approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with
fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we
introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an
auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of
hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a
variety of model families & datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on
LongFact.

Abstract: Understanding which neural components drive specific capabilities in
mid-sized language models ($\leq$10B parameters) remains a key challenge. We
introduce the $(\bm{K}, \epsilon)$-Minimum Sufficient Head Circuit ($K$-MSHC),
a methodology to identify minimal sets of attention heads crucial for
classification tasks as well as Search-K-MSHC, an efficient algorithm for
discovering these circuits. Applying our Search-K-MSHC algorithm to Gemma-9B,
we analyze three syntactic task families: grammar acceptability, arithmetic
verification, and arithmetic word problems. Our findings reveal distinct
task-specific head circuits, with grammar tasks predominantly utilizing early
layers, word problems showing pronounced activity in both shallow and deep
regions, and arithmetic verification demonstrating a more distributed pattern
across the network. We discover non-linear circuit overlap patterns, where
different task pairs share computational components at varying levels of
importance. While grammar and arithmetic share many "weak" heads, arithmetic
and word problems share more consistently critical "strong" heads. Importantly,
we find that each task maintains dedicated "super-heads" with minimal
cross-task overlap, suggesting that syntactic and numerical competencies emerge
from specialized yet partially reusable head circuits.

Motivation: 低资源语言和多方言语言的机器翻译评估因缺乏高质量参考翻译和方言特定上下文而面临挑战。

Method: 扩展ONUBAD数据集，加入Sylheti-英语句子对和DA评分；增强分词器词汇；引入回归头和方言指导提示策略。

Result: 在多个LLM上评估，框架表现优于现有方法，Spearman相关性最高提升+0.1083。

Conclusion: 提出的方言指导框架显著提升了低资源语言MT评估效果，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages poses a
persistent challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of high quality
reference translations. This issue is further exacerbated in languages with
multiple dialects, where linguistic diversity and data scarcity hinder robust
evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising solution through
reference-free evaluation techniques; however, their effectiveness diminishes
in the absence of dialect-specific context and tailored guidance. In this work,
we propose a comprehensive framework that enhances LLM-based MT evaluation
using a dialect guided approach. We extend the ONUBAD dataset by incorporating
Sylheti-English sentence pairs, corresponding machine translations, and Direct
Assessment (DA) scores annotated by native speakers. To address the vocabulary
gap, we augment the tokenizer vocabulary with dialect-specific terms. We
further introduce a regression head to enable scalar score prediction and
design a dialect-guided (DG) prompting strategy. Our evaluation across multiple
LLMs shows that the proposed pipeline consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving the highest gain of +0.1083 in Spearman correlation, along
with improvements across other evaluation settings. The dataset and the code

Conclusion: 强调需要语言感知对齐和跨语言防御，推动更健壮和包容的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread applications across various
domains, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt injections. While most
existing research on jailbreak attacks and hallucination phenomena has focused
primarily on open-source models, we investigate the frontier of closed-source
LLMs under multilingual attack scenarios. We present a first-of-its-kind
integrated adversarial framework that leverages diverse attack techniques to
systematically evaluate frontier proprietary solutions, including GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, Gemini-1.5-Pro, and Qwen-Max. Our evaluation spans six categories
of security contents in both English and Chinese, generating 38,400 responses
across 32 types of jailbreak attacks. Attack success rate (ASR) is utilized as
the quantitative metric to assess performance from three dimensions: prompt
design, model architecture, and language environment. Our findings suggest that
Qwen-Max is the most vulnerable, while GPT-4o shows the strongest defense.
Notably, prompts in Chinese consistently yield higher ASRs than their English
counterparts, and our novel Two-Sides attack technique proves to be the most
effective across all models. This work highlights a dire need for
language-aware alignment and robust cross-lingual defenses in LLMs, and we hope
it will inspire researchers, developers, and policymakers toward more robust
and inclusive AI systems.

*Kun Huang,Weikai Xu,Yuxuan Liu,Quandong Wang,Pengzhi Gao,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Bin Wang,Bo An*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种迭代偏好学习（IPL）方法，通过构建CoaT-tree和T-DPO对，解决了CoaT轨迹稀缺问题，并在移动GUI任务中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理CoaT轨迹稀缺时，忽视了中间推理步骤的正确性或依赖昂贵的过程级标注。

Method: 提出IPL方法，包括CoaT-tree构建、基于规则的奖励评分和T-DPO对生成，并引入三阶段指令演化以防止过拟合。

Result: MobileIPL在三个标准移动GUI基准测试中表现优于基线模型，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IPL方法有效提升了移动GUI代理的性能和泛化能力，为数据稀缺问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: The Chain of Action-Planning Thoughts (CoaT) paradigm has been shown to
improve the reasoning performance of VLM-based mobile agents in GUI tasks.
However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness
and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly
employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the
correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive
process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address
the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that
constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using
rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct
Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up
supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction
evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real
mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding.
Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our
agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining
models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three standard Mobile GUI-Agents benchmarks and shows strong
generalization to out-of-domain scenarios.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HBO是一种分层平衡优化方法，用于解决LLM微调中的数据不平衡和异质性问题，通过全局和局部优化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅关注全局数据平衡，忽视了局部数据的不平衡和异质性，限制了微调效果。

Method: HBO采用双层优化策略，包括全局和局部角色，通过奖励函数动态调整数据分配。

Result: 在多种任务和语言设置下，HBO显著优于基线方法，提升了准确性。

Conclusion: HBO为LLM微调中的数据问题提供了全面解决方案，提升了训练效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on a mixture of diverse datasets
poses challenges due to data imbalance and heterogeneity. Existing methods
often address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the
imbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits
their effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a
novel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during
fine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset
(locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of
actors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets
of the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage
within each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by
reward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning
progress and relative performance improvement. We evaluate HBO on three LLM
backbones across nine diverse tasks in multilingual and multitask setups.
Results show that HBO consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving
significant accuracy gains. Our in-depth analysis further demonstrates that
both the global actor and local actors of HBO effectively adjust data usage
during fine-tuning. HBO provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of
data imbalance and heterogeneity in LLM fine-tuning, enabling more effective
training across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了WikiDYK，一个基于维基百科动态更新的知识注入基准，用于测试语言模型的知识记忆能力，发现CLMs表现弱于BiLMs，并提出了一种协作框架提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏标准化和高质量的测试基准，大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识记忆能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用维基百科的“Did You Know...”条目构建WikiDYK基准，生成多样化的问题-答案对，并通过实验比较CLMs和BiLMs的表现。

Result: CLMs的知识记忆能力显著弱于BiLMs（可靠性准确率低23%），提出的协作框架进一步将准确率提升29.1%。

Conclusion: WikiDYK为评估LLMs知识记忆能力提供了有效工具，协作框架弥补了BiLMs规模较小的不足。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs), their knowledge
memorization capabilities remain underexplored, due to the lack of standardized
and high-quality test ground. In this paper, we introduce a novel, real-world
and large-scale knowledge injection benchmark that evolves continuously over
time without requiring human intervention. Specifically, we propose WikiDYK,
which leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's "Did
You Know..." entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia
editors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is
converted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats
from easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290
facts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future
updates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued
pre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern
LLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge
memorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs),
exhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the
smaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework
utilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate
with LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability
accuracy by up to 29.1%.

*Weixuan Wang,Minghao Wu,Barry Haddow,Alexandra Birch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExpertSteer利用外部专家模型生成引导向量，通过四步流程在推理过程中控制LLMs的行为，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多任务中表现优异，但如何引导其行为仍具挑战性。现有方法依赖模型自身生成的引导向量，限制了效果和外部专家模型的利用。

Method: ExpertSteer通过自动编码器对齐维度、互信息分析选择干预层、递归特征机生成引导向量，并在推理中应用这些向量。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，ExpertSteer显著优于基线方法，且成本极低。

Conclusion: ExpertSteer为LLMs的行为控制提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，突破了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various
tasks, yet guiding them to follow desired behaviours during inference remains a
significant challenge. Activation steering offers a promising method to control
the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations.
However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using
steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their
effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging
powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we
propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized
expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs.
ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM
through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions
with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying
intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating
steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and
finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to
selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct
comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four
distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly
outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在生成细粒度、可控且可解释的推理过程方面的能力，要求系统提取问题条件、分解推理链并验证逻辑有效性。

Method: 使用Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，设计少量示例和多轮提示，结合轻量级后处理正则表达式规范化输出。

Result: 在无需微调或外部资源的情况下，排名第五，F1分数与更复杂的方法相当。

Conclusion: 分析了方法的优缺点，并展望了未来在LLM结构化推理中的研究方向。

Abstract: We present Team asdfo123's submission to the LLMSR@XLLM25 shared task, which
evaluates large language models on producing fine-grained, controllable, and
interpretable reasoning processes. Systems must extract all problem conditions,
decompose a chain of thought into statement-evidence pairs, and verify the
logical validity of each pair. Leveraging only the off-the-shelf
Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we craft a concise few-shot, multi-turn prompt that
first enumerates all conditions and then guides the model to label, cite, and
adjudicate every reasoning step. A lightweight post-processor based on regular
expressions normalises spans and enforces the official JSON schema. Without
fine-tuning, external retrieval, or ensembling, our method ranks 5th overall,
achieving macro F1 scores on par with substantially more complex and
resource-consuming pipelines. We conclude by analysing the strengths and
limitations of our approach and outlining directions for future research in
structural reasoning with LLMs. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniEdit是一个基于开放领域知识的统一基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）编辑的准确性和可靠性。它通过多领域知识覆盖和创新的采样算法，解决了现有数据集在编辑范围和涟漪效应评估上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM编辑数据集通常局限于狭窄的知识领域，且编辑评估范围有限，未能全面反映编辑需求和涟漪效应的多样性。

Method: 1. 从25个常见领域中选择实体构建编辑样本；2. 设计NMCS算法采样子图以评估编辑的涟漪效应；3. 使用专有LLM将知识子图转换为自然语言文本。

Result: UniEdit基准在规模、全面性和多样性上表现出色，实验揭示了不同LLM和编辑器在开放知识领域中的编辑性能差异。

Conclusion: UniEdit为未来研究提供了有价值的基准，展示了LLM编辑在开放知识领域的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Model editing aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large language
models (LLMs) by efficiently adjusting their internal parameters. Currently,
most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a
limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of
editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In
this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing
grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by
selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories,
utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge
graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address
the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood
Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given
knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we
employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural
language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity.
Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and
diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across
multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths
and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation
criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLMs）会反映数据中的偏见，通过群体策略（如加权聚合）和混合群体（LLMs与人类结合）可有效减少偏见并提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs可能无意中放大训练数据中的偏见，需探索方法减少偏见。

Method: 分析LLMs对偏见标题的响应，尝试群体策略（平均响应、加权聚合）和混合群体（LLMs与人类结合）。

Result: 加权聚合和混合群体方法能减少偏见并提高准确性。

Conclusion: 混合群体方法结合LLMs的准确性和人类的多样性，显著减少偏见并提升性能。

Abstract: Despite their performance, large language models (LLMs) can inadvertently
perpetuate biases found in the data they are trained on. By analyzing LLM
responses to bias-eliciting headlines, we find that these models often mirror
human biases. To address this, we explore crowd-based strategies for mitigating
bias through response aggregation. We first demonstrate that simply averaging
responses from multiple LLMs, intended to leverage the "wisdom of the crowd",
can exacerbate existing biases due to the limited diversity within LLM crowds.
In contrast, we show that locally weighted aggregation methods more effectively
leverage the wisdom of the LLM crowd, achieving both bias mitigation and
improved accuracy. Finally, recognizing the complementary strengths of LLMs
(accuracy) and humans (diversity), we demonstrate that hybrid crowds containing
both significantly enhance performance and further reduce biases across ethnic
and gender-related contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提示注入是大型语言模型的主要安全风险，现有防护模型在上下文感知环境中的效果未被充分研究，且存在过度防御问题。

Method: 引入CAPTURE基准测试，通过少量域内示例评估攻击检测和过度防御倾向。

Result: 实验显示，现有防护模型在对抗性案例中漏报率高，在良性场景中误报率高。

Conclusion: CAPTURE揭示了当前提示注入防护模型的关键局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Prompt injection remains a major security risk for large language models.
However, the efficacy of existing guardrail models in context-aware settings
remains underexplored, as they often rely on static attack benchmarks.
Additionally, they have over-defense tendencies. We introduce CAPTURE, a novel
context-aware benchmark assessing both attack detection and over-defense
tendencies with minimal in-domain examples. Our experiments reveal that current
prompt injection guardrail models suffer from high false negatives in
adversarial cases and excessive false positives in benign scenarios,
highlighting critical limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于比较行为理论的方法，研究语言模型中数据与架构对偏见传播的影响，发现数据时间性、模型设计及架构对偏见传播有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于语言模型偏见的研究多关注数据质量，而忽视了模型架构和数据时间性的影响，且缺乏对偏见起源的系统研究。

Method: 采用比较行为理论方法，结合n-gram模型与Transformer架构，分析数据、模型设计及时间动态对偏见传播的影响。

Result: 发现n-gram模型对上下文窗口大小敏感，Transformer架构更稳健；数据时间性显著影响偏见；不同架构对偏见注入反应不同。

Conclusion: 需从数据和模型维度全面追溯偏见起源，而非仅关注表象，以减少语言模型的潜在危害。

Abstract: Current research on bias in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
data quality, with significantly less attention paid to model architecture and
temporal influences of data. Even more critically, few studies systematically
investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in
comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between
training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language
modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we
evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias
propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to
context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate
architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data
significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond
differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual
orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become
ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing
bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms,
to mitigate harm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLOT是一种参数高效的测试时推理方法，通过少量优化步骤更新样本特定参数向量，提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，SLOT旨在通过样本特定优化改善这一问题。

Method: SLOT在测试时通过优化轻量级样本特定参数向量，将其添加到最终隐藏层，并通过缓存最后一层特征实现高效适应。

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和模型上表现优异，例如Qwen2.5-7B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: SLOT通过样本特定优化显著提升语言模型性能，尤其在复杂指令任务上表现突出。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

Motivation: 现有推测解码框架依赖令牌级验证机制，导致接受长度不理想且候选令牌利用率低。

Method: 提出Traversal Verification算法，采用从叶子到根节点的遍历方式，验证整个令牌序列的接受性，保留潜在有效的子序列。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在不同大语言模型和任务中均能提高接受长度和吞吐量。

Conclusion: Traversal Verification在保证无损推理的同时，显著提升了推测解码的效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a promising approach for accelerating large language
models. The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the
output of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify
them in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or
rejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct
token trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their
reliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical
limitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from
that of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,
current verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by
layer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes
should be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative
candidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative
decoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm
through leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the
entire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves
potentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing
methods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained
through Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,
guaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.
Experimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks
show that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput
over existing methods

Abstract: Generative AI paraphrased text can be used for copyright infringement and the
AI paraphrased content can deprive substantial revenue from original content
creators. Despite this recent surge of malicious use of generative AI, there
are few academic publications that research this threat. In this article, we
demonstrate the ability of pattern-based similarity detection for AI

importantly, to identify that the source of infringement is the ChatGPT. The
proposed method is tested with a benchmark dataset specifically created for
this task that incorporates real articles from BBC, incorporating a total of
2,224 articles across five different news categories, as well as 2,224

Result: 实验显示Table-R1在多个基准数据集上平均提升14.36分，TARPO减少67.5%的响应令牌消耗。

Conclusion: Table-R1和TARPO显著提升了语言模型在表格推理中的效率和性能。

Abstract: Tables present unique challenges for language models due to their structured
row-column interactions, necessitating specialized approaches for effective
comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential
in table reasoning through prompting and techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT)
and program-of-thought (PoT), optimizing their performance for table question
answering remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce region-based
Table-R1, a novel reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM table
understanding by integrating region evidence into reasoning steps. Our method
employs Region-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (RE-SFT) to guide models in
identifying relevant table regions before generating answers, incorporating
textual, symbolic, and program-based reasoning. Additionally, Table-Aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (TARPO) introduces a mixed reward system to
dynamically balance region accuracy and answer correctness, with decaying
region rewards and consistency penalties to align reasoning steps. Experiments
show that Table-R1 achieves an average performance improvement of 14.36 points
across multiple base models on three benchmark datasets, even outperforming
baseline models with ten times the parameters, while TARPO reduces response
token consumption by 67.5% compared to GRPO, significantly advancing LLM
capabilities in efficient tabular reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以预定义RoPE的最佳频率缩放因子，因其搜索空间呈指数级增长。PSC旨在通过校准频率解决这一问题。

Method: 提出PSC模块，用于校准现有方法预定义的频率，并在多个模型和任务中验证其效果。

Result: 实验显示，启用PSC后，困惑度随上下文窗口（16k至64k）增大而显著降低，且方法具有广泛适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PSC是一种高效且通用的频率校准模块，能显著提升RoPE在扩展上下文窗口中的性能。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is an efficient position encoding approach
and is widely utilized in numerous large language models (LLMs). Recently, a
lot of methods have been put forward to further expand the context window based
on RoPE. The core concept of those methods is to predefine or search for a set
of factors to rescale the base frequencies of RoPE. Nevertheless, it is quite a
challenge for existing methods to predefine an optimal factor due to the
exponential search space. In view of this, we introduce PSC (Phase Shift
Calibration), a small module for calibrating the frequencies predefined by
existing methods. With the employment of PSC, we demonstrate that many existing
methods can be further enhanced, like PI, YaRN, and LongRoPE. We conducted
extensive experiments across multiple models and tasks. The results demonstrate
that (1) when PSC is enabled, the comparative reductions in perplexity increase
as the context window size is varied from 16k, to 32k, and up to 64k. (2) Our
approach is broadly applicable and exhibits robustness across a variety of
models and tasks. The code can be found at https://github.com/WNQzhu/PSC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个认知启发的框架LPLH，用于指导大型语言模型（LLM）系统性地学习和玩交互式小说游戏（IF游戏），强调人类化的叙事理解和决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注任务性能指标，忽视了人类对叙事和游戏逻辑的理解。LPLH框架旨在通过认知科学原则模拟人类玩家的行为。

Method: LPLH框架包含三个关键组件：结构化地图构建、动作学习和反馈驱动的经验分析，以优化LLM的决策过程。

Result: LPLH框架能够使LLM在IF游戏中表现出更接近人类的行为，提升对叙事意图和常识约束的理解。

Conclusion: LPLH为LLM在复杂文本环境中的游戏学习提供了新路径，强调了上下文感知和人类化决策的重要性。

Abstract: Interactive Fiction games (IF games) are where players interact through
natural language commands. While recent advances in Artificial Intelligence
agents have reignited interest in IF games as a domain for studying
decision-making, existing approaches prioritize task-specific performance
metrics over human-like comprehension of narrative context and gameplay logic.
This work presents a cognitively inspired framework that guides Large Language
Models (LLMs) to learn and play IF games systematically. Our proposed
**L**earning to **P**lay **L**ike **H**umans (LPLH) framework integrates three
key components: (1) structured map building to capture spatial and narrative
relationships, (2) action learning to identify context-appropriate commands,
and (3) feedback-driven experience analysis to refine decision-making over
time. By aligning LLMs-based agents' behavior with narrative intent and
commonsense constraints, LPLH moves beyond purely exploratory strategies to
deliver more interpretable, human-like performance. Crucially, this approach
draws on cognitive science principles to more closely simulate how human
players read, interpret, and respond within narrative worlds. As a result, LPLH
reframes the IF games challenge as a learning problem for LLMs-based agents,
offering a new path toward robust, context-aware gameplay in complex text-based
environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自我提问提升大语言模型理解能力的方法，并在计算机科学专利数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的内部知识通常难以访问和评估，尤其是在需要细粒度语义区分的领域。

Method: 采用自我提问策略，让模型生成并回答问题，同时结合外部科学文本检索。

Result: 自我提问显著提升了模型性能，尤其是在技术概念理解上，并揭示了跨模型协作的新策略。

Conclusion: 自我提问是提升LLM理解的实用机制，也是探究内部和外部知识组织的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly demonstrate signs of conceptual
understanding, yet much of their internal knowledge remains latent, loosely
structured, and difficult to access or evaluate. We propose self-questioning as
a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,
particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic
distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new
benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized
by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark
centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between
closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting
LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background
knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These
self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal
knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts
further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and
lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that
chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though
self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of
technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller
models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned
questions for mid-sized models than large models with better understanding do,
revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our
findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for
automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse
and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and
external knowledge are organized.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了远程监督命名实体识别（DS-NER）的有效性和鲁棒性，提出了一种新的噪声评估框架，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工标注方法成本高，远程监督方法虽便捷但噪声问题未充分研究。

Method: 结合规则方法和大型语言模型监督，提出分类噪声为未标注实体问题（UEP）和噪声实体问题（NEP）的框架。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了DS-NER中的噪声问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) has emerged as a cheap
and convenient alternative to traditional human annotation methods, enabling
the automatic generation of training data by aligning text with external
resources. Despite the many efforts in noise measurement methods, few works
focus on the latent noise distribution between different distant annotation
methods. In this work, we explore the effectiveness and robustness of DS-NER by
two aspects: (1) distant annotation techniques, which encompasses both
traditional rule-based methods and the innovative large language model
supervision approach, and (2) noise assessment, for which we introduce a novel
framework. This framework addresses the challenges by distinctly categorizing
them into the unlabeled-entity problem (UEP) and the noisy-entity problem
(NEP), subsequently providing specialized solutions for each. Our proposed
method achieves significant improvements on eight real-world distant
supervision datasets originating from three different data sources and
involving four distinct annotation techniques, confirming its superiority over
current state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 将任务输出建模为背景和观点摘要，定义两种标准化摘要模式，并引入首个高质量人工标注基准和分层评估框架。

Result: 评估12种LLMs发现：(1) LLMs在背景摘要检索、生成和观点摘要整合方面表现不佳；(2) 即使顶级LLMs的平均性能也低于69%；(3) 当前LLMs缺乏足够的自我评估和纠正能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在新任务中表现有限，需进一步提升背景知识整合和自我修正能力。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of LLMs on a new task that
requires combining discussion with background knowledge for summarization. This
aims to address the limitation of outside observer confusion in existing
dialogue summarization systems due to their reliance solely on discussion
information. To achieve this, we model the task output as background and
opinion summaries and define two standardized summarization patterns. To
support assessment, we introduce the first benchmark comprising high-quality
samples consistently annotated by human experts and propose a novel
hierarchical evaluation framework with fine-grained, interpretable metrics. We
evaluate 12 LLMs under structured-prompt and self-reflection paradigms. Our
findings reveal: (1) LLMs struggle with background summary retrieval,
generation, and opinion summary integration. (2) Even top LLMs achieve less
than 69% average performance across both patterns. (3) Current LLMs lack
adequate self-evaluation and self-correction capabilities for this task.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的KGQA方法忽视历史推理路径的利用，且复杂语义可能导致检索不准确的推理路径。

Method: RTSoG将问题分解为子问题，引入奖励引导的SC-MCTS检索加权推理路径，并堆叠生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了RTSoG的有效性，在GrailQA和WebQSP上分别提升了8.7%和7.0%。

Conclusion: RTSoG通过分解问题和奖励引导的路径检索，显著提升了KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) tasks, which aim to
find answers based on knowledge graphs (KGs) for natural language questions.
Existing LLMs-based KGQA methods typically follow the Graph Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (GraphRAG) paradigm, which first retrieves reasoning paths from the
large KGs, and then generates the answers based on them. However, these methods
emphasize the exploration of new optimal reasoning paths in KGs while ignoring
the exploitation of historical reasoning paths, which may lead to sub-optimal
reasoning paths. Additionally, the complex semantics contained in questions may
lead to the retrieval of inaccurate reasoning paths. To address these issues,
this paper proposes a novel and training-free framework for KGQA tasks called
Reward-guided Tree Search on Graph (RTSoG). RTSoG decomposes an original
question into a series of simpler and well-defined sub-questions to handle the
complex semantics. Then, a Self-Critic Monte Carlo Tree Search (SC-MCTS) guided
by a reward model is introduced to iteratively retrieve weighted reasoning
paths as contextual knowledge. Finally, it stacks the weighted reasoning paths
according to their weights to generate the final answers. Extensive experiments
on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RTSoG. Notably, it achieves
8.7\% and 7.0\% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the
GrailQA and the WebQSP respectively.

Method: 利用知识图谱提取多复杂度QA对，基于多跳检索、集合操作和答案多样性三个维度。

Result: 构建20,139对QA数据集，评估13种模型，发现其在集合比较和多跳推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 模型存在语义误解和隐式关系处理能力不足的系统性缺陷。

Abstract: The increasing context length of modern language models has created a need
for evaluating their ability to retrieve and process information across
extensive documents. While existing benchmarks test long-context capabilities,
they often lack a structured way to systematically vary question complexity. We
introduce KG-QAGen (Knowledge-Graph-based Question-Answer Generation), a
framework that (1) extracts QA pairs at multiple complexity levels (2) by
leveraging structured representations of financial agreements (3) along three
key dimensions -- multi-hop retrieval, set operations, and answer plurality --
enabling fine-grained assessment of model performance across controlled
difficulty levels. Using this framework, we construct a dataset of 20,139 QA
pairs (the largest number among the long-context benchmarks) and open-source a
part of it. We evaluate 13 proprietary and open-source LLMs and observe that
even the best-performing models are struggling with set-based comparisons and
multi-hop logical inference. Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes tied
to semantic misinterpretation and inability to handle implicit relations.

TL;DR: LM$^2$otifs是一种新型可解释框架，用于检测机器生成文本（MGT），结合图神经网络和解释性方法，提供多层次的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检测方法在解释性上的不足，特别是难以捕捉区分人类生成文本（HGT）和MGT的复杂词汇关系。

Method: 采用eXplainable Graph Neural Networks，分三阶段：文本转图表示词汇依赖、图神经网络预测、后处理提取可解释模式。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，提取的解释模式有效区分HGT和MGT，并揭示MGT的独特语言特征。

Conclusion: LM$^2$otifs不仅检测准确，还提供可解释性，为MGT检测领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The impressive ability of large language models to generate natural text
across various tasks has led to critical challenges in authorship
authentication. Although numerous detection methods have been developed to
differentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts
(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.
Traditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex
word relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,
we present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.
Inspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale
for the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks
to achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs
pipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs
based on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph
neural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability
method extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from
individual words to sentence structures. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the comparable performance of LM$^2$otifs. The
empirical evaluation of the extracted explainable motifs confirms their
effectiveness in differentiating HGT and MGT. Furthermore, qualitative analysis
reveals distinct and visible linguistic fingerprints characteristic of MGT.

Method: DS-ProGen整合骨架几何和表面化学及几何描述符，采用下一个氨基酸预测范式，生成功能相关且结构稳定的序列。

Result: 在PRIDE数据集上，DS-ProGen达到61.47%的恢复率，是目前最先进的方法，并在与多种生物伙伴的相互作用预测中表现优异。

Conclusion: DS-ProGen通过多模态结构编码在蛋白质设计中展现了协同优势，具有强大的功能保留能力。

Abstract: Inverse Protein Folding (IPF) is a critical subtask in the field of protein
design, aiming to engineer amino acid sequences capable of folding correctly
into a specified three-dimensional (3D) conformation. Although substantial
progress has been achieved in recent years, existing methods generally rely on
either backbone coordinates or molecular surface features alone, which
restricts their ability to fully capture the complex chemical and geometric
constraints necessary for precise sequence prediction. To address this
limitation, we present DS-ProGen, a dual-structure deep language model for
functional protein design, which integrates both backbone geometry and
surface-level representations. By incorporating backbone coordinates as well as
surface chemical and geometric descriptors into a next-amino-acid prediction
paradigm, DS-ProGen is able to generate functionally relevant and structurally
stable sequences while satisfying both global and local conformational
constraints. On the PRIDE dataset, DS-ProGen attains the current
state-of-the-art recovery rate of 61.47%, demonstrating the synergistic
advantage of multi-modal structural encoding in protein design. Furthermore,
DS-ProGen excels in predicting interactions with a variety of biological
partners, including ligands, ions, and RNA, confirming its robust functional
retention capabilities.

Result: ESC-Judge在探索、洞察和行动决策上与博士级标注者匹配率分别为85%、83%和86%。

Conclusion: ESC-Judge提供了一种高效、低成本且透明的情感支持AI评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly power mental-health chatbots, yet
the field still lacks a scalable, theory-grounded way to decide which model is
most effective to deploy. We present ESC-Judge, the first end-to-end evaluation
framework that (i) grounds head-to-head comparisons of emotional-support LLMs
in Clara Hill's established Exploration-Insight-Action counseling model,
providing a structured and interpretable view of performance, and (ii) fully
automates the evaluation pipeline at scale. ESC-Judge operates in three stages:
first, it synthesizes realistic help-seeker roles by sampling empirically
salient attributes such as stressors, personality, and life history; second, it
has two candidate support agents conduct separate sessions with the same role,
isolating model-specific strategies; and third, it asks a specialized judge LLM
to express pairwise preferences across rubric-anchored skills that span the
Exploration, Insight, and Action spectrum. In our study, ESC-Judge matched
PhD-level annotators on 85 percent of Exploration, 83 percent of Insight, and
86 percent of Action decisions, demonstrating human-level reliability at a
fraction of the cost. All code, prompts, synthetic roles, transcripts, and
judgment scripts are released to promote transparent progress in emotionally
supportive AI.

Abstract: Analysing the generalisation capabilities of relation extraction (RE) models
is crucial for assessing whether they learn robust relational patterns or rely
on spurious correlations. Our cross-dataset experiments find that RE models
struggle with unseen data, even within similar domains. Notably, higher
intra-dataset performance does not indicate better transferability, instead
often signaling overfitting to dataset-specific artefacts. Our results also
show that data quality, rather than lexical similarity, is key to robust
transfer, and the choice of optimal adaptation strategy depends on the quality
of data available: while fine-tuning yields the best cross-dataset performance
with high-quality data, few-shot in-context learning (ICL) is more effective
with noisier data. However, even in these cases, zero-shot baselines
occasionally outperform all cross-dataset results. Structural issues in RE
benchmarks, such as single-relation per sample constraints and non-standardised
negative class definitions, further hinder model transferability.

Abstract: Ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of human language. With
the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing ambiguity has become
even more critical due to their expanded capabilities and applications. In the
context of Conversational Question Answering (CQA), this paper explores the
definition, forms, and implications of ambiguity for language driven systems,
particularly in the context of LLMs. We define key terms and concepts,
categorize various disambiguation approaches enabled by LLMs, and provide a
comparative analysis of their advantages and disadvantages. We also explore
publicly available datasets for benchmarking ambiguity detection and resolution
techniques and highlight their relevance for ongoing research. Finally, we
identify open problems and future research directions, proposing areas for
further investigation. By offering a comprehensive review of current research
on ambiguities and disambiguation with LLMs, we aim to contribute to the
development of more robust and reliable language systems.

Result: TrafficSafe在F1分数上平均提升42%，发现酒驾是严重事故的主要因素，其贡献是其他行为的两倍。

Conclusion: TrafficSafe为交通安全研究提供了突破性进展，展示了如何将先进AI技术转化为实际应用。

Abstract: Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and
their contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic
safety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret
the complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including
numeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental
conditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to
capture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded
in these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical
crash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that
adapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based
reasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports
together with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle
information is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By
customizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves
a 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these
predictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe
Attribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling
conditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the
leading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related
behaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to
other driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal
features during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for
iterative performance improvements. The proposed TrafficSafe offers a
transformative leap in traffic safety research, providing a blueprint for
translating advanced AI technologies into responsible, actionable, and
life-saving outcomes.

Conclusion: 研究结果对版权案件有重要影响，但未明确支持任何一方，表明记忆化现象复杂且因模型和书籍而异。

Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make
sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models
(LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression. Drawing on adversarial
ML and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically
oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we
leverage a recent probabilistic extraction technique to extract pieces of the
Books3 dataset from 13 open-weight LLMs. Through numerous experiments, we show
that it's possible to extract substantial parts of at least some books from
different LLMs. This is evidence that the LLMs have memorized the extracted
text; this memorized content is copied inside the model parameters. But the
results are complicated: the extent of memorization varies both by model and by
book. With our specific experiments, we find that the largest LLMs don't
memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that
Llama 3.1 70B memorizes some books, like Harry Potter and 1984, almost
entirely. We discuss why our results have significant implications for
copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.

Result: 数据集标记准确性高，且提出的N1比率与专家确定的语序相关，可用于识别未收录语言的基本语序。

Conclusion: taggedPBC是推动跨语言研究的重要资源，已通过GitHub开放供研究和协作。

Abstract: Existing datasets available for crosslinguistic investigations have tended to
focus on large amounts of data for a small group of languages or a small amount
of data for a large number of languages. This means that claims based on these
datasets are limited in what they reveal about universal properties of the
human language faculty. While this has begun to change through the efforts of
projects seeking to develop tagged corpora for a large number of languages,
such efforts are still constrained by limits on resources. The current paper
reports on a large automatically tagged parallel dataset which has been
developed to partially address this issue. The taggedPBC contains more than
1,800 sentences of pos-tagged parallel text data from over 1,500 languages,
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates, dwarfing previously
available resources. The accuracy of tags in this dataset is shown to correlate
well with both existing SOTA taggers for high-resource languages (SpaCy,
Trankit) as well as hand-tagged corpora (Universal Dependencies Treebanks).
Additionally, a novel measure derived from this dataset, the N1 ratio,
correlates with expert determinations of word order in three typological
databases (WALS, Grambank, Autotyp) such that a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
trained on this feature can accurately identify basic word order for languages
not in those databases. While much work is still needed to expand and develop
this dataset, the taggedPBC is an important step to enable corpus-based
crosslinguistic investigations, and is made available for research and
collaboration via GitHub.

Conclusion: EPD为专利权利要求生成研究提供了更全面的数据支持，并揭示了未来研究需解决的实际挑战。

Abstract: Drafting patent claims is time-intensive, costly, and requires professional
skill. Therefore, researchers have investigated large language models (LLMs) to
assist inventors in writing claims. However, existing work has largely relied
on datasets from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). To
enlarge research scope regarding various jurisdictions, drafting conventions,
and legal standards, we introduce EPD, a European patent dataset. EPD presents
rich textual data and structured metadata to support multiple patent-related
tasks, including claim generation. This dataset enriches the field in three
critical aspects: (1) Jurisdictional diversity: Patents from different offices
vary in legal and drafting conventions. EPD fills a critical gap by providing a
benchmark for European patents to enable more comprehensive evaluation. (2)
Quality improvement: EPD offers high-quality granted patents with finalized and
legally approved texts, whereas others consist of patent applications that are
unexamined or provisional. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned on EPD
significantly outperform those trained on previous datasets and even GPT-4o in
claim quality and cross-domain generalization. (3) Real-world simulation: We
propose a difficult subset of EPD to better reflect real-world challenges of
claim generation. Results reveal that all tested LLMs perform substantially
worse on these challenging samples, which highlights the need for future
research.

Result: 两阶段分层大纲方法显著减少了语义失真，优于单阶段方法。

Conclusion: 研究为作者和研究人员提供了实证指导，帮助与LLMs合作创作百万字小说。

Abstract: Writing novels with Large Language Models (LLMs) raises a critical question:
how much human-authored outline is necessary to generate high-quality
million-word novels? While frameworks such as DOME, Plan&Write, and Long Writer
have improved stylistic coherence and logical consistency, they primarily
target shorter novels (10k--100k words), leaving ultra-long generation largely
unexplored. Drawing on insights from recent text compression methods like
LLMZip and LLM2Vec, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis that
quantifies distortion occurring when LLMs compress and reconstruct ultra-long
novels under varying compression-expansion ratios. We introduce a hierarchical
two-stage generation pipeline (outline -> detailed outline -> manuscript) and
find an optimal outline length that balances information preservation with
human effort. Through extensive experimentation with Chinese novels, we
establish that a two-stage hierarchical outline approach significantly reduces
semantic distortion compared to single-stage methods. Our findings provide
empirically-grounded guidance for authors and researchers collaborating with
LLMs to create million-word novels.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）如何处理非英语标记，并通过表示导向技术（在单层激活中添加学习向量）显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM领域进展显著，但非英语标记的处理机制仍不明确，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用表示导向技术，通过在单层激活中添加学习向量来优化模型性能。同时结合监督微调（SFT）和人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）提升多语言能力。

Result: 该方法性能与翻译基线相当，并优于现有提示优化方法。SFT和RLHF通过改变表示空间进一步增强了多语言能力。

Conclusion: 通过表示导向技术及高级训练方法（如SFT和RLHF），可以有效优化LLM的非英语处理能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how large language models (LLMS) process
non-English tokens within their layer representations, an open question despite
significant advancements in the field. Using representation steering,
specifically by adding a learned vector to a single model layer's activations,
we demonstrate that steering a single model layer can notably enhance
performance. Our analysis shows that this approach achieves results comparable
to translation baselines and surpasses state of the art prompt optimization
methods. Additionally, we highlight how advanced techniques like supervised
fine tuning (\textsc{sft}) and reinforcement learning from human feedback
(\textsc{rlhf}) improve multilingual capabilities by altering representation
spaces. We further illustrate how these methods align with our approach to
reshaping LLMS layer representations.

TL;DR: 提出CMLFormer模型，用于解决代码混合语言的结构挑战，通过多任务预训练策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准语言模型难以处理代码混合语言的结构问题，需专门设计模型。

Method: CMLFormer采用共享编码器和同步解码器交叉注意力的Transformer结构，预训练时引入新目标以捕捉语言切换行为。

Result: 在HASOC-2021基准测试中，CMLFormer的F1分数、精确度和准确率优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CMLFormer的架构和多任务预训练策略对代码混合语言建模有效。

Abstract: Code-mixed languages, characterized by frequent within-sentence language
transitions, present structural challenges that standard language models fail
to address. In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer
dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder
cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of
code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with
switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives
specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure,
and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1
score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021
benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show
that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity
to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling
code-mixed languages.

Motivation: 缺乏系统分析提示的框架，阻碍了对LLM行为的理解和性能优化。

Method: 提出PromptPrism分类法，从功能结构、语义组件和句法模式三个层次分析提示。

Result: 应用于提示优化、数据集分析和敏感性实验，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PromptPrism为提示的优化和分析提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Prompts are the interface for eliciting the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Understanding their structure and components is critical for
analyzing LLM behavior and optimizing performance. However, the field lacks a
comprehensive framework for systematic prompt analysis and understanding. We
introduce PromptPrism, a linguistically-inspired taxonomy that enables prompt
analysis across three hierarchical levels: functional structure, semantic
component, and syntactic pattern. We show the practical utility of PromptPrism
by applying it to three applications: (1) a taxonomy-guided prompt refinement
approach that automatically improves prompt quality and enhances model
performance across a range of tasks; (2) a multi-dimensional dataset profiling
method that extracts and aggregates structural, semantic, and syntactic
characteristics from prompt datasets, enabling comprehensive analysis of prompt
distributions and patterns; (3) a controlled experimental framework for prompt
sensitivity analysis by quantifying the impact of semantic reordering and
delimiter modifications on LLM performance. Our experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our taxonomy across these applications, demonstrating that
PromptPrism provides a foundation for refining, profiling, and analyzing
prompts.

Result: 实验表明AD-AGENT能生成可靠脚本并推荐高性能模型。

Conclusion: AD-AGENT为异常检测提供了高效工具，已开源以支持研究和应用。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in areas such as fraud detection, network
monitoring, and scientific research. However, the diversity of data modalities
and the increasing number of specialized AD libraries pose challenges for
non-expert users who lack in-depth library-specific knowledge and advanced
programming skills. To tackle this, we present AD-AGENT, an LLM-driven
multi-agent framework that turns natural-language instructions into fully
executable AD pipelines. AD-AGENT coordinates specialized agents for intent
parsing, data preparation, library and model selection, documentation mining,
and iterative code generation and debugging. Using a shared short-term
workspace and a long-term cache, the agents integrate popular AD libraries like
PyOD, PyGOD, and TSLib into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that
AD-AGENT produces reliable scripts and recommends competitive models across
libraries. The system is open-sourced to support further research and practical
applications in AD.

Motivation: 探索在有限计算资源下，传统方法（如TF-IDF）在多语言检索任务中的竞争力。

Method: 采用TF-IDF检索系统，测试不同向量维度和分词策略，最佳配置为15,000特征的词级分词。

Result: 在开发集上平均success@10得分为0.78，测试集上为0.69，表现优于高资源语言，但落后于顶级系统（0.96）。

Conclusion: 尽管神经网络在多语言检索中占主导，但优化后的传统方法（如TF-IDF）仍具竞争力，尤其适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the Duluth approach to the SemEval-2025 Task 7 on
Multilingual and Crosslingual Fact-Checked Claim Retrieval. We implemented a
TF-IDF-based retrieval system with experimentation on vector dimensions and
tokenization strategies. Our best-performing configuration used word-level
tokenization with a vocabulary size of 15,000 features, achieving an average
success@10 score of 0.78 on the development set and 0.69 on the test set across
ten languages. Our system showed stronger performance on higher-resource
languages but still lagged significantly behind the top-ranked system, which
achieved 0.96 average success@10. Our findings suggest that though advanced
neural architectures are increasingly dominant in multilingual retrieval tasks,
properly optimized traditional methods like TF-IDF remain competitive
baselines, especially in limited compute resource scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种句子级预归属步骤，用于提高大型语言模型（LLM）在科学领域中的可信度和可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成答案时缺乏可靠的来源归属，甚至可能提供错误的归属信息，这在科学和高风险场景中是不可接受的。

Method: 通过将句子分类为不可归属、可归属到单一引用和可归属到多个引用三类，选择适当的归属方法或跳过归属。

Result: 结果表明分类器适合此任务，并提供了HAGRID数据集的清洁版本和即用型端到端归属系统。

Conclusion: 预归属步骤能有效降低归属的计算复杂度，提升LLM输出的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science
domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical
challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often
generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect
attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes
settings, where traceability and accountability are non-negotiable. To be
reliable, attribution systems need high accuracy and retrieve data with short
lengths, i.e., attribute to a sentence within a document rather than a whole
document. We propose a sentence-level pre-attribution step for
Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that classify sentences into three
categories: not attributable, attributable to a single quote, and attributable
to multiple quotes. By separating sentences before attribution, a proper
attribution method can be selected for the type of sentence, or the attribution
can be skipped altogether. Our results indicate that classifiers are
well-suited for this task. In this work, we propose a pre-attribution step to
reduce the computational complexity of attribution, provide a clean version of
the HAGRID dataset, and provide an end-to-end attribution system that works out
of the box.

Motivation: 研究R1模型对政治敏感话题的审查行为，揭示其设计选择对透明度和偏见的影响。

Method: 构建大规模政治敏感提示集，分析R1的审查模式、一致性、触发条件及跨语言表现，并探索绕过审查的技术。

Result: R1的审查行为可能源于训练或对齐过程中的设计选择，引发对透明度和治理的担忧。

Conclusion: R1的审查行为揭示了语言模型部署中的潜在问题，需进一步关注透明度和治理。

Abstract: DeepSeek recently released R1, a high-performing large language model (LLM)
optimized for reasoning tasks. Despite its efficient training pipeline, R1
achieves competitive performance, even surpassing leading reasoning models like
OpenAI's o1 on several benchmarks. However, emerging reports suggest that R1
refuses to answer certain prompts related to politically sensitive topics in
China. While existing LLMs often implement safeguards to avoid generating
harmful or offensive outputs, R1 represents a notable shift - exhibiting
censorship-like behavior on politically charged queries. In this paper, we
investigate this phenomenon by first introducing a large-scale set of heavily
curated prompts that get censored by R1, covering a range of politically
sensitive topics, but are not censored by other models. We then conduct a
comprehensive analysis of R1's censorship patterns, examining their
consistency, triggers, and variations across topics, prompt phrasing, and
context. Beyond English-language queries, we explore censorship behavior in
other languages. We also investigate the transferability of censorship to
models distilled from the R1 language model. Finally, we propose techniques for
bypassing or removing this censorship. Our findings reveal possible additional
censorship integration likely shaped by design choices during training or
alignment, raising concerns about transparency, bias, and governance in
language model deployment.

Motivation: 现有知识编辑算法在传统指标上表现良好，但模型仍易生成原始知识，这种现象被称为“表面编辑”。研究旨在揭示其成因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过系统性评估，识别并验证了早期层残差流和后期层特定注意力模块的作用，尤其是某些注意力头及其输出矩阵的左奇异向量。

Result: 研究发现特定注意力头和左奇异向量与原始知识相关，并导致表面编辑现象。在表面遗忘任务中观察到类似模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识编辑中的表面编辑问题，并验证了其成因，为未来算法改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language
models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing
algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models
edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper
introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon.
Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant
challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify
and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual
stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific
attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later
layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices,
encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with
superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of
superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of
specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby
demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and
conclusions. Our code is available here.

Conclusion: 数据集和代码公开，便于后续研究。

Abstract: This paper addresses the gap in predicting turn-taking and backchannel
actions in human-machine conversations using multi-modal signals (linguistic,
acoustic, and visual). To overcome the limitation of existing datasets, we
propose an automatic data collection pipeline that allows us to collect and
annotate over 210 hours of human conversation videos. From this, we construct a
Multi-Modal Face-to-Face (MM-F2F) human conversation dataset, including over
1.5M words and corresponding turn-taking and backchannel annotations from
approximately 20M frames. Additionally, we present an end-to-end framework that
predicts the probability of turn-taking and backchannel actions from
multi-modal signals. The proposed model emphasizes the interrelation between
modalities and supports any combination of text, audio, and video inputs,
making it adaptable to a variety of realistic scenarios. Our experiments show
that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on turn-taking and
backchannel prediction tasks, achieving a 10\% increase in F1-score on
turn-taking and a 33\% increase on backchannel prediction. Our dataset and code
are publicly available online to ease of subsequent research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统因外部知识监督不足和参考不准确导致幻觉问题，需改进。

Result: 在多开放域QA基准测试中表现优于基线，减少幻觉并提升可靠性。

Conclusion: Know3-RAG通过结构化知识有效解决RAG系统的核心问题，提升生成内容的事实性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to impressive
progress in natural language generation, yet their tendency to produce
hallucinated or unsubstantiated content remains a critical concern. To improve
factual reliability, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external
knowledge during inference. However, existing RAG systems face two major
limitations: (1) unreliable adaptive control due to limited external knowledge
supervision, and (2) hallucinations caused by inaccurate or irrelevant
references. To address these issues, we propose Know3-RAG, a knowledge-aware
RAG framework that leverages structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs)
to guide three core stages of the RAG process, including retrieval, generation,
and filtering. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge-aware adaptive retrieval
module that employs KG embedding to assess the confidence of the generated
answer and determine retrieval necessity, a knowledge-enhanced reference
generation strategy that enriches queries with KG-derived entities to improve
generated reference relevance, and a knowledge-driven reference filtering
mechanism that ensures semantic alignment and factual accuracy of references.
Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that Know3-RAG
consistently outperforms strong baselines, significantly reducing
hallucinations and enhancing answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Shadow-FT框架，通过利用BASE模型的权重更新来微调INSTRUCT模型，显著提升性能，且无需额外参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接微调INSTRUCT模型效果有限甚至退化，而BASE模型与INSTRUCT模型权重高度相似，因此提出利用BASE模型进行间接微调。

Method: 通过微调BASE模型并将学习到的权重更新直接移植到INSTRUCT模型，实现Shadow-FT框架。

Result: 在19个基准测试中，Shadow-FT优于传统全参数和参数高效微调方法，且适用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和直接偏好优化（DPO）。

Conclusion: Shadow-FT是一种高效、易实现的微调方法，显著提升INSTRUCT模型性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) consistently benefit from further fine-tuning on
various tasks. However, we observe that directly tuning the INSTRUCT (i.e.,
instruction tuned) models often leads to marginal improvements and even
performance degeneration. Notably, paired BASE models, the foundation for these
INSTRUCT variants, contain highly similar weight values (i.e., less than 2% on
average for Llama 3.1 8B). Therefore, we propose a novel Shadow-FT framework to
tune the INSTRUCT models by leveraging the corresponding BASE models. The key
insight is to fine-tune the BASE model, and then directly graft the learned
weight updates to the INSTRUCT model. Our proposed Shadow-FT introduces no
additional parameters, is easy to implement, and significantly improves
performance. We conduct extensive experiments on tuning mainstream LLMs, such
as Qwen 3 and Llama 3 series, and evaluate them across 19 benchmarks covering
coding, reasoning, and mathematical tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
that Shadow-FT consistently outperforms conventional full-parameter and
parameter-efficient tuning approaches. Further analyses indicate that Shadow-FT
can be applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and combined with
direct preference optimization (DPO). Codes and weights are available at

Motivation: 传统链式思维（CoT）推理存在冗长输出和缺乏系统性的问题，树状思维（ToT）能更高效地探索和修剪推理路径。

Method: 提出ToTRL框架，结合规则奖励和谜题游戏训练LLMs，培养并行ToT推理能力。

Result: ToTQwen3-8B模型在复杂推理任务中表现出显著的性能提升和效率改进。

Conclusion: ToTRL框架有效提升了LLMs的推理能力，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant reasoning capabilities,
particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, which can be
elicited by reinforcement learning (RL). However, prolonged CoT reasoning
presents limitations, primarily verbose outputs due to excessive introspection.
The reasoning process in these LLMs often appears to follow a trial-and-error
methodology rather than a systematic, logical deduction. In contrast,
tree-of-thoughts (ToT) offers a conceptually more advanced approach by modeling
reasoning as an exploration within a tree structure. This reasoning structure
facilitates the parallel generation and evaluation of multiple reasoning
branches, allowing for the active identification, assessment, and pruning of
unproductive paths. This process can potentially lead to improved performance
and reduced token costs. Building upon the long CoT capability of LLMs, we
introduce tree-of-thoughts RL (ToTRL), a novel on-policy RL framework with a
rule-based reward. ToTRL is designed to guide LLMs in developing the parallel
ToT strategy based on the sequential CoT strategy. Furthermore, we employ LLMs
as players in a puzzle game during the ToTRL training process. Solving puzzle
games inherently necessitates exploring interdependent choices and managing
multiple constraints, which requires the construction and exploration of a
thought tree, providing challenging tasks for cultivating the ToT reasoning
capability. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our ToTQwen3-8B model,
trained with our ToTRL, achieves significant improvement in performance and
reasoning efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Result: 自动化与人工评估的词集高度一致（r=0.993），方法可靠且一致。

Conclusion: 该方法减少主观性，提升公平性、可扩展性和可重复性，适用于审计AI生成的教育内容。

Abstract: Recent advances in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have
transformed educational content creation, particularly in developing tutor
training materials. However, biases embedded in AI-generated content--such as
gender, racial, or national stereotypes--raise significant ethical and
educational concerns. Despite the growing use of GenAI, systematic methods for
detecting and evaluating such biases in educational materials remain limited.
This study proposes an automated bias assessment approach that integrates the
Contextualized Embedding Association Test with a prompt-engineered word
extraction method within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. We applied
this method to AI-generated texts used in tutor training lessons. Results show
a high alignment between the automated and manually curated word sets, with a
Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.993, indicating reliable and
consistent bias assessment. Our method reduces human subjectivity and enhances
fairness, scalability, and reproducibility in auditing GenAI-produced
educational content.

Method: 利用代码翻译任务训练LLMs，并引入OORL框架（结合on-policy和off-policy策略）和GEPO方法（基于IRs组的偏好优化）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了LLMs在多种编程语言代码基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过OORL和GEPO，LLMs能更好地理解代码功能及跨语言关系，缩小性能差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code
generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between
popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this
capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby
facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming
languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies.
Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a
rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this
coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference
Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO
trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be
guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones,
while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within
the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code
functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs
improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the
relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation
tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across
multiple programming languages.

*Yaxun Dai,Wenxuan Xie,Xialie Zhuang,Tianyu Yang,Yiying Yang,Haiqin Yang,Yuhang Zhao,Pingfu Chao,Wenhao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReEx-SQL提出了一种新的Text-to-SQL框架，通过执行反馈动态调整推理过程，显著提升了查询准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将执行反馈作为后处理信号，未能动态整合到生成过程中，限制了推理的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: ReEx-SQL采用执行感知的强化学习框架，结合结构化提示和逐步生成策略，动态调整推理路径。

Result: 在Spider和BIRD数据集上分别达到88.8%和64.9%，性能提升显著，推理时间减少51.9%。

Conclusion: ReEx-SQL通过动态整合执行反馈，显著提升了Text-to-SQL的性能和效率，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In Text-to-SQL, execution feedback is essential for guiding large language
models (LLMs) to reason accurately and generate reliable SQL queries. However,
existing methods treat execution feedback solely as a post-hoc signal for
correction or selection, failing to integrate it into the generation process.
This limitation hinders their ability to address reasoning errors as they
occur, ultimately reducing query accuracy and robustness. To address this
issue, we propose ReEx-SQL (Reasoning with Execution-Aware Reinforcement
Learning), a framework for Text-to-SQL that enables models to interact with the
database during decoding and dynamically adjust their reasoning based on
execution feedback. ReEx-SQL introduces an execution-aware reasoning paradigm
that interleaves intermediate SQL execution into reasoning paths, facilitating
context-sensitive revisions. It achieves this through structured prompts with
markup tags and a stepwise rollout strategy that integrates execution feedback
into each stage of generation. To supervise policy learning, we develop a
composite reward function that includes an exploration reward, explicitly
encouraging effective database interaction. Additionally, ReEx-SQL adopts a
tree-based decoding strategy to support exploratory reasoning, enabling dynamic
expansion of alternative reasoning paths. Notably, ReEx-SQL achieves 88.8% on
Spider and 64.9% on BIRD at the 7B scale, surpassing the standard reasoning
baseline by 2.7% and 2.6%, respectively. It also shows robustness, achieving
85.2% on Spider-Realistic with leading performance. In addition, its
tree-structured decoding improves efficiency and performance over linear
decoding, reducing inference time by 51.9% on the BIRD development set.

*Jitai Hao,Qiang Huang,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao,Zhaochun Ren,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRC是一种高效预训练方法，通过低秩投影矩阵实现软剪枝和激活对齐，显著提升小语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在剪枝、表示对齐和信息利用方面存在不足，LRC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用低秩投影矩阵压缩教师权重并对齐学生激活，包括FFN信号。

Result: LRC在仅使用20B tokens的情况下，性能匹配或超越现有方法，训练效率提升1000倍。

Conclusion: LRC是一种高效且性能优越的小语言模型训练方法。

Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even
with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing
work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning,
(2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of
informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To
address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient
pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence
with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices
that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation
clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the
teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the
need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source
teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of
tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency.

TL;DR: EAVIT框架结合本地可调优和在线黑盒LLMs，通过价值检测器和优化提示技术，高效准确地识别人文价值，减少输入令牌并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP模型（如BERT）在人文价值识别任务中表现不足，而在线LLMs处理长上下文时性能下降且计算成本高。

Method: 提出EAVIT框架，使用本地小模型生成初始价值估计，构建简洁提示供在线LLMs完成最终识别，并采用解释性训练和数据生成技术优化。

Result: EAVIT将输入令牌减少至1/6，性能优于传统NLP和其他LLM策略。

Conclusion: EAVIT为高效人文价值识别提供了一种创新解决方案，平衡了准确性和计算成本。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
various fields, including the identification and discovery of human values
within text data. While traditional NLP models, such as BERT, have been
employed for this task, their ability to represent textual data is
significantly outperformed by emerging LLMs like GPTs. However, the performance
of online LLMs often degrades when handling long contexts required for value
identification, which also incurs substantial computational costs. To address
these challenges, we propose EAVIT, an efficient and accurate framework for
human value identification that combines the strengths of both locally
fine-tunable and online black-box LLMs. Our framework employs a value detector
- a small, local language model - to generate initial value estimations. These
estimations are then used to construct concise input prompts for online LLMs,
enabling accurate final value identification. To train the value detector, we
introduce explanation-based training and data generation techniques
specifically tailored for value identification, alongside sampling strategies
to optimize the brevity of LLM input prompts. Our approach effectively reduces
the number of input tokens by up to 1/6 compared to directly querying online
LLMs, while consistently outperforming traditional NLP methods and other
LLM-based strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Decentralized Arena（dearena）的自动化框架，利用所有LLMs的集体智慧相互评估，解决了现有基准测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试方法存在饱和问题或依赖昂贵的人工评估，且自动化方法可能因依赖单一模型而产生偏见。

Method: dearena通过民主化、成对评估减少偏见，并采用粗到细的排名算法和自动问题选择策略提高效率。

Result: 在66个LLMs上的实验表明，dearena与人类判断的相关性高达97%，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: dearena为LLM评估提供了一种高效、低成本且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent explosion of large language models (LLMs), each with its own
general or specialized strengths, makes scalable, reliable benchmarking more
urgent than ever. Standard practices nowadays face fundamental trade-offs:
closed-ended question-based benchmarks (eg MMLU) struggle with saturation as
newer models emerge, while crowd-sourced leaderboards (eg Chatbot Arena) rely
on costly and slow human judges. Recently, automated methods (eg
LLM-as-a-judge) shed light on the scalability, but risk bias by relying on one
or a few "authority" models. To tackle these issues, we propose Decentralized
Arena (dearena), a fully automated framework leveraging collective intelligence
from all LLMs to evaluate each other. It mitigates single-model judge bias by
democratic, pairwise evaluation, and remains efficient at scale through two key
components: (1) a coarse-to-fine ranking algorithm for fast incremental
insertion of new models with sub-quadratic complexity, and (2) an automatic
question selection strategy for the construction of new evaluation dimensions.
Across extensive experiments across 66 LLMs, dearena attains up to 97%
correlation with human judgements, while significantly reducing the cost. Our
code and data will be publicly released on
https://github.com/maitrix-org/de-arena.

TL;DR: PsyMem框架通过结合细粒度心理属性和显式记忆控制，提升了角色扮演LLM的可靠性和表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在角色扮演中未能充分建模角色的内外维度，且记忆一致性不足，限制了应用可靠性。

Method: PsyMem整合26项心理指标补充角色描述，并通过记忆对齐训练实现动态记忆控制响应。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上训练的PsyMem-Qwen在人类相似性和角色保真度上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: PsyMem显著提升了角色扮演LLM的性能，为可信社交模拟等应用提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual
descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and
extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character
memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation
without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two
issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as
trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem,
a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and
explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual
descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character.
Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains
the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic
memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962
dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen,
outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in
human-likeness and character fidelity.

Motivation: LLMs在任意风格转换中面临依赖手动提示和固有风格偏见的挑战，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SynDec方法，通过选择代表性样本、四维风格分析和候选重排合成提示，并在解码阶段通过概率对比增强效果。

Result: SynDec在六项基准测试中的五项优于现有方法，例如在现代到伊丽莎白英语转换中准确率提升9%。

Conclusion: SynDec通过自动提示合成和增强解码效果，显著提升了LLMs在风格转换中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as dominant forces for textual
style transfer. However, for arbitrary style transfer, LLMs face two key
challenges: (1) considerable reliance on manually-constructed prompts and (2)
rigid stylistic biases inherent in LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel
Synthesize-then-Decode (SynDec) approach, which automatically synthesizes
high-quality prompts and amplifies their roles during decoding process.
Specifically, our approach synthesizes prompts by selecting representative
few-shot samples, conducting a four-dimensional style analysis, and reranking
the candidates. At LLM decoding stage, the TST effect is amplified by
maximizing the contrast in output probabilities between scenarios with and
without the synthesized prompt, as well as between prompts and negative
samples. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show that SynDec
outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on five out of six
benchmarks (e.g., achieving up to a 9\% increase in accuracy for
modern-to-Elizabethan English transfer). Detailed ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of SynDec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种对比提示（CP）方法，通过引入辅助提示来优化句子嵌入，避免非核心语义信息的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，最后一个标记仍包含过多非必要信息（如停用词），限制了嵌入能力。

Method: 采用对比提示（CP）方法，通过辅助提示引导核心语义编码。

Result: 在语义文本相似性（STS）和分类任务中，CP显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: CP是一种即插即用的推理时干预方法，适用于多种基于提示的方法。

Abstract: Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning.
Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode
the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last
token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of
non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity.
To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) method that introduces an
extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with
the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core
semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a
plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with
various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across
different LLMs. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zifengcheng/CP.

Motivation: 无人机视觉与语言导航在灾害响应、物流配送和城市检查等应用中至关重要，但现有方法在多模态融合、泛化能力和可解释性方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出FlightGPT框架，采用两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）和基于复合奖励的组相对策略优化（GRPO），并结合链式思维（CoT）推理机制。

Result: 在CityNav数据集上，FlightGPT在未见环境中成功率比最强基线高9.22%，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: FlightGPT通过改进的训练和推理机制，显著提升了无人机VLN的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is vital
for applications such as disaster response, logistics delivery, and urban
inspection. However, existing methods often struggle with insufficient
multimodal fusion, weak generalization, and poor interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose FlightGPT, a novel UAV VLN framework built upon
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with powerful multimodal perception capabilities.
We design a two-stage training pipeline: first, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
using high-quality demonstrations to improve initialization and structured
reasoning; then, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, guided by
a composite reward that considers goal accuracy, reasoning quality, and format
compliance, to enhance generalization and adaptability. Furthermore, FlightGPT
introduces a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning mechanism to improve
decision interpretability. Extensive experiments on the city-scale dataset
CityNav demonstrate that FlightGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across
all scenarios, with a 9.22\% higher success rate than the strongest baseline in
unseen environments. Our implementation is publicly available.

Motivation: 探索法律合同的结构对LLM处理的影响，以及如何通过输入结构和提示工程优化模型表现。

Method: 比较不同输入格式（如结构化文本、OCR提取文本、Markdown）和提示设计对GPT-4o和GPT-4.1在法律问答任务中的准确率影响。

Result: GPT-4o对输入结构变化更具鲁棒性但整体表现较差；GPT-4.1对结构敏感，优化结构和提示可提升准确率20-33个百分点。

Conclusion: 输入结构优化和提示设计对LLM性能至关重要，尤其在高风险法律应用中。

Abstract: Legal contracts possess an inherent, semantically vital structure (e.g.,
sections, clauses) that is crucial for human comprehension but whose impact on
LLM processing remains under-explored. This paper investigates the effects of
explicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of
GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the
CUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats:
well-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of
line breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by
GPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o
Vision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we
assess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and
explicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our
findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations
in input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's
performance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal
results (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original
CUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by
~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and
an advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an
additional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the
highest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall
exact-match accuracy). This research empirically demonstrates that while newer
models exhibit greater resilience, careful input structuring and strategic
prompt design remain critical for optimizing the performance of LLMs, and can
significantly affect outcomes in high-stakes legal applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于RAG的反向再识别方法，用于测试去标识化方法的鲁棒性，结果显示80%的去标识化文本可被成功恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究去标识化方法的鲁棒性，验证个人信息是否容易被重新识别。

Method: 采用两步法：检索器从背景知识库中选择相关段落，填充模型推断被掩码的原始内容。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，80%的掩码文本可被恢复，再识别准确率随背景知识增加而提高。

Conclusion: 去标识化方法可能不够鲁棒，背景知识越多，再识别成功率越高。

Abstract: Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be
de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of
personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to
uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the
robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired
approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a
database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which
personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two
steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed
relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an
infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span.
This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the
re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and
clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text
spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy
increases along with the level of background knowledge.

Result: 模型在需要多步法律推理的开放性问题中表现较差，但数据集能有效区分不同能力的模型。

Conclusion: LEXam为评估法律推理质量提供了可扩展的方法，超越了简单的准确率指标。

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models
(LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. We introduce LEXam, a
novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses
across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law
exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended
questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the
open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected
legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule
application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions
present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably
struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal
reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in
differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Adopting an
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate
how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and
accurately. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal
reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. Project page:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图辅助提示（GAP）的框架，用于对话式药物推荐，解决了大型语言模型在医疗对话中忽略细节和生成非事实性回应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗对话系统中的药物推荐需要关注患者与医生的交互细节，而现有基于电子健康记录的方法无法满足这一需求。大型语言模型虽能提供建议，但可能忽略关键信息或生成不准确回应。

Method: GAP框架通过从对话中提取医疗概念和状态构建患者中心图，结合外部知识图谱生成查询和提示，以减少非事实性回应。

Result: 实验表明，GAP在对话式药物推荐任务中表现优异，并在动态诊断访谈中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: GAP框架有效提升了对话式药物推荐的准确性和安全性，为医疗对话系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare
domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue
systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic
health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require
research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is
crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models
(LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret
patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication
recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a
multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or
connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate
suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a
lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain.
To address these challenges, we propose a \textbf{G}raph-\textbf{A}ssisted
\textbf{P}rompts (\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication
recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from
dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe
the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external
medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus
retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual
responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation
dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario,
dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
competitive performance when compared with strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs能够通过预训练模拟人类的System 2推理，但语言建模容易吸收语言偏差，导致推理过程偏离真实的思维链。

Method: 提出LoT技术，通过调整表达顺序和使用的标记来减少偏差，而非直接从部分信息中引出思维链。

Result: LoT显著减少了LLMs中的语言建模偏差，并在多种推理任务中提升了性能。

Conclusion: LoT是一种简单但有效的技术，能够缩小语言与思维建模之间的差距，提升LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: System 2 reasoning is one of the defining characteristics of intelligence,
which requires slow and logical thinking. Human conducts System 2 reasoning via
the language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal
sequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that
System 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs)
pre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show
that there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.
As language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,
modeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated
from the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will
mislead the eliciting of "thoughts" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of
the premise. To this end, we propose a new prompt technique termed
Language-of-Thoughts (LoT) to demonstrate and alleviate this gap. Instead of
directly eliciting the chain of thoughts from partial information, LoT
instructs LLMs to adjust the order and token used for the expressions of all
the relevant information. We show that the simple strategy significantly
reduces the language modeling biases in LLMs and improves the performance of
LLMs across a variety of reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 新方法有效平衡token梯度，提升RL训练效率，显著优化LLM表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with recent innovations
such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) demonstrating exceptional
effectiveness. In this study, we identify a critical yet underexplored issue in
RL training: low-probability tokens disproportionately influence model updates
due to their large gradient magnitudes. This dominance hinders the effective
learning of high-probability tokens, whose gradients are essential for LLMs'
performance but are substantially suppressed. To mitigate this interference, we
propose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token
Isolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from
low-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by
high-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens
with varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.
Experimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the
performance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K
Logic Puzzle reasoning tasks. Our implementation is available at

*Jeffrey T. H. Wong,Cheng Zhang,Xinye Cao,Pedro Gimenes,George A. Constantinides,Wayne Luk,Yiren Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为A³的后训练低秩近似框架，用于压缩大型语言模型，解决了现有方法的局限性，并通过实验验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩近似方法未考虑Transformer架构特性，且分解权重矩阵会引入运行时开销，导致性能不如其他压缩技术。

Method: A³将Transformer层分为QK、OV和MLP三个功能组件，为每个组件提供分析解以减少隐藏维度大小，同时最小化功能损失。

Result: A³在相同计算和内存减少预算下，性能优于现有技术（如LLaMA 3.1-70B的困惑度从7.87降至4.69）。

Conclusion: A³不仅直接减少模型大小和计算开销，还提供了从单层损失优化到端到端性能改进的新思路。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable performance; however,
their massive parameter counts make deployment highly expensive. Low-rank
approximation offers a promising compression solution, yet existing approaches
have two main limitations: (1) They focus on minimizing the output error of
individual linear layers, without considering the architectural characteristics
of Transformers, and (2) they decompose a large weight matrix into two small
low-rank matrices. Consequently, these methods often fall short compared to
other compression techniques like pruning and quantization, and introduce
runtime overhead such as the extra GEMM kernel launches for decomposed small
matrices. To address these limitations, we propose $\tt A^\tt 3$, a
post-training low-rank approximation framework. $\tt A^\tt 3$ splits a
Transformer layer into three functional components, namely $\tt QK$, $\tt OV$,
and $\tt MLP$. For each component, $\tt A^\tt 3$ provides an analytical
solution that reduces the hidden dimension size inside each component while
minimizing the component's functional loss ($\it i.e.$, error in attention
scores, attention outputs, and MLP outputs). This approach directly reduces
model sizes, KV cache sizes, and FLOPs without introducing any runtime
overheads. In addition, it provides a new narrative in advancing the
optimization problem from singular linear layer loss optimization toward
improved end-to-end performance. Through extensive experiments, we show that
$\tt A^\tt 3$ maintains superior performance compared to SoTAs. For example,
under the same reduction budget in computation and memory, our low-rank
approximated LLaMA 3.1-70B achieves a perplexity of 4.69 on WikiText-2,
outperforming the previous SoTA's 7.87 by 3.18. We also demonstrate the
versatility of $\tt A^\tt 3$, including KV cache compression, quantization, and
mixed-rank assignments for enhanced performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用神经方法为四种Nguni语言构建形态学标注器，比较了从头训练的序列标注器和微调预训练模型的表现，发现神经标注器显著优于基于规则的基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形态学解析对于黏着语（如Nguni语言）尤为困难，需要分解词为语素并标注其语法角色，因此探索神经方法的应用。

Method: 采用两种神经方法：从头训练的序列标注器（LSTM和神经CRF）和微调预训练语言模型，并与传统基于规则的解析器对比。

Result: 神经标注器明显优于基于规则的基线，从头训练的模型通常优于预训练模型，且不同上游分割器和输入特征对结果有影响。

Conclusion: 神经标注器结合现有形态学分割器对Nguni语言是可行的，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Morphological parsing is the task of decomposing words into morphemes, the
smallest units of meaning in a language, and labelling their grammatical roles.
It is a particularly challenging task for agglutinative languages, such as the
Nguni languages of South Africa, which construct words by concatenating
multiple morphemes. A morphological parsing system can be framed as a pipeline
with two separate components, a segmenter followed by a tagger. This paper
investigates the use of neural methods to build morphological taggers for the
four Nguni languages. We compare two classes of approaches: training neural
sequence labellers (LSTMs and neural CRFs) from scratch and finetuning
pretrained language models. We compare performance across these two categories,
as well as to a traditional rule-based morphological parser. Neural taggers
comfortably outperform the rule-based baseline and models trained from scratch
tend to outperform pretrained models. We also compare parsing results across
different upstream segmenters and with varying linguistic input features. Our
findings confirm the viability of employing neural taggers based on
pre-existing morphological segmenters for the Nguni languages.

TL;DR: GuRE是一种基于大型语言模型的查询重写方法，用于解决法律段落检索中的词汇不匹配问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律段落检索（LPR）系统因词汇不匹配问题未被充分探索，GuRE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成重写查询，以减少词汇不匹配。

Result: GuRE在检索性能上显著优于基线方法，且适用于不同检索器。

Conclusion: GuRE比直接微调检索器更适合实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners
save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored
avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the
query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the
generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for
query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target
passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE
significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner,
outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different
training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more
suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes
are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.

TL;DR: MA-COIR是一个将概念识别重新定义为索引-识别任务的框架，通过语义搜索索引（ssIDs）提高识别效率，适用于生物医学领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念识别方法无法捕捉文本中未明确提及的复杂概念，限制了知识图谱构建和本体细化。

Method: 采用预训练的BART模型，结合小数据集微调和LLM生成的查询与合成数据，优化低资源环境下的识别效果。

Result: 在CDR、HPO和HOIP三个场景中，MA-COIR能有效识别显式和隐式概念，无需推理时的提及级标注。

Conclusion: MA-COIR为生物医学领域的本体驱动概念识别提供了高效且低资源需求的解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing biomedical concepts in the text is vital for ontology refinement,
knowledge graph construction, and concept relationship discovery. However,
traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention
identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in
the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that
reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning
semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in
ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained
BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces
computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts.
Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and
synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental
results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of
MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for
mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept
recognition in biomedical domain applications. Our code and constructed data
are available at https://github.com/sl-633/macoir-master.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种减少Whisper在非语音段幻觉问题的新方法，通过分析并微调特定自注意力头，显著降低了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whisper在非语音段存在幻觉问题，限制了其在复杂工业场景的应用。

Method: 通过头掩码技术分析Whisper解码器中各自注意力头对幻觉的贡献，并微调关键头。

Result: 仅微调3个头即可减少80%的非语音幻觉，且WER仅增加0.1%。

Conclusion: Calm-Whisper模型显著提升了Whisper在非语音段的可靠性，实用性高。

Abstract: OpenAI's Whisper has achieved significant success in Automatic Speech
Recognition. However, it has consistently been found to exhibit hallucination
issues, particularly in non-speech segments, which limits its broader
application in complex industrial settings.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel method to reduce Whisper's hallucination
on non-speech segments without using any pre- or post-possessing techniques.
Specifically, we benchmark the contribution of each self-attentional head in
the Whisper-large-v3 decoder to the hallucination problem by performing a
head-wise mask. Our findings reveal that only 3 of the 20 heads account for
over 75% of the hallucinations on the UrbanSound dataset. We then fine-tune
these three crazy heads using a collection of non-speech data. The results show
that our best fine-tuned model, namely Calm-Whisper, achieves over 80%
reduction in non-speech hallucination with only less than 0.1% WER degradation
on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other.

Abstract: The continued rise of neural networks and large language models in the more
recent past has altered the natural language processing landscape, enabling new
approaches towards typical language tasks and achieving mainstream success.
Despite the huge success of large language models, many disadvantages still
remain and through this work we assess the state of the art in five application
scenarios with a particular focus on the future perspectives and sensible
application scenarios of traditional and older approaches and techniques.
  In this paper we survey recent publications in the application scenarios
classification, information and relation extraction, text simplification as
well as text summarization. After defining our terminology, i.e., which
features are characteristic for traditional techniques in our interpretation
for the five scenarios, we survey if such traditional approaches are still
being used, and if so, in what way they are used. It turns out that all five
application scenarios still exhibit traditional models in one way or another,
as part of a processing pipeline, as a comparison/baseline to the core model of
the respective paper, or as the main model(s) of the paper. For the complete

Result: 深度学习系统和eSpeak系统的同形异义词消歧准确率提高了约30%。

Conclusion: 通过离线数据集和快速规则方法，有效解决了同形异义词消歧问题，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Homograph disambiguation remains a significant challenge in
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, especially for low-resource languages.
This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph
datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation
strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this
paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for
constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset
generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying
it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian.
Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to
inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for
latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end,
we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a
fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate
30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep
learning-based and eSpeak systems.

Result: 零样本LLMs与传统微调模型竞争，指令调优后开源LLMs表现优于零样本LLMs（包括GPT-4），但事实性问题突出。

Conclusion: LLMs在M2MS任务中潜力显著，但需解决事实性问题，未来研究应关注如何控制事实错误。

Abstract: Many-to-many summarization (M2MS) aims to process documents in any language
and generate the corresponding summaries also in any language. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them
the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a
systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first
reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The
reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six
languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark
18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned
traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our
experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with
fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can
significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs
(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we
demonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'
general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation,
LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might
intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when
building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worth noting in future
research.

Motivation: 现有的大型推理模型在机器翻译中主要集中在高资源语言（如英语和中文），且奖励建模方法未能充分发挥强化学习的潜力。

Method: 设计了一种新的奖励建模方法，通过比较策略模型与强大LRM（如DeepSeek-R1-671B）的翻译结果，量化比较以提供奖励。使用Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct作为主干模型，并扩展到11种语言的多语言设置。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级奖励建模，该方法成功将单方向的强大翻译能力扩展到多语言任务，展示了强化学习在机器翻译中的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, has shown impressive capabilities in complex
problems, e.g., mathematics and coding. Some pioneering studies attempt to
bring the success of LRMs in neural machine translation (MT). They try to build
LRMs with deep reasoning MT ability via reinforcement learning (RL). Despite
some progress that has been made, these attempts generally focus on several
high-resource languages, e.g., English and Chinese, leaving the performance on
other languages unclear. Besides, the reward modeling methods in previous work
do not fully unleash the potential of reinforcement learning in MT. In this
work, we first design a new reward modeling method that compares the
translation results of the policy MT model with a strong LRM (i.e.,
DeepSeek-R1-671B), and quantifies the comparisons to provide rewards.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the reward modeling method.
Using Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, the trained model achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance in literary translation, and outperforms strong
LRMs including OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeeK-R1. Furthermore, we extend our method to
the multilingual settings with 11 languages. With a carefully designed
lightweight reward modeling in RL, we can simply transfer the strong MT ability
from a single direction into multiple (i.e., 90) translation directions and
achieve impressive multilingual MT performance.

Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional
correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a
single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the
first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of
LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby,
and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert
solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on
EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they
consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient
LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human
efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show
better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and
Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient
than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into
LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse
languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and

Motivation: 提升机场自动化水平，解决机场术语和动态问题查询的挑战。

Method: 实现三种RAG方法（传统RAG、SQL RAG、Graph RAG）并比较其性能。

Result: Graph RAG准确率最高（91.49%），SQL RAG次之（80.85%），传统RAG最低（84.84%）但幻觉较多。

Conclusion: SQL RAG和Graph RAG更适合机场环境，因其幻觉少且能处理复杂查询。

Abstract: Airports from the top 20 in terms of annual passengers are highly dynamic
environments with thousands of flights daily, and they aim to increase the
degree of automation. To contribute to this, we implemented a Conversational AI
system that enables staff in an airport to communicate with flight information
systems. This system not only answers standard airport queries but also
resolves airport terminology, jargon, abbreviations, and dynamic questions
involving reasoning. In this paper, we built three different
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods, including traditional RAG, SQL
RAG, and Knowledge Graph-based RAG (Graph RAG). Experiments showed that
traditional RAG achieved 84.84% accuracy using BM25 + GPT-4 but occasionally
produced hallucinations, which is risky to airport safety. In contrast, SQL RAG
and Graph RAG achieved 80.85% and 91.49% accuracy respectively, with
significantly fewer hallucinations. Moreover, Graph RAG was especially
effective for questions that involved reasoning. Based on our observations, we
thus recommend SQL RAG and Graph RAG are better for airport environments, due
to fewer hallucinations and the ability to handle dynamic questions.

Conclusion: 研究为构建更鲁棒、可解释的媒体偏见检测系统提供了基础，未来可探索上下文感知建模和偏见中和等方向。

Abstract: Media bias detection is a critical task in ensuring fair and balanced
information dissemination, yet it remains challenging due to the subjectivity
of bias and the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this work, we
perform sentence-level bias classification by fine-tuning a RoBERTa-based model
on the expert-annotated BABE dataset. Using McNemar's test and the 5x2
cross-validation paired t-test, we show statistically significant improvements
in performance when comparing our model to a domain-adaptively pre-trained
DA-RoBERTa baseline. Furthermore, attention-based analysis shows that our model
avoids common pitfalls like oversensitivity to politically charged terms and
instead attends more meaningfully to contextually relevant tokens. For a
comprehensive examination of media bias, we present a pipeline that combines
our model with an already-existing bias-type classifier. Our method exhibits
good generalization and interpretability, despite being constrained by
sentence-level analysis and dataset size because of a lack of larger and more
advanced bias corpora. We talk about context-aware modeling, bias
neutralization, and advanced bias type classification as potential future
directions. Our findings contribute to building more robust, explainable, and
socially responsible NLP systems for media bias detection.

Conclusion: topicwizard为模型无关的主题模型解释提供了有效工具，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Topic models are statistical tools that allow their users to gain qualitative
and quantitative insights into the contents of textual corpora without the need
for close reading. They can be applied in a wide range of settings from
discourse analysis, through pretraining data curation, to text filtering. Topic
models are typically parameter-rich, complex models, and interpreting these
parameters can be challenging for their users. It is typical practice for users
to interpret topics based on the top 10 highest ranking terms on a given topic.
This list-of-words approach, however, gives users a limited and biased picture
of the content of topics. Thoughtful user interface design and visualizations
can help users gain a more complete and accurate understanding of topic models'
output. While some visualization utilities do exist for topic models, these are
typically limited to a certain type of topic model. We introduce topicwizard, a
framework for model-agnostic topic model interpretation, that provides
intuitive and interactive tools that help users examine the complex semantic
relations between documents, words and topics learned by topic models.

Abstract: The scope of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation
(IWSLT) has recently broadened beyond traditional Speech Translation (ST) to
encompass a wider array of tasks, including Speech Question Answering and
Summarization. This shift is partly driven by the growing capabilities of
modern systems, particularly with the success of Large Language Models (LLMs).
In this paper, we present the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology's submissions
for the Offline ST and Instruction Following (IF) tracks, where we leverage
LLMs to enhance performance across all tasks. For the Offline ST track, we
propose a pipeline that employs multiple automatic speech recognition systems,
whose outputs are fused using an LLM with document-level context. This is
followed by a two-step translation process, incorporating additional refinement
step to improve translation quality. For the IF track, we develop an end-to-end
model that integrates a speech encoder with an LLM to perform a wide range of

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯推理和非平稳马尔可夫决策过程的解释生成框架，用于动态适应用户特征和交互上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释生成需要根据用户特征和上下文动态调整策略，但现有对话系统难以实现这一点。

Method: 采用贝叶斯推理更新用户模型，结合非平稳马尔可夫决策过程动态调整解释策略。

Result: 实验表明，框架能有效适应不同用户（包括反馈行为变化的用户），生成个性化解释策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为可解释AI和对话系统提供了动态适应的潜力。

Abstract: Adapting to the addressee is crucial for successful explanations, yet poses
significant challenges for dialogsystems. We adopt the approach of treating
explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal
strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the
interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track
the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally
defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the
dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently
best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to
continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a
non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the
partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five
simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to
different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The
results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for
different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve
explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于多模态的青少年自杀风险评估方法，结合语音转录、语言和音频嵌入，以及手工声学特征，探索了三种融合策略，发现加权注意力效果最佳，但泛化能力仍需提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年自杀风险评估的需求推动了多模态方法的研究，旨在通过语音和语言特征提高评估的准确性。

Method: 结合WhisperX自动转录、中文RoBERTa语言嵌入、WavLM音频嵌入及手工声学特征，探索了早期拼接、模态特定处理和加权注意力三种融合策略。

Result: 加权注意力策略在开发集上达到69%准确率，但开发集与测试集间的性能差距表明泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调了优化嵌入表示和融合机制的重要性，以提升分类可靠性，尤其是在MINI-KID框架下。

Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge conveys the need for speech-based suicide
risk assessment in adolescents. This study investigates a multimodal approach
for this challenge, integrating automatic transcription with WhisperX,
linguistic embeddings from Chinese RoBERTa, and audio embeddings from WavLM.
Additionally, handcrafted acoustic features -- including MFCCs, spectral
contrast, and pitch-related statistics -- were incorporated. We explored three
fusion strategies: early concatenation, modality-specific processing, and
weighted attention with mixup regularization. Results show that weighted
attention provided the best generalization, achieving 69% accuracy on the
development set, though a performance gap between development and test sets
highlights generalization challenges. Our findings, strictly tied to the
MINI-KID framework, emphasize the importance of refining embedding
representations and fusion mechanisms to enhance classification reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在处理数字序列时忽略了其连贯结构，导致性能不足。

Method: 引入NTIL损失函数，结合Earth Mover's Distance（EMD）和序列级惩罚，优化数字序列生成。

Result: 实验表明NTIL显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: NTIL有效解决了数字序列生成中的结构连贯性问题，适用于LLMs/MLLMs。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have become the de facto choice for sequence generation
tasks, but standard approaches treat digits as independent tokens and apply
cross-entropy loss, overlooking the coherent structure of numerical sequences.
This paper introduces Numerical Token Integrity Loss (NTIL) to address this
gap. NTIL operates at two levels: (1) token-level, where it extends the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) to preserve ordinal relationships between numerical
values, and (2) sequence-level, where it penalizes the overall discrepancy
between the predicted and actual sequences. This dual approach improves
numerical prediction and integrates effectively with LLMs/MLLMs. Extensive
experiments show significant performance improvements with NTIL.

<details>

Motivation: 当前语言模型在系统泛化中表现不佳，缺乏衡量问题难度的明确方法。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过序列到序列任务中组件部分的熵来量化问题难度，并测试不同模型架构的性能。

Result: 模型性能与熵相关，高熵下无需内置先验即可成功，低熵可作为稳健系统泛化的目标。

Conclusion: 系统泛化与信息效率相关，低熵表现可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Systematic generalization remains challenging for current language models,
which are known to be both sensitive to semantically similar permutations of
the input and to struggle with known concepts presented in novel contexts.
Although benchmarks exist for assessing compositional behavior, it is unclear
how to measure the difficulty of a systematic generalization problem. In this
work, we show how one aspect of systematic generalization can be described by
the entropy of the distribution of component parts in the training data. We
formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and
find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the
entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency,
and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even
without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target
for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization.

Motivation: 解决先前研究关于语言多样性在LLM微调中效果不一致的问题。

Method: 通过132个翻译方向的受控微调实验，系统分析语言多样性的影响。

Result: 语言多样性提升翻译质量，但效果在达到阈值后不再增加；多样性促使模型生成更语言无关的表征。

Conclusion: 语言多样性在微调中具有积极作用，但其效果有上限，表征适应性是关键因素。

Abstract: Prior research diverges on language diversity in LLM fine-tuning: Some
studies report benefits while others find no advantages. Through controlled
fine-tuning experiments across 132 translation directions, we systematically
resolve these disparities. We find that expanding language diversity during
fine-tuning improves translation quality for both unsupervised and --
surprisingly -- supervised pairs, despite less diverse models being fine-tuned
exclusively on these supervised pairs. However, benefits plateau or decrease
beyond a certain diversity threshold. We show that increased language diversity
creates more language-agnostic representations. These representational
adaptations help explain the improved performance in models fine-tuned with
greater diversity.

Motivation: 当前多模态研究关注结合文本与其他模态（如视觉和音频），但LALMs在推理任务上的表现尚未充分评估，因此需要专门的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 提出TREA数据集，用于评估LALMs的时间推理能力；同时设计了一种不确定性度量方法，衡量模型对输入语义相同扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 开源LALMs在TREA数据集上的表现一致低于人类；不确定性度量与准确性不相关，表明需要更全面的评估。

Conclusion: LALMs在时间推理任务上仍有提升空间，不确定性度量可作为补充评估指标，未来需更全面的评估方法。

Abstract: The popular success of text-based large language models (LLM) has streamlined
the attention of the multimodal community to combine other modalities like
vision and audio along with text to achieve similar multimodal capabilities. In
this quest, large audio language models (LALMs) have to be evaluated on
reasoning related tasks which are different from traditional classification or
generation tasks. Towards this goal, we propose a novel dataset called temporal
reasoning evaluation of audio (TREA).
  We benchmark open-source LALMs and observe that they are consistently behind
human capabilities on the tasks in the TREA dataset. While evaluating LALMs, we
also propose an uncertainty metric, which computes the invariance of the model
to semantically identical perturbations of the input. Our analysis shows that
the accuracy and uncertainty metrics are not necessarily correlated and thus,
points to a need for wholesome evaluation of LALMs for high-stakes
applications.

Motivation: 探究LLMs如何跨语言迁移知识，并解决多语言推理中的输出不一致问题。

Method: 使用logit lens分析LLMs解决多语言选择题的隐含步骤，并通过调整潜在处理方向强化共享语义空间。

Result: LLMs依赖单语言子空间导致预测不一致；调整潜在处理方向可提升知识迁移和输出一致性。

Conclusion: 强化共享语义空间利用可改善LLMs的多语言推理能力和输出一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrably capable of cross-lingual
transfer, but can produce inconsistent output when prompted with the same
queries written in different languages. To understand how language models are
able to generalize knowledge from one language to the others, we apply the
logit lens to interpret the implicit steps taken by LLMs to solve multilingual
multi-choice reasoning questions. We find LLMs predict inconsistently and are
less accurate because they rely on subspaces of individual languages, rather
than working in a shared semantic space. While larger models are more
multilingual, we show their hidden states are more likely to dissociate from
the shared representation compared to smaller models, but are nevertheless more
capable of retrieving knowledge embedded across different languages. Finally,
we demonstrate that knowledge sharing can be modulated by steering the models'
latent processing towards the shared semantic space. We find reinforcing
utilization of the shared space improves the models' multilingual reasoning
performance, as a result of more knowledge transfer from, and better output
consistency with English.

Motivation: 研究动机是质疑先前自动欺骗检测研究的可靠性，认为其可能受数据收集人为因素影响，无法推广到特定数据集之外。

Method: 方法包括提出信念欺骗框架，构建多语言DeFaBel语料库，评估常见欺骗线索，并对比不同数据集的欺骗检测效果。

Result: 结果显示欺骗线索与标签相关性极低，模型在DeFaBel上表现接近随机，挑战了欺骗检测的现有假设。

Conclusion: 结论指出欺骗无法仅凭语言线索可靠推断，呼吁重新思考NLP中欺骗研究的方法。

Abstract: Can deception be detected solely from written text? Cues of deceptive
communication are inherently subtle, even more so in text-only communication.
Yet, prior studies have reported considerable success in automatic deception
detection. We hypothesize that such findings are largely driven by artifacts
introduced during data collection and do not generalize beyond specific
datasets. We revisit this assumption by introducing a belief-based deception
framework, which defines deception as a misalignment between an author's claims
and true beliefs, irrespective of factual accuracy, allowing deception cues to
be studied in isolation. Based on this framework, we construct three corpora,
collectively referred to as DeFaBel, including a German-language corpus of
deceptive and non-deceptive arguments and a multilingual version in German and
English, each collected under varying conditions to account for belief change
and enable cross-linguistic analysis. Using these corpora, we evaluate commonly
reported linguistic cues of deception. Across all three DeFaBel variants, these
cues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception
labels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We
further benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar
data collection protocols. While some show statistically significant
correlations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive
cues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection
using feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned
large language models. While some models perform well on established deception
datasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings
challenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from
linguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in
NLP.

Motivation: 中医的全球认可度提升，但其应用需要深厚的临床经验。现有技术如机器学习和深度学习在数据及目标单一性上存在局限，大语言模型虽潜力大但缺乏中医专业性。

Method: 开发了7.6亿参数的Tianyi模型，通过预训练和微调多样中医语料（经典文本、临床记录等），采用渐进学习方式整合知识，并建立TCMEval评估基准。

Result: Tianyi在中医考试、临床任务、领域问答及实际试验中表现优异，展示了作为中医AI助手的潜力。

Conclusion: Tianyi填补了中医知识与实际应用间的鸿沟，为中医临床和研究提供了有效的AI支持。

Abstract: Natural medicines, particularly Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), are
gaining global recognition for their therapeutic potential in addressing human
symptoms and diseases. TCM, with its systematic theories and extensive
practical experience, provides abundant resources for healthcare. However, the
effective application of TCM requires precise syndrome diagnosis, determination
of treatment principles, and prescription formulation, which demand decades of
clinical expertise. Despite advancements in TCM-based decision systems, machine
learning, and deep learning research, limitations in data and single-objective
constraints hinder their practical application. In recent years, large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in complex tasks, but lack
specialization in TCM and face significant challenges, such as too big model
scale to deploy and issues with hallucination. To address these challenges, we
introduce Tianyi with 7.6-billion-parameter LLM, a model scale proper and
specifically designed for TCM, pre-trained and fine-tuned on diverse TCM
corpora, including classical texts, expert treatises, clinical records, and
knowledge graphs. Tianyi is designed to assimilate interconnected and
systematic TCM knowledge through a progressive learning manner. Additionally,
we establish TCMEval, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, to assess LLMs in
TCM examinations, clinical tasks, domain-specific question-answering, and
real-world trials. The extensive evaluations demonstrate the significant
potential of Tianyi as an AI assistant in TCM clinical practice and research,
bridging the gap between TCM knowledge and practical application.

Conclusion: 位置偏移是评估记忆风险的关键因素，之前的研究忽略了这一点。

Abstract: Large language models are known to memorize parts of their training data,
posing risk of copyright violations. To systematically examine this risk, we
pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing
web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at
controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We
thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key
findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short
prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization
decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp
decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of
the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely
disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval
anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that
when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces
degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive
data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization
and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and
previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work
implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training
sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on
natural language understanding in three classical languages -- Sanskrit,
Ancient Greek and Latin -- to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual
zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and
machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than
fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle,
especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on
Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question-answering (QA) dataset and show that
incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly
boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for
smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an
important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models
used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical
languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these
languages and their consequent utility in classical studies.

Result: 实验表明个性化工具使用显著提升用户体验，但当前LLMs在联合推理用户画像和环境因素时能力有限。

Conclusion: 强调了上下文感知个性化的重要性，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: While integrating external tools into large language models (LLMs) enhances
their ability to access real-time information and domain-specific services,
existing approaches focus narrowly on functional tool selection following user
instructions, overlooking the context-aware personalization in tool selection.
This oversight leads to suboptimal user satisfaction and inefficient tool
utilization, particularly when overlapping toolsets require nuanced selection
based on contextual factors. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolSpectrum, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in personalized tool
utilization. Specifically, we formalize two key dimensions of personalization,
user profile and environmental factors, and analyze their individual and
synergistic impacts on tool utilization. Through extensive experiments on
ToolSpectrum, we demonstrate that personalized tool utilization significantly
improves user experience across diverse scenarios. However, even
state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit the limited ability to reason jointly about user
profiles and environmental factors, often prioritizing one dimension at the
expense of the other. Our findings underscore the necessity of context-aware
personalization in tool-augmented LLMs and reveal critical limitations for
current models. Our data and code are available at

Conclusion: SLED通过简化建模流程和避免离散化误差，为语音语言模型提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SLED, an alternative approach to speech language modeling by
encoding speech waveforms into sequences of continuous latent representations
and modeling them autoregressively using an energy distance objective. The
energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by
contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to
capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing
reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and
eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in
existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline
while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference
efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance
in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for
broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.

Abstract: Recent works have revealed the great potential of speculative decoding in
accelerating the autoregressive generation process of large language models.
The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates
and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve
draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa,
involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a
training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose
alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the
prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit
from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple
yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability
threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving
inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering,
summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the
average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method
achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.

Method: 提取句子级音频特征（含多方言音频）和视觉特征，通过多模态对比表示学习与LLM增强的文本特征融合。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上性能优于现有方法，准确率提升至少2.51%，宏F1提升1.63%。

Conclusion: 框架有效提升古典诗歌情感分析性能，开源代码促进多模态中文表示研究。

Abstract: Classical Chinese poetry is a vital and enduring part of Chinese literature,
conveying profound emotional resonance. Existing studies analyze sentiment
based on textual meanings, overlooking the unique rhythmic and visual features
inherent in poetry,especially since it is often recited and accompanied by
Chinese paintings. In this work, we propose a dialect-enhanced multimodal
framework for classical Chinese poetry sentiment analysis. We extract
sentence-level audio features from the poetry and incorporate audio from
multiple dialects,which may retain regional ancient Chinese phonetic features,
enriching the phonetic representation. Additionally, we generate sentence-level
visual features, and the multimodal features are fused with textual features
enhanced by LLM translation through multimodal contrastive representation
learning. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two public
datasets, achieving at least 2.51% improvement in accuracy and 1.63% in macro
F1. We open-source the code to facilitate research in this area and provide
insights for general multimodal Chinese representation.

TL;DR: SeedBench是首个针对种子科学的多任务基准测试，旨在评估26种领先的大型语言模型（LLMs）在种子育种中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 种子科学对现代农业至关重要，但面临跨学科复杂性、高成本和数字资源稀缺等挑战，限制了LLMs的应用。

Method: SeedBench由领域专家开发，模拟现代育种过程的关键环节，并评估了26种LLMs的性能。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在解决实际种子科学问题方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: SeedBench为LLMs在种子设计领域的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Seed science is essential for modern agriculture, directly influencing crop
yields and global food security. However, challenges such as interdisciplinary
complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a
shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their
application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital
resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized
benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench -- the first multi-task
benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration
with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key
aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific
fine-tuned models. Our findings not only highlight the substantial gaps between
the power of LLMs and the real-world seed science problems, but also make a
foundational step for research on LLMs for seed design.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of global digitalization, users from different
countries increasingly rely on social media for information exchange. In this
context, multilingual multi-label emotion detection has emerged as a critical
research area. This study addresses SemEval-2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection. Our paper focuses on two sub-tracks of this task:
(1) Track A: Multi-label emotion detection, and (2) Track B: Emotion intensity.
To tackle multilingual challenges, we leverage pre-trained multilingual models
and focus on two architectures: (1) a fine-tuned BERT-based classification
model and (2) an instruction-tuned generative LLM. Additionally, we propose two
methods for handling multi-label classification: the base method, which maps an
input directly to all its corresponding emotion labels, and the pairwise
method, which models the relationship between the input text and each emotion
category individually. Experimental results demonstrate the strong
generalization ability of our approach in multilingual emotion recognition. In
Track A, our method achieved Top 4 performance across 10 languages, ranking 1st
in Hindi. In Track B, our approach also secured Top 5 performance in 7
languages, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness\footnote{Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨互联网对边缘化社区的双重影响，提出需从社会方法而非仅计算方案解决网络仇恨言论问题。

Method: 建议语言学与NLP研究者结合社会知识，与社区、政策制定者合作，推动数字包容。

Result: 强调语言学研究的潜力，可通过社会合作缓解数字空间中的反社会行为风险。

Conclusion: 语言学与NLP研究应与社会力量合作，促进数字公平并缩小数字鸿沟。

Abstract: The advent of the internet has been both a blessing and a curse for once
marginalised communities. When used well, the internet can be used to connect
and establish communities crossing different intersections; however, it can
also be used as a tool to alienate people and communities as well as perpetuate
hate, misinformation, and disinformation especially on social media platforms.
We propose steering hate speech research and researchers away from pre-existing
computational solutions and consider social methods to inform social solutions
to address this social problem. In a similar way linguistics research can
inform language planning policy, linguists should apply what we know about
language and society to mitigate some of the emergent risks and dangers of
anti-social behaviour in digital spaces. We argue linguists and NLP researchers
can play a principle role in unleashing the social impact potential of
linguistics research working alongside communities, advocates, activists, and
policymakers to enable equitable digital inclusion and to close the digital
divide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生活中的文本规划任务（如会议安排）对LLMs提出了挑战，尤其是在高复杂度情况下。研究旨在系统评估闭源和开源模型在生成程序代码方面的表现。

Method: 研究比较了闭源和开源模型，包括那些在推理时能根据复杂度扩展输出长度的模型，生成了Python代码和约束满足问题求解器代码。

Result: 尽管任务具有算法性质，编程通常优于规划，但生成的代码在鲁棒性和效率方面存在问题，影响了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明编程在复杂文本规划任务中表现更好，但生成的代码需要改进鲁棒性和效率以提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much
challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work
primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source
models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models,
including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in
generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not
only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction
problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that
programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error
analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated
code that hinders generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HeteroSpec是一种自适应异构性的推测解码框架，通过动态优化计算资源分配，显著提升大型语言模型推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是LLM推理的瓶颈，现有推测解码算法未能充分利用语言复杂性异质性，导致资源分配不优。

Method: 提出HeteroSpec框架，包括基于累积元路径Top-K熵的预测机制和动态资源分配策略。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个模型上，平均加速4.26倍，优于现有技术EAGLE-3。

Conclusion: HeteroSpec无需重新训练，开销低，兼容其他加速技术，为上下文感知的LLM推理加速提供了新范式。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding, the standard approach for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference, remains a significant bottleneck due to its sequential nature. While
speculative decoding algorithms mitigate this inefficiency through parallel
verification, they fail to exploit the inherent heterogeneity in linguistic
complexity, a key factor leading to suboptimal resource allocation. We address
this by proposing HeteroSpec, a heterogeneity-adaptive speculative decoding
framework that dynamically optimizes computational resource allocation based on
linguistic context complexity. HeteroSpec introduces two key mechanisms: (1) A
novel cumulative meta-path Top-$K$ entropy metric for efficiently identifying
predictable contexts. (2) A dynamic resource allocation strategy based on
data-driven entropy partitioning, enabling adaptive speculative expansion and
pruning tailored to local context difficulty. Evaluated on five public
benchmarks and four models, HeteroSpec achieves an average speedup of
4.26$\times$. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art EAGLE-3 across
speedup rates, average acceptance length, and verification cost. Notably,
HeteroSpec requires no draft model retraining, incurs minimal overhead, and is
orthogonal to other acceleration techniques. It demonstrates enhanced
acceleration with stronger draft models, establishing a new paradigm for
context-aware LLM inference acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法通常优化模型以平均偏好为目标，忽略了人类偏好的多样性和矛盾性，缺乏针对个体细粒度偏好的数据集。

Method: 提出WikiPersona数据集，通过生成可验证的文本描述来对齐名人背景和偏好，并评估不同个性化方法。

Result: 研究发现，使用推断的个人偏好作为前缀能有效个性化模型，尤其在偏好冲突的主题中，且能更公平地泛化到未见过的个体。

Conclusion: WikiPersona数据集为个性化偏好对齐提供了新方向，推断偏好前缀方法在效果和效率上表现优越。

Abstract: Preference alignment has become a standard pipeline in finetuning models to
follow \emph{generic} human preferences. Majority of work seeks to optimize
model to produce responses that would be preferable \emph{on average},
simplifying the diverse and often \emph{contradicting} space of human
preferences. While research has increasingly focused on personalized alignment:
adapting models to individual user preferences, there is a lack of personalized
preference dataset which focus on nuanced individual-level preferences. To
address this, we introduce WikiPersona: the first fine-grained personalization
using well-documented, famous individuals. Our dataset challenges models to
align with these personas through an interpretable process: generating
verifiable textual descriptions of a persona's background and preferences in
addition to alignment. We systematically evaluate different personalization
approaches and find that as few-shot prompting with preferences and fine-tuning
fail to simultaneously ensure effectiveness and efficiency, using
\textit{inferred personal preferences} as prefixes enables effective
personalization, especially in topics where preferences clash while leading to
more equitable generalization across unseen personas.

Motivation: 解决RAG中生成器利用检索信息的效率和透明性问题。

Result: 在多跳QA数据集上性能提升10-30%，媲美商业LLMs。

Conclusion: ARENA具有强适应性和可扩展性，模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive domains.
However, although RAG achieved successes across distinct domains, there are
still some unsolved challenges: 1) Effectiveness. Existing research mainly
focuses on developing more powerful RAG retrievers, but how to enhance the
generator's (LLM's) ability to utilize the retrieved information for reasoning
and generation? 2) Transparency. Most RAG methods ignore which retrieved
content actually contributes to the reasoning process, resulting in a lack of
interpretability and visibility. To address this, we propose ARENA
(Adaptive-Rewarded Evidence Navigation Agent), a transparent RAG generator
framework trained via reinforcement learning (RL) with our proposed rewards.
Based on the structured generation and adaptive reward calculation, our
RL-based training enables the model to identify key evidence, perform
structured reasoning, and generate answers with interpretable decision traces.
Applied to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, abundant experiments
with various RAG baselines demonstrate that our model achieves 10-30%
improvements on all multi-hop QA datasets, which is comparable with the SOTA
Commercially-developed LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1). Further analyses
show that ARENA has strong flexibility to be adopted on new datasets without
extra training. Our models and codes are publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音反馈在对话系统中对确保共同理解至关重要，但其韵律相似性的感知及现有语音表征的反映尚不明确。

Method: 采用三元比较任务，从两个数据集中选取语音反馈，测量参与者感知的相似性，并分析不同语音表征的效果。

Result: 频谱和自监督语音表征在反映韵律相似性上优于基频特征，尤其是同一说话者的反馈；对比学习可进一步优化表征。

Conclusion: 语音反馈的韵律相似性可通过特定表征有效捕捉，对比学习能提升其与人类感知的一致性。

Abstract: Vocal feedback (e.g., `mhm', `yeah', `okay') is an important component of
spoken dialogue and is crucial to ensuring common ground in conversational
systems. The exact meaning of such feedback is conveyed through both lexical
and prosodic form. In this work, we investigate the perceived prosodic
similarity of vocal feedback with the same lexical form, and to what extent
existing speech representations reflect such similarities. A triadic comparison
task with recruited participants is used to measure perceived similarity of
feedback responses taken from two different datasets. We find that spectral and
self-supervised speech representations encode prosody better than extracted
pitch features, especially in the case of feedback from the same speaker. We
also find that it is possible to further condense and align the representations
to human perception through contrastive learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Self-Consistency和Self-Correction在提升SQL生成准确性时存在局限性，前者可能选择次优输出，后者仅修正语法错误。

Method: 提出CSC-SQL方法，选择并行采样中最频繁的两个输出，通过合并修正模型进行修正，并使用GRPO算法进行强化学习微调。

Result: 在BIRD开发集上，3B模型达到65.28%执行准确率，7B模型达到69.19%。

Conclusion: CSC-SQL有效且通用，代码将开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
translating natural language questions about relational databases into SQL
queries. In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency
and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing
computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable
limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority
votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To
leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method
that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two
most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a
merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and
revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output
quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of
CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution
accuracy, while the 7B model achieves 69.19%. The code will be open sourced at

Motivation: 随着数据增长，分类法扩展变得重要，但现有方法存在表示限制、泛化能力差或噪声问题。

Method: LORex通过排序和分块候选词，结合层次推理过滤噪声并迭代优化选择。

Result: 在四个基准测试和十二个基线方法中，LORex的准确率提高了12%，Wu & Palmer相似度提高了5%。

Conclusion: LORex在分类法扩展任务中表现优于现有方法，具有更高的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Taxonomies are hierarchical knowledge graphs crucial for recommendation
systems, and web applications. As data grows, expanding taxonomies is
essential, but existing methods face key challenges: (1) discriminative models
struggle with representation limits and generalization, while (2) generative
methods either process all candidates at once, introducing noise and exceeding
context limits, or discard relevant entities by selecting noisy candidates. We
propose LORex ($\textbf{L}$ineage-$\textbf{O}$riented $\textbf{Re}$asoning for
Taxonomy E$\textbf{x}$pansion), a plug-and-play framework that combines
discriminative ranking and generative reasoning for efficient taxonomy
expansion. Unlike prior methods, LORex ranks and chunks candidate terms into
batches, filtering noise and iteratively refining selections by reasoning
candidates' hierarchy to ensure contextual efficiency. Extensive experiments
across four benchmarks and twelve baselines show that LORex improves accuracy
by 12% and Wu & Palmer similarity by 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在新闻推荐系统中的广泛应用，其传播虚假信息的潜在风险引发关注。研究旨在探索图像对VLMs转发行为的影响，以及模型和用户特质的调节作用。

Method: 采用一种基于‘越狱’提示的策略，模拟具有反社会特质和政治倾向的用户行为，并构建了一个多模态数据集（含事实核查的政治新闻及图像）。

Result: 实验显示，图像使真实新闻转发率增加4.8%，虚假新闻增加15%。用户特质（如黑暗三人格）和政治倾向会进一步影响转发行为，仅Claude-3-Haiku对虚假信息表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态模型在传播虚假信息中的风险，呼吁开发针对性的评估框架和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly integrated into news recommendation
systems, raising concerns about their role in spreading misinformation. In
humans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of
information, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.
We present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to
reshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how
persona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support
this analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a
jailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from
VLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;
and a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired
with corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across
model families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for
true news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this
effect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas
Republican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the
tested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual
misinformation. These findings highlight emerging risks in multimodal model
behavior and motivate the development of tailored evaluation frameworks and
mitigation strategies for personalized AI systems. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reasoning Boundary Framework++ (RBF++)，用于解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)推理在现实应用中的两大挑战：定量评估和优化可测量边界，以及处理不可测量边界（如多模态感知）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT推理缺乏定量指标和可操作指南，且无法评估不可测量能力（如多模态感知），限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出RBF++框架，定义推理边界（RB）作为性能上限，并提出组合定律和常数假设来处理可测量和不可测量边界。此外，引入推理边界划分机制。

Result: 在13个任务中验证了框架的可行性，评估了10种CoT策略，并扩展了评估基准。

Conclusion: RBF++框架为理解和优化LLM推理边界提供了新视角，推动了CoT推理的实际应用。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has proven effective in enhancing large
language models (LLMs) on complex tasks, spurring research into its underlying
mechanisms. However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:
(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating
and optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of
methods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal
perception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary
Framework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning
boundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a
combination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable
guidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in
multimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces
unmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the
reasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two
sub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both
unmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities. Extensive
experiments involving 38 models across 13 tasks validate the feasibility of our
framework in cross-modal settings. Additionally, we evaluate 10 CoT strategies,
offer insights into optimization and decay from two complementary perspectives,
and expand evaluation benchmarks for measuring RBs in LLM reasoning. We hope
this work advances the understanding of RBs and optimization strategies in
LLMs. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GUARD的框架，通过动态调整生成过程实现LLMs的选择性遗忘，避免微调带来的性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在记忆大量知识方面表现出色，但选择性遗忘对模型安全和合规至关重要。现有方法通过微调模糊了遗忘与保留知识的边界，影响整体性能。

Method: GUARD框架在推理时动态遗忘：1) 使用提示分类器检测遗忘目标并提取禁止令牌；2) 结合令牌匹配和语义匹配动态惩罚和过滤候选令牌。

Result: 在多个任务（如版权内容遗忘和实体遗忘）中，GUARD表现出色，几乎不影响LLM的通用能力。

Conclusion: GUARD在遗忘与模型性能之间取得了良好平衡，为LLMs的安全部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
memorizing vast amounts of knowledge across diverse domains. However, the
ability to selectively forget specific knowledge is critical for ensuring the
safety and compliance of deployed models. Existing unlearning efforts typically
fine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a
calibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary
between forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of
overall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be
better to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against
generating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the
fluency of text generation. In this work, we propose Generation-time Unlearning
via Adaptive Restriction and Detection (GUARD), a framework that enables
dynamic unlearning during LLM generation. Specifically, we first employ a
prompt classifier to detect unlearning targets and extract the corresponding
forbidden token. We then dynamically penalize and filter candidate tokens
during generation using a combination of token matching and semantic matching,
effectively preventing the model from leaking the forgotten content.
Experimental results on copyright content unlearning tasks over the Harry
Potter dataset and the MUSE benchmark, as well as entity unlearning tasks on
the TOFU dataset, demonstrate that GUARD achieves strong forget quality across
various tasks while causing almost no degradation to the LLM's general
capabilities, striking an excellent trade-off between forgetting and utility.

(LAs) for tool use primarily focus on stateless, single-turn interactions or
partial evaluations, such as tool selection in a single turn, overlooking the
inherent stateful nature of interactions in multi-turn applications. To fulfill
this gap, we propose \texttt{DialogTool}, a multi-turn dialogue dataset with
stateful tool interactions considering the whole life cycle of tool use, across
six key tasks in three stages: 1) \textit{tool creation}; 2) \textit{tool
utilization}: tool awareness, tool selection, tool execution; and 3)
\textit{role-consistent response}: response generation and role play.
Furthermore, we build \texttt{VirtualMobile} -- an embodied virtual mobile
evaluation environment to simulate API calls and assess the robustness of the
created APIs\footnote{We will use tools and APIs alternatively, there are no
significant differences between them in this paper.}. Taking advantage of these
artifacts, we conduct comprehensive evaluation on 13 distinct open- and
closed-source LLMs and provide detailed analysis at each stage, revealing that
the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well to use tools over
long horizons.

*Qiongqiong Wang,Hardik B. Sailor,Tianchi Liu,Ai Ti Aw*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从真实语音数据生成数据集的新框架，结合上下文推理和副语言信息，用于提升语音-LLM的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音-LLM在上下文推理和副语言理解方面能力有限，缺乏涵盖这两方面的QA数据集。

Method: 提出了一种框架，包括基于伪副语言标签的数据浓缩和基于LLM的上下文副语言QA生成。

Result: 验证了框架的有效性，发现语音-LLM在处理共情推理任务时存在局限性。

Conclusion: 该框架是首创，有望训练更具鲁棒性的语音-LLM。

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning
alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of
Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel
framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates
contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo
paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and
LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is
validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset.
The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic
reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust
models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in
training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，传统人工评估效率低下，自动评估成为趋势，但现有评估模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出EIS-GRPO算法训练评估模型J4R，并引入ReasoningJudgeBench基准。

Result: J4R在JudgeBench和ReasoningJudgeBench上表现优于GPT-4o和其他小型评估模型，性能提升6.7%和9%。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习训练的J4R有效提升了复杂推理任务的评估能力，为自动评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: To keep pace with the increasing pace of large language models (LLM)
development, model output evaluation has transitioned away from time-consuming
human evaluation to automatic evaluation, where LLMs themselves are tasked with
assessing and critiquing other model outputs. LLM-as-judge models are a class
of generative evaluators that excel in evaluating relatively simple domains,
like chat quality, but struggle in reasoning intensive domains where model
responses contain more substantive and challenging content. To remedy existing
judge shortcomings, we explore training judges with reinforcement learning
(RL). We make three key contributions: (1) We propose the Equivalent Initial
State Group Relative Policy Optimization (EIS-GRPO) algorithm, which allows us
to train our judge to be robust to positional biases that arise in more complex
evaluation settings. (2) We introduce ReasoningJudgeBench, a benchmark that
evaluates judges in diverse reasoning settings not covered by prior work. (3)
We train Judge for Reasoning (J4R), a 7B judge trained with EIS-GRPO that
outperforms GPT-4o and the next best small judge by 6.7% and 9%, matching or
exceeding the performance of larger GRPO-trained judges on both JudgeBench and
ReasoningJudgeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM作为评估者的可靠性和安全性，尤其是对抗性攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 使用GCG优化方法设计对抗性后缀，测试两种攻击策略（CUA和JMA）在开源LLM上的效果。

Result: CUA攻击成功率超过30%，JMA也显著有效，表明当前LLM评估系统存在严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前LLM评估系统易受攻击，需加强防御机制并进一步研究对抗性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as evaluators
(LLM-as-a-Judge) for assessing the quality of machine-generated text. This
paradigm offers scalability and cost-effectiveness compared to human
annotation. However, the reliability and security of such systems, particularly
their robustness against adversarial manipulations, remain critical concerns.
This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge architectures to
prompt-injection attacks, where malicious inputs are designed to compromise the
judge's decision-making process. We formalize two primary attack strategies:
Comparative Undermining Attack (CUA), which directly targets the final decision
output, and Justification Manipulation Attack (JMA), which aims to alter the
model's generated reasoning. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG)
optimization method, we craft adversarial suffixes appended to one of the
responses being compared. Experiments conducted on the MT-Bench Human Judgments
dataset with open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and
Falcon3-3B-Instruct) demonstrate significant susceptibility. The CUA achieves
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 30\%, while JMA also shows notable
effectiveness. These findings highlight substantial vulnerabilities in current
LLM-as-a-Judge systems, underscoring the need for robust defense mechanisms and
further research into adversarial evaluation and trustworthiness in LLM-based
assessment frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在长代码上下文中的推理能力，区分了词汇代码回忆（逐字检索）和语义代码回忆（理解代码功能），并提出了SemTrace技术来测量语义回忆。研究发现，随着代码片段接近输入上下文的中间位置，LLM的代码推理准确性显著下降，且词汇回忆和语义回忆之间存在脱节。

Motivation: 探讨LLM在长代码上下文中的推理能力及其与回忆能力的关系，以揭示现有基准测试可能低估了LLM在利用上下文信息时的挑战。

Method: 提出SemTrace技术测量语义回忆，并量化现有基准测试中的语义回忆敏感性。评估了最先进的LLM在不同代码回忆任务中的表现。

Result: LLM的代码推理准确性在代码片段接近上下文中间时显著下降，词汇回忆和语义回忆表现不同，且现有基准测试可能低估了语义回忆的挑战。

Conclusion: 当前代码推理基准测试可能对LLM的语义回忆敏感性不足，需改进以更准确评估LLM在长上下文中的表现。

Abstract: Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large
contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning
remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code
snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability.
Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval)
and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic
recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of
specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also
present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing
benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop
in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input
context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like
SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with
models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall.
Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting
different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current
code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity,
potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context
information.

Motivation: 开发者通过自然语言与LLM沟通时，提示常不完整，导致用户重要需求未被充分捕捉。

Method: 分析了提示不完整的影响，并提出了需求感知的提示优化机制。

Result: LLM默认能猜测41.1%未指定需求，但不稳定；优化机制平均提升性能4.8%。

Conclusion: 有效管理提示不完整需包括需求发现、评估和监控的完整流程。

Abstract: Building LLM-powered software requires developers to communicate their
requirements through natural language, but developer prompts are frequently
underspecified, failing to fully capture many user-important requirements. In
this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of prompt underspecification,
showing that while LLMs can often (41.1%) guess unspecified requirements by
default, such behavior is less robust: Underspecified prompts are 2x more
likely to regress over model or prompt changes, sometimes with accuracy drops
by more than 20%. We then demonstrate that simply adding more requirements to a
prompt does not reliably improve performance, due to LLMs' limited
instruction-following capabilities and competing constraints, and standard
prompt optimizers do not offer much help. To address this, we introduce novel
requirements-aware prompt optimization mechanisms that can improve performance
by 4.8% on average over baselines that naively specify everything in the
prompt. Beyond prompt optimization, we envision that effectively managing
prompt underspecification requires a broader process, including proactive
requirements discovery, evaluation, and monitoring.

TL;DR: Thinkless框架通过自适应选择短链或长链推理，显著提升推理语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在所有查询中均使用复杂推理导致的计算效率低下问题。

Method: 提出Thinkless框架，使用强化学习训练，结合DeGRPO算法，通过控制令牌选择推理模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Thinkless减少长链推理使用50%-90%，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: Thinkless为LLMs提供了一种高效的自适应推理方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models, capable of extended chain-of-thought reasoning,
have demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks requiring complex logical
inference. However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results
in substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems
admit straightforward solutions. This motivates an open question: Can LLMs
learn when to think? To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable
framework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and
long-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.
Thinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two
control tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed
reasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy
Optimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of
hybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the
selection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the
accuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables
fine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing
training and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.
Empirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and
GSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -
90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models. The

Motivation: 现有奖励模型缺乏可控性和可解释性，且优化目标狭窄，限制了其通用性。

Method: 提出R3框架，具有维度无关性、通用性和可解释性，支持基于推理的评分。

Result: R3实现了更透明和灵活的语言模型评估，支持多样化的价值观和应用场景。

Conclusion: R3为奖励建模提供了更通用和可解释的解决方案，开源模型和数据促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning language model outputs with human
preferences, yet existing approaches often lack both controllability and
interpretability. These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives,
limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their
scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To
address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework
that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and
provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent
and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with
diverse human values and use cases. Our models, data, and code are available as

Abstract: The paradigm of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) as evaluative judges has emerged as an effective
approach in RLHF and inference-time scaling. In this work, we propose
Multimodal Reasoner as a Judge (MR. Judge), a paradigm for empowering
general-purpose MLLMs judges with strong reasoning capabilities. Instead of
directly assigning scores for each response, we formulate the judgement process
as a reasoning-inspired multiple-choice problem. Specifically, the judge model
first conducts deliberate reasoning covering different aspects of the responses
and eventually selects the best response from them. This reasoning process not
only improves the interpretibility of the judgement, but also greatly enhances
the performance of MLLM judges. To cope with the lack of questions with scored
responses, we propose the following strategy to achieve automatic annotation:
1) Reverse Response Candidates Synthesis: starting from a supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset, we treat the original response as the best candidate
and prompt the MLLM to generate plausible but flawed negative candidates. 2)
Text-based reasoning extraction: we carefully design a data synthesis pipeline
for distilling the reasoning capability from a text-based reasoning model,
which is adopted to enable the MLLM judges to regain complex reasoning ability
via warm up supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that our MR. Judge
is effective across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, our MR. Judge-7B
surpasses GPT-4o by 9.9% on VL-RewardBench, and improves performance on MM-Vet
during inference-time scaling by up to 7.7%.

Abstract: Recently, large reasoning models have achieved impressive performance on
various tasks by employing human-like deep thinking. However, the lengthy
thinking process substantially increases inference overhead, making efficiency
a critical bottleneck. In this work, we first demonstrate that NoThinking,
which prompts the reasoning model to skip thinking and directly generate the
final solution, is a better choice for relatively simple tasks in terms of both
performance and efficiency. Motivated by this, we propose AdaptThink, a novel
RL algorithm to teach reasoning models to choose the optimal thinking mode
adaptively based on problem difficulty. Specifically, AdaptThink features two
core components: (1) a constrained optimization objective that encourages the
model to choose NoThinking while maintaining the overall performance; (2) an
importance sampling strategy that balances Thinking and NoThinking samples
during on-policy training, thereby enabling cold start and allowing the model
to explore and exploit both thinking modes throughout the training process. Our
experiments indicate that AdaptThink significantly reduces the inference costs
while further enhancing performance. Notably, on three math datasets,
AdaptThink reduces the average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B
by 53% and improves its accuracy by 2.4%, highlighting the promise of adaptive
thinking-mode selection for optimizing the balance between reasoning quality
and efficiency. Our codes and models are available at

Conclusion: 研究提供了可解释的框架，帮助非专家更准确地识别痴呆症的语言特征，弥补漏诊问题。

Abstract: Cognitive decline often surfaces in language years before diagnosis. It is
frequently non-experts, such as those closest to the patient, who first sense a
change and raise concern. As LLMs become integrated into daily communication
and used over prolonged periods, it may even be an LLM that notices something
is off. But what exactly do they notice--and should be noticing--when making
that judgment? This paper investigates how dementia is perceived through
language by non-experts. We presented transcribed picture descriptions to
non-expert humans and LLMs, asking them to intuitively judge whether each text
was produced by someone healthy or with dementia. We introduce an explainable
method that uses LLMs to extract high-level, expert-guided features
representing these picture descriptions, and use logistic regression to model
human and LLM perceptions and compare with clinical diagnoses. Our analysis
reveals that human perception of dementia is inconsistent and relies on a
narrow, and sometimes misleading, set of cues. LLMs, by contrast, draw on a
richer, more nuanced feature set that aligns more closely with clinical
patterns. Still, both groups show a tendency toward false negatives, frequently
overlooking dementia cases. Through our interpretable framework and the
insights it provides, we hope to help non-experts better recognize the
linguistic signs that matter.

Conclusion: SMOTExT为数据保护和高效学习提供了一种可行路径。

Abstract: Data scarcity and class imbalance are persistent challenges in training
robust NLP models, especially in specialized domains or low-resource settings.
We propose a novel technique, SMOTExT, that adapts the idea of Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) to textual data. Our method generates new
synthetic examples by interpolating between BERT-based embeddings of two
existing examples and then decoding the resulting latent point into text with
xRAG architecture. By leveraging xRAG's cross-modal retrieval-generation
framework, we can effectively turn interpolated vectors into coherent text.
While this is preliminary work supported by qualitative outputs only, the
method shows strong potential for knowledge distillation and data augmentation
in few-shot settings. Notably, our approach also shows promise for
privacy-preserving machine learning: in early experiments, training models
solely on generated data achieved comparable performance to models trained on
the original dataset. This suggests a viable path toward safe and effective
learning under data protection constraints.

Conclusion: 当前LVLMs在视觉推理方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进以缩小与人类表现的差距。

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a unique challenge for large vision-language
models (LVLMs), as it requires the integration of sophisticated textual and
visual reasoning capabilities. However, current LVLMs exhibit a notable
imbalance between these skills, falling short on visual reasoning that is
difficult to perform in text. We conduct a case study using a synthetic dataset
solvable only through visual reasoning and show that model performance degrades
significantly with increasing visual complexity, while human performance
remains robust. We then introduce ChartMuseum, a new Chart Question Answering
(QA) benchmark containing 1,162 expert-annotated questions spanning multiple
reasoning types, curated from real-world charts across 184 sources,
specifically built to evaluate complex visual and textual reasoning. Unlike
prior chart understanding benchmarks -- where frontier models perform similarly
and near saturation -- our benchmark exposes a substantial gap between model
and human performance, while effectively differentiating model capabilities:
although humans achieve 93% accuracy, the best-performing model Gemini-2.5-Pro
attains only 63.0%, and the leading open-source LVLM Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
achieves only 38.5%. Moreover, on questions requiring primarily visual
reasoning, all models experience a 35%-55% performance drop from
text-reasoning-heavy question performance. Lastly, our qualitative error
analysis reveals specific categories of visual reasoning that are challenging
for current LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法通过自然语言提示或离散信号控制语言模型生成，但这些方法脆弱且难以扩展。

Result: 该方法在控制响应长度上比上下文学习或离散信号方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 连续信号控制为语言模型提供了更灵活和可扩展的用户意图对齐方式。

Abstract: Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant
to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow
users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example,
controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that
gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate
users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or
discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this
work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist
along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or
via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in
controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we
demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be
controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a
"low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts
response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods
that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.

Abstract: Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical
applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have
driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or
properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked
interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both
correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this
paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the
segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel
regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that
maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned
on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages
the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the
network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.
Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting
unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world
adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战性能提升必然优化内部表征的观点，揭示不同训练方法对网络内部结构的影响。

Method: 比较进化网络和SGD训练网络在生成单张图像任务中的表现，可视化隐藏神经元功能。

Result: SGD训练网络表现出断裂纠缠表征（FER），而进化网络接近统一分解表征（UFR）。

Conclusion: FER可能损害模型能力，理解和缓解FER对表征学习至关重要。

Abstract: Much of the excitement in modern AI is driven by the observation that scaling
up existing systems leads to better performance. But does better performance
necessarily imply better internal representations? While the representational
optimist assumes it must, this position paper challenges that view. We compare
neural networks evolved through an open-ended search process to networks
trained via conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simple task
of generating a single image. This minimal setup offers a unique advantage:
each hidden neuron's full functional behavior can be easily visualized as an
image, thus revealing how the network's output behavior is internally
constructed neuron by neuron. The result is striking: while both networks
produce the same output behavior, their internal representations differ
dramatically. The SGD-trained networks exhibit a form of disorganization that
we term fractured entangled representation (FER). Interestingly, the evolved
networks largely lack FER, even approaching a unified factored representation
(UFR). In large models, FER may be degrading core model capacities like
generalization, creativity, and (continual) learning. Therefore, understanding
and mitigating FER could be critical to the future of representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面纹理定位是一种低成本、高精度的解决方案，适用于动态环境且无需环境修改。现有BoW系统需要进一步优化以提高性能。

Method: 采用近似k均值（AKM）词汇表和软分配，结合地面纹理定位的固定方向和尺度约束，提出高精度和高速两种算法版本。

Result: 通过消融实验验证了改进效果，在全局定位和闭环检测中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法可直接替代现有BoW系统，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Ground texture localization using a downward-facing camera offers a low-cost,
high-precision localization solution that is robust to dynamic environments and
requires no environmental modification. We present a significantly improved
bag-of-words (BoW) image retrieval system for ground texture localization,
achieving substantially higher accuracy for global localization and higher
precision and recall for loop closure detection in SLAM. Our approach leverages
an approximate $k$-means (AKM) vocabulary with soft assignment, and exploits
the consistent orientation and constant scale constraints inherent to ground
texture localization. Identifying the different needs of global localization
vs. loop closure detection for SLAM, we present both high-accuracy and
high-speed versions of our algorithm. We test the effect of each of our
proposed improvements through an ablation study and demonstrate our method's
effectiveness for both global localization and loop closure detection. With
numerous ground texture localization systems already using BoW, our method can
readily replace other generic BoW systems in their pipeline and immediately
improve their results.

Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示（INRs）激活函数存在频谱偏差、对噪声敏感、难以同时捕捉局部和全局特征等问题，且需要手动调参。

Method: 提出BandRC激活函数，结合信号中的深度先验知识，通过任务特定模型调整激活函数。

Result: 在图像重建、去噪、超分辨率、修复和3D形状重建等任务中，BandRC显著优于现有激活函数，PSNR提升明显。

Conclusion: BandRC是一种高效且适应性强的激活函数，能够显著提升INRs在多种计算机视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: In recent years, implicit neural representations(INRs) have gained popularity
in the computer vision community. This is mainly due to the strong performance
of INRs in many computer vision tasks. These networks can extract a continuous
signal representation given a discrete signal representation. In previous
studies, it has been repeatedly shown that INR performance has a strong
correlation with the activation functions used in its multilayer perceptrons.
Although numerous activation functions have been proposed that are competitive
with one another, they share some common set of challenges such as spectral
bias(Lack of sensitivity to high-frequency content in signals), limited
robustness to signal noise and difficulties in simultaneous capturing both
local and global features. and furthermore, the requirement for manual
parameter tuning. To address these issues, we introduce a novel activation
function, Band Shifted Raised Cosine Activated Implicit Neural Networks
\textbf{(BandRC)} tailored to enhance signal representation capacity further.
We also incorporate deep prior knowledge extracted from the signal to adjust
the activation functions through a task-specific model. Through a mathematical
analysis and a series of experiments which include image reconstruction (with a
+8.93 dB PSNR improvement over the nearest counterpart), denoising (with a
+0.46 dB increase in PSNR), super-resolution (with a +1.03 dB improvement over
the nearest State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) method for 6X super-resolution),
inpainting, and 3D shape reconstruction we demonstrate the dominance of BandRC
over existing state of the art activation functions.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DPSeg通过双提示策略有效解决了图像与文本嵌入的领域差距问题，并提升了分割精度。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct
semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level.
Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models
like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text
embeddings, even after extensive alignment during training. Additionally,
relying solely on deep text-aligned features limits shallow-level feature
guidance, which is crucial for detecting small objects and fine details,
ultimately reducing segmentation accuracy. To address these limitations, we
propose a dual prompting framework, DPSeg, for this task. Our approach combines
dual-prompt cost volume generation, a cost volume-guided decoder, and a
semantic-guided prompt refinement strategy that leverages our dual prompting
scheme to mitigate alignment issues in visual prompt generation. By
incorporating visual embeddings from a visual prompt encoder, our approach
reduces the domain gap between text and image embeddings while providing
multi-level guidance through shallow features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches on multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: LoFT能够生成高保真和多样性的合成数据，有效提升监督学习性能。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, using synthetically
generated data seldom brings a significant boost in performance for supervised
learning. Oftentimes, synthetic datasets do not faithfully recreate the data
distribution of real data, i.e., they lack the fidelity or diversity needed for
effective downstream model training. While previous work has employed few-shot
guidance to address this issue, existing methods still fail to capture and
generate features unique to specific real images. In this paper, we introduce a
novel dataset generation framework named LoFT, LoRA-Fused Training-data
Generation with Few-shot Guidance. Our method fine-tunes LoRA weights on
individual real images and fuses them at inference time, producing synthetic
images that combine the features of real images for improved diversity and
fidelity of generated data. We evaluate the synthetic data produced by LoFT on
10 datasets, using 8 to 64 real images per class as guidance and scaling up to
1000 images per class. Our experiments show that training on LoFT-generated
data consistently outperforms other synthetic dataset methods, significantly
increasing accuracy as the dataset size increases. Additionally, our analysis
demonstrates that LoFT generates datasets with high fidelity and sufficient
diversity, which contribute to the performance improvement. The code is

Motivation: 现有令牌缩减技术忽视了扩散模型的去噪先验，导致加速效果和图像质量下降。

Method: 提出SDTM方法，动态压缩特征冗余，包括动态视觉令牌合并、压缩比调整和提示重加权。

Result: 实验表明，SDTM实现了1.55倍的加速，且对图像质量影响可忽略。

Conclusion: SDTM是一种高效的后训练方法，可无缝集成到任何DiT架构中。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have shown exceptional performance in visual
generation but incur high computational costs. Token reduction techniques that
compress models by sharing the denoising process among similar tokens have been
introduced. However, existing approaches neglect the denoising priors of the
diffusion models, leading to suboptimal acceleration and diminished image
quality. This study proposes a novel concept: attend to prune feature
redundancies in areas not attended by the diffusion process. We analyze the
location and degree of feature redundancies based on the structure-then-detail
denoising priors. Subsequently, we introduce SDTM, a structure-then-detail
token merging approach that dynamically compresses feature redundancies.
Specifically, we design dynamic visual token merging, compression ratio
adjusting, and prompt reweighting for different stages. Served in a
post-training way, the proposed method can be integrated seamlessly into any
DiT architecture. Extensive experiments across various backbones, schedulers,
and datasets showcase the superiority of our method, for example, it achieves
1.55 times acceleration with negligible impact on image quality. Project page:

Conclusion: 发布EgoDex数据集旨在推动机器人、计算机视觉和基础模型的发展。

Abstract: Imitation learning for manipulation has a well-known data scarcity problem.
Unlike natural language and 2D computer vision, there is no Internet-scale
corpus of data for dexterous manipulation. One appealing option is egocentric
human video, a passively scalable data source. However, existing large-scale
datasets such as Ego4D do not have native hand pose annotations and do not
focus on object manipulation. To this end, we use Apple Vision Pro to collect
EgoDex: the largest and most diverse dataset of dexterous human manipulation to
date. EgoDex has 829 hours of egocentric video with paired 3D hand and finger
tracking data collected at the time of recording, where multiple calibrated
cameras and on-device SLAM can be used to precisely track the pose of every
joint of each hand. The dataset covers a wide range of diverse manipulation
behaviors with everyday household objects in 194 different tabletop tasks
ranging from tying shoelaces to folding laundry. Furthermore, we train and
systematically evaluate imitation learning policies for hand trajectory
prediction on the dataset, introducing metrics and benchmarks for measuring
progress in this increasingly important area. By releasing this large-scale
dataset, we hope to push the frontier of robotics, computer vision, and
foundation models.

Result: 在医学和自然图像恢复任务中，UGoDIT加速收敛并显著提升重建质量，性能接近SOTA方法。

Conclusion: UGoDIT在低数据量下表现出色，无需大量干净训练数据，为逆成像问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-centric deep generative models have led to
significant progress in solving inverse imaging problems. However, these models
(e.g., diffusion models (DMs)) typically require large amounts of fully sampled
(clean) training data, which is often impractical in medical and scientific
settings such as dynamic imaging.
  On the other hand, training-data-free approaches like the Deep Image Prior
(DIP) do not require clean ground-truth images but suffer from noise
overfitting and can be computationally expensive as the network parameters need
to be optimized for each measurement set independently. Moreover, DIP-based
methods often overlook the potential of learning a prior using a small number
of sub-sampled measurements (or degraded images) available during training. In
this paper, we propose UGoDIT, an Unsupervised Group DIP via Transferable
weights, designed for the low-data regime where only a very small number, M, of
sub-sampled measurement vectors are available during training. Our method
learns a set of transferable weights by optimizing a shared encoder and M
disentangled decoders. At test time, we reconstruct the unseen degraded image
using a DIP network, where part of the parameters are fixed to the learned
weights, while the remaining are optimized to enforce measurement consistency.
We evaluate UGoDIT on both medical (multi-coil MRI) and natural (super
resolution and non-linear deblurring) image recovery tasks under various
settings. Compared to recent standalone DIP methods, UGoDIT provides
accelerated convergence and notable improvement in reconstruction quality.
Furthermore, our method achieves performance competitive with SOTA DM-based and
supervised approaches, despite not requiring large amounts of clean training
data.

Conclusion: 该研究为游戏图形质量自动化评估奠定了基础，推动了无参考质量评估方法在游戏领域的应用。

Abstract: Assessing the visual quality of video game graphics presents unique
challenges due to the absence of reference images and the distinct types of
distortions, such as aliasing, texture blur, and geometry level of detail (LOD)
issues, which differ from those in natural images or user-generated content.
Existing no-reference image and video quality assessment (NR-IQA/VQA) methods
fail to generalize to gaming environments as they are primarily designed for
distortions like compression artifacts. This study introduces a
semantically-aware NR-IQA model tailored to gaming. The model employs a
knowledge-distilled Game distortion feature extractor (GDFE) to detect and
quantify game-specific distortions, while integrating semantic gating via CLIP
embeddings to dynamically weight feature importance based on scene content.
Training on gameplay data recorded across graphical quality presets enables the
model to produce quality scores that align with human perception. Our results
demonstrate that the GDFE, trained through knowledge distillation from binary
classifiers, generalizes effectively to intermediate distortion levels unseen
during training. Semantic gating further improves contextual relevance and
reduces prediction variance. In the absence of in-domain NR-IQA baselines, our
model outperforms out-of-domain methods and exhibits robust, monotonic quality
trends across unseen games in the same genre. This work establishes a
foundation for automated graphical quality assessment in gaming, advancing
NR-IQA methods in this domain.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing,
enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts.
While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use
poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To
this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing
diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert
the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features
as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked
regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using
a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures
accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual
similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency
regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of
subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and
model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We
additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images
addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results
demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by
text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics.
This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and
pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.

prediction. Evaluated across 15 benchmarks, it consistently surpasses existing
prompt- and adapter-based methods in all shot settings while remaining highly

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various visual
generation tasks, including image, video, and 3D content generation. Preference
optimization (PO) is a prominent and growing area of research that aims to
align these models with human preferences. While existing PO methods primarily
concentrate on producing favorable outputs, they often overlook the
significance of classifier-free guidance (CFG) in mitigating undesirable
results. Diffusion-NPO addresses this gap by introducing negative preference
optimization (NPO), training models to generate outputs opposite to human
preferences and thereby steering them away from unfavorable outcomes. However,
prior NPO approaches, including Diffusion-NPO, rely on costly and fragile
procedures for obtaining explicit preference annotations (e.g., manual pairwise
labeling or reward model training), limiting their practicality in domains
where such data are scarce or difficult to acquire. In this work, we introduce
Self-NPO, a Negative Preference Optimization approach that learns exclusively
from the model itself, thereby eliminating the need for manual data labeling or
reward model training. Moreover, our method is highly efficient and does not
require exhaustive data sampling. We demonstrate that Self-NPO integrates
seamlessly into widely used diffusion models, including SD1.5, SDXL, and
CogVideoX, as well as models already optimized for human preferences,
consistently enhancing both their generation quality and alignment with human
preferences.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) has attracted remarkable attention in hyperspectral
image (HSI) processing fields, and most existing deep learning (DL)-based
algorithms indicate dramatic potential for detecting anomaly samples through
specific training process under current scenario. However, the limited prior
information and the catastrophic forgetting problem indicate crucial challenges
for existing DL structure in open scenarios cross-domain detection. In order to
improve the detection performance, a novel continual learning-based capsule
differential generative adversarial network (CL-CaGAN) is proposed to elevate
the cross-scenario learning performance for facilitating the real application
of DL-based structure in hyperspectral AD (HAD) task. First, a modified capsule
structure with adversarial learning network is constructed to estimate the
background distribution for surmounting the deficiency of prior information. To
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, clustering-based sample replay
strategy and a designed extra self-distillation regularization are integrated
for merging the history and future knowledge in continual AD task, while the
discriminative learning ability from previous detection scenario to current
scenario is retained by the elaborately designed structure with continual
learning (CL) strategy. In addition, the differentiable enhancement is enforced
to augment the generation performance of the training data. This further
stabilizes the training process with better convergence and efficiently
consolidates the reconstruction ability of background samples. To verify the
effectiveness of our proposed CL-CaGAN, we conduct experiments on several real
HSIs, and the results indicate that the proposed CL-CaGAN demonstrates higher
detection performance and continuous learning capacity for mitigating the
catastrophic forgetting under cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Memory stability and learning flexibility in continual learning (CL) is a
core challenge for cross-scene Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD) task.
Biological neural networks can actively forget history knowledge that conflicts
with the learning of new experiences by regulating learning-triggered synaptic
expansion and synaptic convergence. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a
novel Biologically-Inspired Continual Learning Generative Adversarial Network
(CL-BioGAN) for augmenting continuous distribution fitting ability for
cross-domain HAD task, where Continual Learning Bio-inspired Loss (CL-Bio Loss)
and self-attention Generative Adversarial Network (BioGAN) are incorporated to
realize forgetting history knowledge as well as involving replay strategy in
the proposed BioGAN. Specifically, a novel Bio-Inspired Loss composed with an
Active Forgetting Loss (AF Loss) and a CL loss is designed to realize
parameters releasing and enhancing between new task and history tasks from a
Bayesian perspective. Meanwhile, BioGAN loss with L2-Norm enhances
self-attention (SA) to further balance the stability and flexibility for better
fitting background distribution for open scenario HAD (OHAD) tasks. Experiment
results underscore that the proposed CL-BioGAN can achieve more robust and
satisfying accuracy for cross-domain HAD with fewer parameters and computation
cost. This dual contribution not only elevates CL performance but also offers
new insights into neural adaptation mechanisms in OHAD task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自学习的自适应残差引导子空间扩散模型（ARGS-Diff），用于高光谱和多光谱图像融合，无需额外训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖大量高光谱数据进行监督训练，但实际应用中数据稀缺。

Method: 设计轻量级光谱和空间扩散模型，分别学习光谱和空间分布，并通过自适应残差引导模块优化重建过程。

Result: 实验表明ARGS-Diff在性能和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ARGS-Diff是一种高效且无需额外数据的HSI-MSI融合方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral and multispectral image (HSI-MSI) fusion involves combining a
low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution
multispectral image (HR-MSI) to generate a high-resolution hyperspectral image
(HR-HSI). Most deep learning-based methods for HSI-MSI fusion rely on large
amounts of hyperspectral data for supervised training, which is often scarce in
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-learning Adaptive
Residual Guided Subspace Diffusion Model (ARGS-Diff), which only utilizes the
observed images without any extra training data. Specifically, as the LR-HSI
contains spectral information and the HR-MSI contains spatial information, we
design two lightweight spectral and spatial diffusion models to separately
learn the spectral and spatial distributions from them. Then, we use these two
models to reconstruct HR-HSI from two low-dimensional components, i.e, the
spectral basis and the reduced coefficient, during the reverse diffusion
process. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Residual Guided Module (ARGM),
which refines the two components through a residual guided function at each
sampling step, thereby stabilizing the sampling process. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that ARGS-Diff outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency in the field
of HSI-MSI fusion. Code is available at https://github.com/Zhu1116/ARGS-Diff.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在不确定性和模糊输入下的鲁棒性有所提升，但仍存在过度自信的问题。通过简单提示模型避免不确定预测，可显著提升可靠性，但在领域特定任务中仍存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大规模视觉语言模型在面对不确定性和模糊输入时的鲁棒性表现，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过异常检测和模糊分类任务评估模型表现，并提出基于标题多样性的新机制来揭示模型内部不确定性。

Result: 新模型在自然图像任务中表现更好，但在领域特定任务中仍不可靠。通过提示机制可显著提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 模型在不确定输入下的表现仍需改进，提出的新机制为无标签数据下的不确定性预测提供了可能。

Abstract: Robustness against uncertain and ambiguous inputs is a critical challenge for
deep learning models. While recent advancements in large scale vision language
models (VLMs, e.g. GPT4o) might suggest that increasing model and training
dataset size would mitigate this issue, our empirical evaluation shows a more
complicated picture. Testing models using two classic uncertainty
quantification tasks, anomaly detection and classification under inherently
ambiguous conditions, we find that newer and larger VLMs indeed exhibit
improved robustness compared to earlier models, but still suffer from a
tendency to strictly follow instructions, often causing them to hallucinate
confident responses even when faced with unclear or anomalous inputs.
Remarkably, for natural images such as ImageNet, this limitation can be
overcome without pipeline modifications: simply prompting models to abstain
from uncertain predictions enables significant reliability gains, achieving
near-perfect robustness in several settings. However, for domain-specific tasks
such as galaxy morphology classification, a lack of specialized knowledge
prevents reliable uncertainty estimation. Finally, we propose a novel mechanism
based on caption diversity to reveal a model's internal uncertainty, enabling
practitioners to predict when models will successfully abstain without relying
on labeled data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图像的新方法，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）分析城市地标的可见性，补充了传统的视线（LoS）分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于几何交点的LoS方法无法捕捉城市地标在真实世界中的上下文和感知维度，因此需要一种更全面的可见性分析方法。

Method: 应用VLM检测方向放大的街景图像（SVI）中的目标对象，并构建异质可见性图来分析观察者与目标对象的复杂互动。

Result: 在第一个案例中，方法对全球六个高大地标的可见性检测准确率达87%；第二个案例揭示了伦敦泰晤士河沿岸地标的连接形式和强度。

Conclusion: 该方法补充并增强了传统LoS分析，为城市规划、遗产保护等提供了新视角。

Abstract: Visibility analysis is one of the fundamental analytics methods in urban
planning and landscape research, traditionally conducted through computational
simulations based on the Line-of-Sight (LoS) principle. However, when assessing
the visibility of named urban objects such as landmarks, geometric intersection
alone fails to capture the contextual and perceptual dimensions of visibility
as experienced in the real world. The study challenges the traditional
LoS-based approaches by introducing a new, image-based visibility analysis
method. Specifically, a Vision Language Model (VLM) is applied to detect the
target object within a direction-zoomed Street View Image (SVI). Successful
detection represents the object's visibility at the corresponding SVI location.
Further, a heterogeneous visibility graph is constructed to address the complex
interaction between observers and target objects. In the first case study, the
method proves its reliability in detecting the visibility of six tall landmark
constructions in global cities, with an overall accuracy of 87%. Furthermore,
it reveals broader contextual differences when the landmarks are perceived and
experienced. In the second case, the proposed visibility graph uncovers the
form and strength of connections for multiple landmarks along the River Thames
in London, as well as the places where these connections occur. Notably,
bridges on the River Thames account for approximately 30% of total connections.
Our method complements and enhances traditional LoS-based visibility analysis,
and showcases the possibility of revealing the prevalent connection of any
visual objects in the urban environment. It opens up new research perspectives
for urban planning, heritage conservation, and computational social science.

Abstract: Data augmentation for domain-specific image classification tasks often
struggles to simultaneously address diversity, faithfulness, and label clarity
of generated data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. While
existing generative diffusion model-based methods aim to enhance augmentation,
they fail to cohesively tackle these three critical aspects and often overlook
intrinsic challenges of diffusion models, such as sensitivity to model
characteristics and stochasticity under strong transformations. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework that explicitly integrates diversity,
faithfulness, and label clarity into the augmentation process. Our approach
employs saliency-guided mixing and a fine-tuned diffusion model to preserve
foreground semantics, enrich background diversity, and ensure label
consistency, while mitigating diffusion model limitations. Extensive
experiments across fine-grained, long-tail, few-shot, and background robustness
tasks demonstrate our method's superior performance over state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Current research has explored vision-language models for multi-modal
embedding tasks, such as information retrieval, visual grounding, and
classification. However, real-world scenarios often involve diverse modality
combinations between queries and targets, such as text and image to text, text
and image to text and image, and text to text and image. These diverse
combinations pose significant challenges for existing models, as they struggle
to align all modality combinations within a unified embedding space during
training, which degrades performance at inference. To address this limitation,
we propose UniMoCo, a novel vision-language model architecture designed for
multi-modal embedding tasks. UniMoCo introduces a modality-completion module
that generates visual features from textual inputs, ensuring modality
completeness for both queries and targets. Additionally, we develop a
specialized training strategy to align embeddings from both original and
modality-completed inputs, ensuring consistency within the embedding space.
This enables the model to robustly handle a wide range of modality combinations
across embedding tasks. Experiments show that UniMoCo outperforms previous
methods while demonstrating consistent robustness across diverse settings. More
importantly, we identify and quantify the inherent bias in conventional
approaches caused by imbalance of modality combinations in training data, which
can be mitigated through our modality-completion paradigm. The code is

Result: 在多个数据集上，CoSO在长任务序列场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoSO通过动态子空间优化和正交更新，有效提升了持续学习的性能和记忆效率。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to learn multiple tasks sequentially while preserving
prior knowledge, but faces the challenge of catastrophic forgetting when
acquiring new knowledge. Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models
have gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong
generalization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for
new tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts
parameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the
optimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,
resulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose
Continuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the
model in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential
subspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition
of gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these
subspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization. To mitigate forgetting, the
optimization subspaces of each task are set to be orthogonal to the historical
task subspace. During task learning, CoSO maintains a task-specific component
that captures the critical update directions associated with the current task.
Upon completing a task, this component is used to update the historical task
subspace, laying the groundwork for subsequent learning. Extensive experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate that CoSO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with long task
sequences.

Conclusion: CVD为跨视角地理定位提供了一种有效的解耦方法，可无缝集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same
geographic location captured from different perspectives, such as drones and
satellites. Despite recent advances, CVGL remains highly challenging due to
significant appearance changes and spatial distortions caused by viewpoint
variations. Existing methods typically assume that cross-view images can be
directly aligned within a shared feature space by maximizing feature similarity
through contrastive learning. Nonetheless, this assumption overlooks the
inherent conflicts induced by viewpoint discrepancies, resulting in extracted
features containing inconsistent information that hinders precise localization.
In this study, we take a manifold learning perspective and model the feature
space of cross-view images as a composite manifold jointly governed by content
and viewpoint information. Building upon this insight, we propose
$\textbf{CVD}$, a new CVGL framework that explicitly disentangles
$\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ factors. To promote effective
disentanglement, we introduce two constraints: $\textit{(i)}$ An intra-view
independence constraint, which encourages statistical independence between the
two factors by minimizing their mutual information. $\textit{(ii)}$ An
inter-view reconstruction constraint that reconstructs each view by
cross-combining $\textit{content}$ and $\textit{viewpoint}$ from paired images,
ensuring factor-specific semantics are preserved. As a plug-and-play module,
CVD can be seamlessly integrated into existing geo-localization pipelines.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks, i.e., University-1652, SUES-200,
CVUSA, and CVACT, demonstrate that CVD consistently improves both localization
accuracy and generalization across multiple baselines.

Method: 提出一种多视图训练方法：先为每个数据视图训练独立的扩散模型，再训练一个残差评分函数预测模型。理论分析表明，适当正则化可降低泛化误差。

Result: 证明了残差评分函数的训练难度与部分数据视图未捕捉的信号相关性成正比，方法的数据效率接近一阶最优。

Conclusion: 利用部分数据训练扩散模型可行，且通过多视图和残差评分函数方法能显著提高数据效率。

Abstract: Training diffusion models requires large datasets. However, acquiring large
volumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large
numbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are
many complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such
as low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data
include videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we
investigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be
utilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical
analysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training
diffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of
complementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first
trains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a
model for predicting the residual score function. We prove generalization error
bounds, which show that the proposed diffusion model training approach can
achieve lower generalization errors if proper regularizations are adopted in
the residual score function training. In particular, we prove that the
difficulty in training the residual score function scales proportionally with
the signal correlations not captured by partial data views. Consequently, the
proposed approach achieves near first-order optimal data efficiency.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of

gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we
propose CoT-Vid, a novel training-free paradigm for the video domain with a
multistage complex reasoning design. Distinguishing from existing video LLMs,
which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance
gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main
components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and
video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for
categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a
wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema
and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary
models, such as GPT-4V, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-flash. Our codebase will be

Conclusion: 通过RVT框架和DT技术，解决了视觉推理任务的多样性问题，并实现了零样本泛化的高效推理。

Abstract: Visual reasoning, the capability to interpret visual input in response to
implicit text query through multi-step reasoning, remains a challenge for deep
learning models due to the lack of relevant benchmarks. Previous work in visual
reasoning has primarily focused on reasoning segmentation, where models aim to
segment objects based on implicit text queries. This paper introduces reasoning
visual tasks (RVTs), a unified formulation that extends beyond traditional
video reasoning segmentation to a diverse family of visual language reasoning
problems, which can therefore accommodate multiple output formats including
bounding boxes, natural language descriptions, and question-answer pairs.
Correspondingly, we identify the limitations in current benchmark construction
methods that rely solely on large language models (LLMs), which inadequately
capture complex spatial-temporal relationships and multi-step reasoning chains
in video due to their reliance on token representation, resulting in benchmarks
with artificially limited reasoning complexity. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel automated RVT benchmark construction pipeline that leverages
digital twin (DT) representations as structured intermediaries between
perception and the generation of implicit text queries. Based on this method,
we construct RVTBench, a RVT benchmark containing 3,896 queries of over 1.2
million tokens across four types of RVT (segmentation, grounding, VQA and
summary), three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal), and
four increasing difficulty levels, derived from 200 video sequences. Finally,
we propose RVTagent, an agent framework for RVT that allows for zero-shot
generalization across various types of RVT without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) raises
safety concerns under potential malicious inputs. However, existing multimodal
safety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static
image inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct
safety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under
video-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48
fine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a
harmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears
harmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video. To
generate semantically accurate videos for safety evaluation, we design a
controllable pipeline that decomposes video semantics into subject images (what
is shown) and motion text (how it moves), which jointly guide the synthesis of
query-relevant videos. To effectively evaluate uncertain or borderline harmful
outputs, we propose RJScore, a novel LLM-based metric that incorporates the
confidence of judge models and human-aligned decision threshold calibration.
Extensive experiments show that benign-query video composition achieves average
attack success rates of 67.2%, revealing consistent vulnerabilities to
video-induced attacks. We believe Video-SafetyBench will catalyze future
research into video-based safety evaluation and defense strategies.

Abstract: Visual grounding is essential for precise perception and reasoning in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially in medical imaging
domains. While existing medical visual grounding benchmarks primarily focus on
single-image scenarios, real-world clinical applications often involve
sequential images, where accurate lesion localization across different
modalities and temporal tracking of disease progression (e.g., pre- vs.
post-treatment comparison) require fine-grained cross-image semantic alignment
and context-aware reasoning. To remedy the underrepresentation of image
sequences in existing medical visual grounding benchmarks, we propose
MedSG-Bench, the first benchmark tailored for Medical Image Sequences
Grounding. It comprises eight VQA-style tasks, formulated into two paradigms of
the grounding tasks, including 1) Image Difference Grounding, which focuses on
detecting change regions across images, and 2) Image Consistency Grounding,
which emphasizes detection of consistent or shared semantics across sequential
images. MedSG-Bench covers 76 public datasets, 10 medical imaging modalities,
and a wide spectrum of anatomical structures and diseases, totaling 9,630
question-answer pairs. We benchmark both general-purpose MLLMs (e.g.,
Qwen2.5-VL) and medical-domain specialized MLLMs (e.g., HuatuoGPT-vision),
observing that even the advanced models exhibit substantial limitations in
medical sequential grounding tasks. To advance this field, we construct
MedSG-188K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset tailored for sequential
visual grounding, and further develop MedSeq-Grounder, an MLLM designed to
facilitate future research on fine-grained understanding across medical
sequential images. The benchmark, dataset, and model are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目视频中零样本分析3D运动部分的创新框架，无需标注数据，适用于复杂运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集多视角图像或详细标注，限制了动态环境分析的灵活性和应用范围。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本条件下表现出高灵活性和潜力，适用于具身智能等领域。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing the motion parts and their motion attributes in dynamic
environments is crucial for advancing key areas such as embodied intelligence.
Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view
images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework
that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This
framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a
monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data.
Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly
analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth
estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then
employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we
introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically
designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to
ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex
movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and
versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method,
we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world
scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze
articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its
significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.

Conclusion: PRS-Med通过自然语言交互提升诊断效率，数据集和模型将开源以推动医学应用中的空间感知多模态推理研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in prompt-based medical image segmentation have enabled
clinicians to identify tumors using simple input like bounding boxes or text
prompts. However, existing methods face challenges when doctors need to
interact through natural language or when position reasoning is required -
understanding spatial relationships between anatomical structures and
pathologies. We present PRS-Med, a framework that integrates vision-language
models with segmentation capabilities to generate both accurate segmentation
masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. Additionally, we introduce
the MMRS dataset (Multimodal Medical in Positional Reasoning Segmentation),
which provides diverse, spatially-grounded question-answer pairs to address the
lack of position reasoning data in medical imaging. PRS-Med demonstrates
superior performance across six imaging modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, ultrasound,
endoscopy, RGB), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
segmentation accuracy and position reasoning. Our approach enables intuitive
doctor-system interaction through natural language, facilitating more efficient
diagnoses. Our dataset pipeline, model, and codebase will be released to foster
further research in spatially-aware multimodal reasoning for medical
applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种正交残差更新方法，通过分解模块输出并仅添加与输入流正交的分量，以增强特征学习和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准残差更新可能导致模块输出主要强化或调整现有流方向，未能充分利用模块学习全新特征的能力。

Method: 引入正交残差更新，分解模块输出并仅添加与输入流正交的分量。

Result: 在多种架构（ResNetV2、Vision Transformers）和数据集（CIFARs、TinyImageNet、ImageNet-1k）上提升了泛化精度和训练稳定性，例如ViT-B在ImageNet-1k上实现了+4.3%的top-1准确率提升。

Conclusion: 正交残差更新策略通过促进新特征方向的学习，显著提升了模型的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater
depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates,
the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to
updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction,
potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel
features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose
the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component
orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute
primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning
while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal
update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across
diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs,
TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\%p top-1 accuracy
gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.

Motivation: 现有生成式零样本学习方法依赖于专家标注的强类别语义向量，导致生成性能不佳和泛化能力有限。

Method: GenZSL通过弱类别语义向量（如CLIP文本嵌入）从相似类别中归纳新类样本，并结合类多样性提升和目标类引导的信息增强策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，GenZSL显著优于f-VAEGAN，性能提升24.7%，训练速度提升60倍以上。

Conclusion: GenZSL通过模仿人类概念学习，结合多样性提升和信息增强策略，为生成式零样本学习提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using
generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate
(imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic
vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance
and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose
an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed
GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting
new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors
derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the
generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our
GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity
promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it
utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the
model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets
showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy
and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7% performance gains and more than
$60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at

Motivation: 尽管统一多模态编码器在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在对抗扰动下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，这对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种对抗校准框架，通过模态特定的投影头（仅使用对抗样本训练）来提升鲁棒性，同时保持预训练编码器和语义中心不变。探索了三种训练目标，并引入正则化策略以确保模态一致性。

Result: 在六种模态和三种Bind风格模型上的实验表明，该方法在epsilon=4/255时将对抗鲁棒性提升高达47.3%，同时保持或提升干净数据的零样本和检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在不修改预训练模型的情况下显著提升了多模态编码器的对抗鲁棒性，且兼容现有基础模型。

Abstract: Recent unified multi-modal encoders align a wide range of modalities into a
shared representation space, enabling diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite their
impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial
perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for
safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find
that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops
across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are
especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade
significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration
framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying
pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing
foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads
trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and
embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center
cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial
InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure
modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and
three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by
up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean
zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法在细粒度视觉任务中表现不佳，因传统方法将教师模型的输出视为单一信号，导致学生模型无法捕捉细微的决策边界。

Method: FiGKD利用离散小波变换将教师模型的输出分解为低频（内容）和高频（细节）成分，仅选择性传递高频成分。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet等数据集上，FiGKD优于现有基于输出和特征的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 频率感知的分解方法能更高效地传递知识，尤其在资源受限的场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for transferring
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a smaller student model by
aligning their output distributions. However, existing methods often
underperform in fine-grained visual recognition tasks, where distinguishing
subtle differences between visually similar classes is essential. This
performance gap stems from the fact that conventional approaches treat the
teacher's output logits as a single, undifferentiated signal-assuming all
contained information is equally beneficial to the student. Consequently,
student models may become overloaded with redundant signals and fail to capture
the teacher's nuanced decision boundaries. To address this issue, we propose
Fine-Grained Knowledge Distillation (FiGKD), a novel frequency-aware framework
that decomposes a model's logits into low-frequency (content) and
high-frequency (detail) components using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT).
FiGKD selectively transfers only the high-frequency components, which encode
the teacher's semantic decision patterns, while discarding redundant
low-frequency content already conveyed through ground-truth supervision. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and requires no access to
intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet,
and multiple fine-grained recognition benchmarks show that FiGKD consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art logit-based and feature-based distillation methods
across a variety of teacher-student configurations. These findings confirm that
frequency-aware logit decomposition enables more efficient and effective
knowledge transfer, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Additionally, we present a benchmark covering these challenging object classes,

Abstract: The 180x360 omnidirectional field of view captured by 360-degree cameras
enables their use in a wide range of applications such as embodied AI and
virtual reality. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-spatial reasoning, most studies focus on
standard pinhole-view images, leaving omnidirectional perception largely
unexplored. In this paper, we ask: Are MLLMs ready for omnidirectional spatial
reasoning? To investigate this, we introduce OSR-Bench, the first benchmark
specifically designed for this setting. OSR-Bench includes over 153,000 diverse
question-answer pairs grounded in high-fidelity panoramic indoor scene maps. It
covers key reasoning types including object counting, relative distance, and
direction. We also propose a negative sampling strategy that inserts
non-existent objects into prompts to evaluate hallucination and grounding
robustness. For fine-grained analysis, we design a two-stage evaluation
framework assessing both cognitive map generation and QA accuracy using
rotation-invariant matching and a combination of rule-based and LLM-based
metrics. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5
Pro, and leading open-source models under zero-shot settings. Results show that
current models struggle with spatial reasoning in panoramic contexts,
highlighting the need for more perceptually grounded MLLMs. OSR-Bench and code

Conclusion: DC-Seg通过解耦表示和正则化设计，显著提升了多模态脑图像分割的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain images typically requires the integration of
complementary information from multiple image modalities. However, clinical
data for all modalities may not be available for every patient, creating a
significant challenge. To address this, previous studies encode multiple
modalities into a shared latent space. While somewhat effective, it remains
suboptimal, as each modality contains distinct and valuable information. In
this study, we propose DC-Seg (Disentangled Contrastive Learning for
Segmentation), a new method that explicitly disentangles images into
modality-invariant anatomical representation and modality-specific
representation, by using anatomical contrastive learning and modality
contrastive learning respectively. This solution improves the separation of
anatomical and modality-specific features by considering the modality gaps,
leading to more robust representations. Furthermore, we introduce a
segmentation-based regularizer that enhances the model's robustness to missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2020 and a private white matter
hyperintensity(WMH) segmentation dataset demonstrate that DC-Seg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in handling incomplete multimodal brain tumor
segmentation tasks with varying missing modalities, while also demonstrate
strong generalizability in WMH segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: SafeVid通过文本描述作为安全推理桥梁，显著提升VLMMs的安全性，并公开了数据集。

Abstract: As Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) rapidly advance, their inherent
complexity introduces significant safety challenges, particularly the issue of
mismatched generalization where static safety alignments fail to transfer to
dynamic video contexts. We introduce SafeVid, a framework designed to instill
video-specific safety principles in VLMMs. SafeVid uniquely transfers robust
textual safety alignment capabilities to the video domain by employing detailed
textual video descriptions as an interpretive bridge, facilitating LLM-based
rule-driven safety reasoning. This is achieved through a closed-loop system
comprising: 1) generation of SafeVid-350K, a novel 350,000-pair video-specific
safety preference dataset; 2) targeted alignment of VLMMs using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO); and 3) comprehensive evaluation via our new
SafeVidBench benchmark. Alignment with SafeVid-350K significantly enhances VLMM
safety, with models like LLaVA-NeXT-Video demonstrating substantial
improvements (e.g., up to 42.39%) on SafeVidBench. SafeVid provides critical
resources and a structured approach, demonstrating that leveraging textual
descriptions as a conduit for safety reasoning markedly improves the safety
alignment of VLMMs. We have made SafeVid-350K dataset

Result: iSegMan在3D场景操作和分割任务中表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: iSegMan通过高效区域控制和多功能工具箱，提升了场景操作的实用性和灵活性。

Abstract: The efficient rendering and explicit nature of 3DGS promote the advancement
of 3D scene manipulation. However, existing methods typically encounter
challenges in controlling the manipulation region and are unable to furnish the
user with interactive feedback, which inevitably leads to unexpected results.
Intuitively, incorporating interactive 3D segmentation tools can compensate for
this deficiency. Nevertheless, existing segmentation frameworks impose a
pre-processing step of scene-specific parameter training, which limits the
efficiency and flexibility of scene manipulation. To deliver a 3D region
control module that is well-suited for scene manipulation with reliable
efficiency, we propose interactive Segment-and-Manipulate 3D Gaussians
(iSegMan), an interactive segmentation and manipulation framework that only
requires simple 2D user interactions in any view. To propagate user
interactions to other views, we propose Epipolar-guided Interaction Propagation
(EIP), which innovatively exploits epipolar constraint for efficient and robust
interaction matching. To avoid scene-specific training to maintain efficiency,
we further propose the novel Visibility-based Gaussian Voting (VGV), which
obtains 2D segmentations from SAM and models the region extraction as a voting
game between 2D Pixels and 3D Gaussians based on Gaussian visibility. Taking
advantage of the efficient and precise region control of EIP and VGV, we put
forth a Manipulation Toolbox to implement various functions on selected
regions, enhancing the controllability, flexibility and practicality of scene
manipulation. Extensive results on 3D scene manipulation and segmentation tasks
fully demonstrate the significant advantages of iSegMan. Project page is

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少了75-95%的视觉标记，同时在12个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Meteor在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率，为视觉指令调优提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning aims to enable large language models to comprehend
the visual world, with a pivotal challenge lying in establishing an effective
vision-to-language projection. However, existing methods often grapple with the
intractable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we
present LLaVA-Meteor, a novel approach designed to break this deadlock,
equipped with a novel Top-Down Compression paradigm that strategically
compresses visual tokens without compromising core information. Specifically,
we construct a trainable Flash Global Fusion module based on efficient
selective state space operators, which aligns the feature space while enabling
each token to perceive holistic visual context and instruction preference at
low cost. Furthermore, a local-to-single scanning manner is employed to
effectively capture local dependencies, thereby enhancing the model's
capability in vision modeling. To alleviate computational overhead, we explore
a Visual-Native Selection mechanism that independently assesses token
significance by both the visual and native experts, followed by aggregation to
retain the most critical subset. Extensive experiments show that our approach
reduces visual tokens by 75--95% while achieving comparable or superior
performance across 12 benchmarks, significantly improving efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了P&ID手动映射的问题，为后续自动化任务提供了基础。

Abstract: Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) constitute the foundational
blueprint of a plant, depicting the interconnections among process equipment,
instrumentation for process control, and the flow of fluids and control
signals. In their existing setup, the manual mapping of information from P&ID
sheets holds a significant challenge. This is a time-consuming process, taking
around 3-6 months, and is susceptible to errors. It also depends on the
expertise of the domain experts and often requires multiple rounds of review.
The digitization of P&IDs entails merging detected line segments, which is
essential for linking various detected instruments, thereby creating a
comprehensive digitized P&ID. This paper focuses on explaining how line
segments which are detected using a computer vision model are merged and
eventually building the connection between equipment and merged lines. Hence
presenting a digitized form of information stating the interconnection between
process equipment, instrumentation, flow of fluids and control signals.
Eventually, which can be stored in a knowledge graph and that information along
with the help of advanced algorithms can be leveraged for tasks like finding
optimal routes, detecting system cycles, computing transitive closures, and
more.

TL;DR: AoP-SAM是一种自动生成SAM模型提示的新方法，通过轻量级Prompt Predictor模型和自适应采样过滤机制，显著提升了SAM的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动为SAM模型提供提示不适用于实际应用，尤其是在需要快速响应和资源效率的场景中。

Method: AoP-SAM使用Prompt Predictor模型自动检测图像中的关键实体并生成提示，同时采用自适应采样过滤机制优化提示和掩模生成。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估表明，AoP-SAM显著提升了提示生成效率和掩模生成准确性。

Conclusion: AoP-SAM通过自动化提示生成，使SAM更适合实际自动化分割任务。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a powerful foundation model for image
segmentation, showing robust zero-shot generalization through prompt
engineering. However, relying on manual prompts is impractical for real-world
applications, particularly in scenarios where rapid prompt provision and
resource efficiency are crucial. In this paper, we propose the Automation of
Prompts for SAM (AoP-SAM), a novel approach that learns to generate essential
prompts in optimal locations automatically. AoP-SAM enhances SAM's efficiency
and usability by eliminating manual input, making it better suited for
real-world tasks. Our approach employs a lightweight yet efficient Prompt
Predictor model that detects key entities across images and identifies the
optimal regions for placing prompt candidates. This method leverages SAM's
image embeddings, preserving its zero-shot generalization capabilities without
requiring fine-tuning. Additionally, we introduce a test-time instance-level
Adaptive Sampling and Filtering mechanism that generates prompts in a
coarse-to-fine manner. This notably enhances both prompt and mask generation
efficiency by reducing computational overhead and minimizing redundant mask
refinements. Evaluations of three datasets demonstrate that AoP-SAM
substantially improves both prompt generation efficiency and mask generation
accuracy, making SAM more effective for automated segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的在线迭代自对齐（OISA）方法，用于放射学报告生成（RRG），通过自生成数据、自评估、自对齐和自迭代优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RRG模型依赖有限的高质量标注数据，容易过拟合和泛化能力不足，需要一种更高效的方法提升模型性能。

Method: OISA方法包括四个阶段：自生成多样化数据、自评估多目标偏好数据、自对齐多目标优化和自迭代进一步改进。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多项评估指标上优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: OISA方法通过迭代多目标优化显著提升数据质量和模型性能，为RRG提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important research topic for
relieving radiologist' heavy workload. Existing RRG models mainly rely on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data
pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports.
Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG
model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL).
However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks
of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative
Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages:
self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference
data,self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for
further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored
to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG
model iteratively. Unlike existing methods, our frame-work significantly
increases data quality and optimizes performance through iterative
multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
surpasses previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across
multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出SpatialCrafter框架，利用视频扩散模型生成多视角观测，解决稀疏或单视角输入的3D场景重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术依赖密集多视角观测，限制了应用范围。本文旨在从稀疏或单视角输入重建逼真3D场景。

Method: 结合可训练相机编码器、极线注意力机制和统一尺度估计策略，利用视频扩散模型生成额外观测。整合单目深度先验与语义特征，直接回归3D高斯基元。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了稀疏视角重建效果，恢复了3D场景的真实外观。

Conclusion: SpatialCrafter通过几何约束和多模态特征整合，有效解决了稀疏输入下的3D重建问题。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) boosts immersive experiences in computer vision
and graphics. Existing techniques, though progressed, rely on dense multi-view
observations, restricting their application. This work takes on the challenge
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from sparse or single-view inputs.
We introduce SpatialCrafter, a framework that leverages the rich knowledge in
video diffusion models to generate plausible additional observations, thereby
alleviating reconstruction ambiguity. Through a trainable camera encoder and an
epipolar attention mechanism for explicit geometric constraints, we achieve
precise camera control and 3D consistency, further reinforced by a unified
scale estimation strategy to handle scale discrepancies across datasets.
Furthermore, by integrating monocular depth priors with semantic features in
the video latent space, our framework directly regresses 3D Gaussian primitives
and efficiently processes long-sequence features using a hybrid network
structure. Extensive experiments show our method enhances sparse view
reconstruction and restores the realistic appearance of 3D scenes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合超图学习和模态再平衡机制的多模态生存预测框架，显著提升了癌症生存预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多采用多实例学习整合病理图像特征，但忽略了上下文和层次细节的信息丢失，且病理与基因组数据间的粒度差异导致模态不平衡。

Method: 提出超图学习捕获病理图像的上下文和层次细节，采用模态再平衡机制和交互对齐融合策略动态调整两模态贡献。

Result: 在五个TCGA数据集上，模型C-Index性能优于先进方法3.4%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了病理-基因组模态不平衡问题，提升了生存预测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal pathology-genomic analysis has become increasingly prominent in
cancer survival prediction. However, existing studies mainly utilize
multi-instance learning to aggregate patch-level features, neglecting the
information loss of contextual and hierarchical details within pathology
images. Furthermore, the disparity in data granularity and dimensionality
between pathology and genomics leads to a significant modality imbalance. The
high spatial resolution inherent in pathology data renders it a dominant role
while overshadowing genomics in multimodal integration. In this paper, we
propose a multimodal survival prediction framework that incorporates hypergraph
learning to effectively capture both contextual and hierarchical details from
pathology images. Moreover, it employs a modality rebalance mechanism and an
interactive alignment fusion strategy to dynamically reweight the contributions
of the two modalities, thereby mitigating the pathology-genomics imbalance.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on five TCGA datasets,
demonstrating that our model outperforms advanced methods by over 3.4\% in
C-Index performance.

TL;DR: IQBench是一个新的视觉IQ测试基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推理能力，强调图像信息而非文本知识。实验显示模型在3D空间和字谜任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在人类IQ测试中的真实推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 手动收集并标注500个视觉IQ问题，评估模型的解释、推理模式和最终答案准确性。

Result: 模型如o4-mini、gemini-2.5-flash和claude-3.7-sonnet表现最佳，但在3D空间和字谜任务上仍有明显不足。

Conclusion: VLMs的推理能力与最终答案存在不一致，需同时评估推理过程和预测准确性。

Abstract: Although large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks, their true reasoning
capabilities on human IQ tests remain underexplored. To advance research on the
fluid intelligence of VLMs, we introduce **IQBench**, a new benchmark designed
to evaluate VLMs on standardized visual IQ tests. We focus on evaluating the
reasoning capabilities of VLMs, which we argue are more important than the
accuracy of the final prediction. **Our benchmark is visually centric,
minimizing the dependence on unnecessary textual content**, thus encouraging
models to derive answers primarily from image-based information rather than
learned textual knowledge. To this end, we manually collected and annotated 500
visual IQ questions to **prevent unintentional data leakage during training**.
Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on the accuracy of the final answer,
we evaluate the reasoning ability of the models by assessing their explanations
and the patterns used to solve each problem, along with the accuracy of the
final prediction and human evaluation. Our experiments show that there are
substantial performance disparities between tasks, with models such as
`o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet` achieving the highest
average accuracies of 0.615, 0.578, and 0.548, respectively. However, all
models struggle with 3D spatial and anagram reasoning tasks, highlighting
significant limitations in current VLMs' general reasoning abilities. In terms
of reasoning scores, `o4-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, and `claude-3.7-sonnet`
achieved top averages of 0.696, 0.586, and 0.516, respectively. These results
highlight inconsistencies between the reasoning processes of the models and
their final answers, emphasizing the importance of evaluating the accuracy of
the reasoning in addition to the final predictions.

TL;DR: CHRIS方法通过侧视图一致性提升单视角RGB图像中穿衣人体重建的全局和局部一致性，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视角图像仅包含正面信息，导致侧视图拓扑和表面不一致，限制了重建效果。

Method: 提出CHRIS方法，包括侧视图法线判别器和多对一梯度计算（M2O），分别增强全局合理性和局部一致性。

Result: 实验表明CHRIS在公开基准上达到最优性能，优于先前工作。

Conclusion: CHRIS通过侧视图一致性解决了单视角重建的局限性，显著提升了效果。

Abstract: Creating a realistic clothed human from a single-view RGB image is crucial
for applications like mixed reality and filmmaking. Despite some progress in
recent years, mainstream methods often fail to fully utilize side-view
information, as the input single-view image contains front-view information
only. This leads to globally unrealistic topology and local surface
inconsistency in side views. To address these, we introduce Clothed Human
Reconstruction with Side View Consistency, namely CHRIS, which consists of 1) A
Side-View Normal Discriminator that enhances global visual reasonability by
distinguishing the generated side-view normals from the ground truth ones; 2) A
Multi-to-One Gradient Computation (M2O) that ensures local surface consistency.
M2O calculates the gradient of a sampling point by integrating the gradients of
the nearby points, effectively acting as a smooth operation. Experimental
results demonstrate that CHRIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on public
benchmarks and outperforms the prior work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态协作优化与扩展网络（MCO-E Net），用于解决单眼表情识别任务中的低光、高曝光和高动态范围问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单眼表情识别在低光、高曝光和高动态范围条件下表现不佳，需要多模态协作优化来解决这些挑战。

Method: MCO-E Net包含两个创新设计：MCO-Mamba（利用双模态信息联合优化模型）和HCE-MoE（通过动态路由机制分配异构专家，促进互补语义学习）。

Result: 实验表明，该网络在单眼表情识别任务中表现优异，尤其在恶劣光照条件下。

Conclusion: MCO-E Net通过多模态协作和异构专家集成，显著提升了单眼表情识别的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization and
Expansion Network (MCO-E Net), to use event modalities to resist challenges
such as low light, high exposure, and high dynamic range in single-eye
expression recognition tasks. The MCO-E Net introduces two innovative designs:
Multi-modal Collaborative Optimization Mamba (MCO-Mamba) and Heterogeneous
Collaborative and Expansion Mixture-of-Experts (HCE-MoE). MCO-Mamba, building
upon Mamba, leverages dual-modal information to jointly optimize the model,
facilitating collaborative interaction and fusion of modal semantics. This
approach encourages the model to balance the learning of both modalities and
harness their respective strengths. HCE-MoE, on the other hand, employs a
dynamic routing mechanism to distribute structurally varied experts (deep,
attention, and focal), fostering collaborative learning of complementary
semantics. This heterogeneous architecture systematically integrates diverse
feature extraction paradigms to comprehensively capture expression semantics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed network achieves
competitive performance in the task of single-eye expression recognition,
especially under poor lighting conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对EHPS模型的不可察觉黑盒攻击方法（UBA），通过潜在空间表示生成对抗噪声，显著提高了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EHPS模型关注估计误差，忽视安全漏洞；现有攻击方法需白盒访问或生成明显扰动，实用性有限。

Method: 利用自然图像的潜在空间表示生成对抗噪声，通过迭代优化攻击方向和隐蔽性。

Result: UBA平均增加EHPS模型姿态估计误差17.27%-58.21%，揭示了严重安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 数字人生成系统的安全风险亟需解决。

Abstract: Expressive human pose and shape (EHPS) estimation is vital for digital human
generation, particularly in live-streaming applications. However, most existing
EHPS models focus primarily on minimizing estimation errors, with limited
attention on potential security vulnerabilities. Current adversarial attacks on
EHPS models often require white-box access (e.g., model details or gradients)
or generate visually conspicuous perturbations, limiting their practicality and
ability to expose real-world security threats. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Unnoticeable Black-Box Attack (UBA) against EHPS models. UBA
leverages the latent-space representations of natural images to generate an
optimal adversarial noise pattern and iteratively refine its attack potency
along an optimized direction in digital space. Crucially, this process relies
solely on querying the model's output, requiring no internal knowledge of the
EHPS architecture, while guiding the noise optimization toward greater stealth
and effectiveness. Extensive experiments and visual analyses demonstrate the
superiority of UBA. Notably, UBA increases the pose estimation errors of EHPS
models by 17.27%-58.21% on average, revealing critical vulnerabilities. These
findings underscore the urgent need to address and mitigate security risks
associated with digital human generation systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于少量样本正交对齐的方法，用于在不同预训练模型间对齐任务向量，提升跨模型迁移的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术假设源模型和目标模型从相同的预训练参数初始化，限制了其在跨模型迁移场景中的应用。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 采用少量样本正交对齐方法，将任务向量对齐到不同预训练目标模型的参数空间，保持向量的关键属性（如范数和秩）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在8个分类数据集上优于直接应用任务向量，性能接近少量样本微调，同时保持了任务向量的模块化和可重用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨模型迁移中的任务向量对齐问题，提升了迁移准确性，同时保留了任务向量的优势。

Abstract: Task arithmetic enables efficient model editing by representing task-specific
changes as vectors in parameter space. Task arithmetic typically assumes that
the source and target models are initialized from the same pre-trained
parameters. This assumption limits its applicability in cross-model transfer
settings, where models are independently pre-trained on different datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a method based on few-shot orthogonal
alignment, which aligns task vectors to the parameter space of a differently
pre-trained target model. These transformations preserve key properties of task
vectors, such as norm and rank, and are learned using only a small number of
labeled examples. We evaluate the method using two Vision Transformers
pre-trained on YFCC100M and LAION400M, and test on eight classification
datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves transfer accuracy
over direct task vector application and achieves performance comparable to
few-shot fine-tuning, while maintaining the modularity and reusability of task
vectors. Our code is available at

Result: 实验证明FIGhost对先进检测器和VLMs有效，且在不同环境下保持鲁棒性并能规避现有防御。

Conclusion: FIGhost为物理世界后门攻击提供了新的隐蔽且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems are crucial for autonomous driving but
are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing physical backdoor attacks either
lack stealth, provide inflexible attack control, or ignore emerging
Vision-Large-Language-Models (VLMs). In this paper, we introduce FIGhost, the
first physical-world backdoor attack leveraging fluorescent ink as triggers.
Fluorescent triggers are invisible under normal conditions and activated
stealthily by ultraviolet light, providing superior stealthiness, flexibility,
and untraceability. Inspired by real-world graffiti, we derive realistic
trigger shapes and enhance their robustness via an interpolation-based
fluorescence simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we develop an automated
backdoor sample generation method to support three attack objectives. Extensive
evaluations in the physical world demonstrate FIGhost's effectiveness against
state-of-the-art detectors and VLMs, maintaining robustness under environmental
variations and effectively evading existing defenses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种时间-空间感知采样策略（TSS），用于加速扩散超分辨率（SR）任务，无需额外训练成本。TSS结合了时间动态采样（TDS）和空间动态采样（SDS），显著减少了迭代次数，同时提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的SR方法计算成本高，且现有加速技术未能充分利用低层任务（如SR）的特性。

Method: 通过分析扩散SR方法的频域和空间域特性，提出TSS策略，结合TDS和SDS动态优化采样过程。

Result: TSS在多个基准测试中表现优异，仅用一半的迭代步骤即达到SOTA性能，MUSIQ分数提升0.2-3.0。

Conclusion: TSS为扩散SR任务提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的加速方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained attention for their success in modeling complex
distributions, achieving impressive perceptual quality in SR tasks. However,
existing diffusion-based SR methods often suffer from high computational costs,
requiring numerous iterative steps for training and inference. Existing
acceleration techniques, such as distillation and solver optimization, are
generally task-agnostic and do not fully leverage the specific characteristics
of low-level tasks like super-resolution (SR). In this study, we analyze the
frequency- and spatial-domain properties of diffusion-based SR methods,
revealing key insights into the temporal and spatial dependencies of
high-frequency signal recovery. Specifically, high-frequency details benefit
from concentrated optimization during early and late diffusion iterations,
while spatially textured regions demand adaptive denoising strategies. Building
on these observations, we propose the Time-Spatial-aware Sampling strategy
(TSS) for the acceleration of Diffusion SR without any extra training cost. TSS
combines Time Dynamic Sampling (TDS), which allocates more iterations to
refining textures, and Spatial Dynamic Sampling (SDS), which dynamically
adjusts strategies based on image content. Extensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TSS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance with significantly fewer iterations, improving MUSIQ scores by 0.2
- 3.0 and outperforming the current acceleration methods with only half the
number of steps.

Motivation: 现有基于潜在扩散模型的视频生成框架因固定时间压缩率导致计算成本随帧率线性增长，效率低下。

Method: 提出Duration-Proportional Information Assumption，并设计VFRTok实现可变帧率编码/解码，引入Partial Rotary Position Embeddings提升内容感知。

Result: VFRTok仅需1/8的token即可达到竞争性重建质量和最先进生成保真度。

Conclusion: VFRTok通过紧凑连续的时空表示显著提升了视频生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Modern video generation frameworks based on Latent Diffusion Models suffer
from inefficiencies in tokenization due to the Frame-Proportional Information
Assumption. Existing tokenizers provide fixed temporal compression rates,
causing the computational cost of the diffusion model to scale linearly with
the frame rate. The paper proposes the Duration-Proportional Information
Assumption: the upper bound on the information capacity of a video is
proportional to the duration rather than the number of frames. Based on this
insight, the paper introduces VFRTok, a Transformer-based video tokenizer, that
enables variable frame rate encoding and decoding through asymmetric frame rate
training between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, the paper proposes
Partial Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to decouple position and content
modeling, which groups correlated patches into unified tokens. The Partial RoPE
effectively improves content-awareness, enhancing the video generation
capability. Benefiting from the compact and continuous spatio-temporal
representation, VFRTok achieves competitive reconstruction quality and
state-of-the-art generation fidelity while using only 1/8 tokens compared to
existing tokenizers.

Abstract: Very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has emerged as a powerful tool
for monitoring marine animals on a large scale. However, existing deep
learning-based whale detection methods usually require manually created,
high-quality bounding box annotations, which are labor-intensive to produce.
Moreover, existing studies often exclude ``uncertain whales'', individuals that
have ambiguous appearances in satellite imagery, limiting the applicability of
these models in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this study
introduces an automated pipeline for detecting beluga whales and harp seals in
VHR satellite imagery. The pipeline leverages point annotations and the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to generate precise bounding box annotations, which are
used to train YOLOv8 for multiclass detection of certain whales, uncertain
whales, and harp seals. Experimental results demonstrated that SAM-generated
annotations significantly improved detection performance, achieving higher
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-scores compared to traditional buffer-based annotations.
YOLOv8 trained on SAM-labeled boxes achieved an overall
$\text{F}_\text{1}$-score of 72.2% for whales overall and 70.3% for harp seals,
with superior performance in dense scenes. The proposed approach not only
reduces the manual effort required for annotation but also enhances the
detection of uncertain whales, offering a more comprehensive solution for
marine animal monitoring. This method holds great potential for extending to
other species, habitats, and remote sensing platforms, as well as for
estimating whale biometrics, thereby advancing ecological monitoring and
conservation efforts. The codes for our label and detection pipeline are
publicly available at http://github.com/voyagerxvoyagerx/beluga-seeker .

Conclusion: MT-CYP-Net为稀疏标签下的作物产量预测提供了有效解决方案，推动了精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate and fine-grained crop yield prediction plays a crucial role in
advancing global agriculture. However, the accuracy of pixel-level yield
estimation based on satellite remote sensing data has been constrained by the
scarcity of ground truth data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
approach called the Multi-Task Crop Yield Prediction Network (MT-CYP-Net). This
framework introduces an effective multi-task feature-sharing strategy, where
features extracted from a shared backbone network are simultaneously utilized
by both crop yield prediction decoders and crop classification decoders with
the ability to fuse information between them. This design allows MT-CYP-Net to
be trained with extremely sparse crop yield point labels and crop type labels,
while still generating detailed pixel-level crop yield maps. Concretely, we
collected 1,859 yield point labels along with corresponding crop type labels
and satellite images from eight farms in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2023,
covering soybean, maize, and rice crops, and constructed a sparse crop yield
label dataset. MT-CYP-Net is compared with three classical machine learning and
deep learning benchmark methods in this dataset. Experimental results not only
indicate the superiority of MT-CYP-Net compared to previous methods on multiple
types of crops but also demonstrate the potential of deep networks on precise
pixel-level crop yield prediction, especially with limited data labels.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公共病理数据集上提升了双级MIL算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了MIL在数字病理学中的分类性能，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image
classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to
supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained
annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag-
and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue,
instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the
prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving
the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We
propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised
learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with
pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong
generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of
dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions.
Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed

Result: 在COCO（检测）、ReasonSeg（分割）和CountBench（计数）任务中，分别比Qwen2.5VL提升了29.1%、22.1%和15.3%。

Conclusion: VisionReasoner作为一个统一模型，在多样化视觉感知任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models exhibit inherent capabilities to handle diverse
visual perception tasks. In this paper, we introduce VisionReasoner, a unified
framework capable of reasoning and solving multiple visual perception tasks
within a shared model. Specifically, by designing novel multi-object cognitive
learning strategies and systematic task reformulation, VisionReasoner enhances
its reasoning capabilities to analyze visual inputs, and addresses diverse
perception tasks in a unified framework. The model generates a structured
reasoning process before delivering the desired outputs responding to user
queries. To rigorously assess unified visual perception capabilities, we
evaluate VisionReasoner on ten diverse tasks spanning three critical domains:
detection, segmentation, and counting. Experimental results show that
VisionReasoner achieves superior performance as a unified model, outperforming
Qwen2.5VL by relative margins of 29.1% on COCO (detection), 22.1% on ReasonSeg
(segmentation), and 15.3% on CountBench (counting).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成视频在感知质量和文本对齐性上存在不足，需要可靠且可扩展的自动评估模型。

Method: 构建了包含60K标注的AIGVE-60K数据集，并提出基于LMM的LOVE评估指标，从多维度评估视频质量。

Result: LOVE在AIGVE-60K上表现优异，且能泛化到其他评估基准。

Conclusion: AIGVE-60K数据集和LOVE指标为AI生成视频的评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have driven substantial
progress in both text-to-video (T2V) generation and video-to-text (V2T)
interpretation tasks. However, current AI-generated videos (AIGVs) still
exhibit limitations in terms of perceptual quality and text-video alignment.
Therefore, a reliable and scalable automatic model for AIGV evaluation is
desirable, which heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations.
To this end, we present AIGVE-60K, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for
AI-Generated Video Evaluation, which features (i) comprehensive tasks,
encompassing 3,050 extensive prompts across 20 fine-grained task dimensions,
(ii) the largest human annotations, including 120K mean-opinion scores (MOSs)
and 60K question-answering (QA) pairs annotated on 58,500 videos generated from
30 T2V models, and (iii) bidirectional benchmarking and evaluating for both T2V
generation and V2T interpretation capabilities. Based on AIGVE-60K, we propose
LOVE, a LMM-based metric for AIGV Evaluation from multiple dimensions including
perceptual preference, text-video correspondence, and task-specific accuracy in
terms of both instance level and model level. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LOVE not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
AIGVE-60K dataset, but also generalizes effectively to a wide range of other
AIGV evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight the significance of the
AIGVE-60K dataset. Database and codes are anonymously available at

Result: TinyRS-R1在分类、VQA、视觉定位和开放式问答任务中表现优于或接近7B参数模型，且资源需求仅为三分之一。

Conclusion: TinyRS-R1是首个针对遥感任务的GRPO对齐CoT推理MSLM，展示了小型模型在特定领域的潜力。

Abstract: Remote-sensing applications often run on edge hardware that cannot host
today's 7B-parameter multimodal language models. This paper introduces TinyRS,
the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for
remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built
upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training
on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples,
fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning
dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1
achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing
models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question
answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our
analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and
scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise,
latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized
MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.

Conclusion: EarthSynth是首个探索多任务生成的遥感模型，通过合成数据显著提升了遥感图像解释的性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) interpretation typically faces challenges due to
the scarcity of labeled data, which limits the performance of RSI
interpretation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a
diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing
multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI
interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to
explore multi-task generation for remote sensing. EarthSynth, trained on the
EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training
strategy to improve training data diversity and enhance category control.
Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more
informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on
scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world
scenarios, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重叠关节或快速变化姿态的场景中表现不佳，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Result: 在CrowdPose、OCHuman和COCO基准测试中表现出色，兼具准确性和运行时性能。

Conclusion: KDC方法在复杂场景中具有高效性和通用性，为人体姿态估计和分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: The dynamic movement of the human body presents a fundamental challenge for
human pose estimation and body segmentation. State-of-the-art approaches
primarily rely on combining keypoint heatmaps with segmentation masks but often
struggle in scenarios involving overlapping joints or rapidly changing poses
during instance-level segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose
Keypoints as Dynamic Centroid (KDC), a new centroid-based representation for
unified human pose estimation and instance-level segmentation. KDC adopts a
bottom-up paradigm to generate keypoint heatmaps for both easily
distinguishable and complex keypoints and improves keypoint detection and
confidence scores by introducing KeyCentroids using a keypoint disk. It
leverages high-confidence keypoints as dynamic centroids in the embedding space
to generate MaskCentroids, allowing for swift clustering of pixels to specific
human instances during rapid body movements in live environments. Our
experimental evaluations on the CrowdPose, OCHuman, and COCO benchmarks
demonstrate KDC's effectiveness and generalizability in challenging scenarios
in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance. The implementation is

Method: 提出多模态Transformer框架，利用电影数据生成伪数据模拟真实场景，通过分离、调整和重混三步训练模型。

Result: 方法在定量和主观评估中均优于基线，并研究了不同上下文指导和数据集难度的影响。

Conclusion: 视觉引导的音频高亮任务有效，多模态框架和伪数据生成方法为音视频处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant increase in video content creation and
consumption. Crafting engaging content requires the careful curation of both
visual and audio elements. While visual cue curation, through techniques like
optimal viewpoint selection or post-editing, has been central to media
production, its natural counterpart, audio, has not undergone equivalent
advancements. This often results in a disconnect between visual and acoustic
saliency. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: visually-guided
acoustic highlighting, which aims to transform audio to deliver appropriate
highlighting effects guided by the accompanying video, ultimately creating a
more harmonious audio-visual experience. We propose a flexible,
transformer-based multimodal framework to solve this task. To train our model,
we also introduce a new dataset -- the muddy mix dataset, leveraging the
meticulous audio and video crafting found in movies, which provides a form of
free supervision. We develop a pseudo-data generation process to simulate
poorly mixed audio, mimicking real-world scenarios through a three-step process
-- separation, adjustment, and remixing. Our approach consistently outperforms
several baselines in both quantitative and subjective evaluation. We also
systematically study the impact of different types of contextual guidance and
difficulty levels of the dataset. Our project page is here:

*Ranit Karmakar,Simon F. Nørrelykke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的实例分割评估指标SoftPQ，通过引入可调的上限和下限IoU阈值，将评估从二元分类转变为连续梯度，从而更灵活地反映分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割评估指标（如PQ）依赖硬阈值匹配，将预测结果简单地分为正确或错误，忽略了错误之间的质量差异，且无法逐步奖励模型改进。

Method: SoftPQ通过定义部分匹配区域和应用次线性惩罚函数，重新设计评估为连续梯度，引入可调IoU阈值以处理模糊或碎片化预测。

Result: 实验表明，SoftPQ能更平滑地反映分割质量差异，对结构分割错误更具鲁棒性，并为模型开发提供更有意义的反馈。

Conclusion: SoftPQ是一种实用且原则性的替代方案，适用于基准测试和迭代模型优化，能够捕捉现有指标忽略的分割质量差异。

Abstract: Segmentation evaluation metrics traditionally rely on binary decision logic:
predictions are either correct or incorrect, based on rigid IoU thresholds.
Detection--based metrics such as F1 and mAP determine correctness at the object
level using fixed overlap cutoffs, while overlap--based metrics like
Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice operate at the pixel level, often
overlooking instance--level structure. Panoptic Quality (PQ) attempts to unify
detection and segmentation assessment, but it remains dependent on
hard-threshold matching--treating predictions below the threshold as entirely
incorrect. This binary framing obscures important distinctions between
qualitatively different errors and fails to reward gradual model improvements.
We propose SoftPQ, a flexible and interpretable instance segmentation metric
that redefines evaluation as a graded continuum rather than a binary
classification. SoftPQ introduces tunable upper and lower IoU thresholds to
define a partial matching region and applies a sublinear penalty function to
ambiguous or fragmented predictions. These extensions allow SoftPQ to exhibit
smoother score behavior, greater robustness to structural segmentation errors,
and more informative feedback for model development and evaluation. Through
controlled perturbation experiments, we show that SoftPQ captures meaningful
differences in segmentation quality that existing metrics overlook, making it a
practical and principled alternative for both benchmarking and iterative model
refinement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督学习框架，能够在噪声数据上学习鲁棒表示，无需在推理或下游任务中使用去噪器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习通常针对干净数据集，而噪声数据的应用需求迫切，如天体物理学、医学影像等领域。

Method: 首先训练一个自监督去噪器，然后构建从去噪到噪声的数据课程，结合教师引导正则化，预训练自监督骨干网络。

Result: 在极端高斯噪声下，线性探测准确率比DINOv2提高了4.8%。

Conclusion: 通过噪声感知预训练，可以实现无需去噪器的鲁棒性，简化部署。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich
representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on
clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy
data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as
astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present
a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation
learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning.
Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to
construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on
denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2),
combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to
their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize
noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining,
simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise
($\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by
4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from
noise-aware pretraining. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACDepth的鲁棒单目深度估计方法，通过高质量训练数据生成和域适应解决恶劣天气下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恶劣天气下性能下降，主要由于域偏移和场景信息提取困难。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成模拟恶劣天气的样本，结合LoRA适配器微调；引入循环一致性损失和对抗训练；提出多粒度知识蒸馏策略（MKD）和序数引导蒸馏机制（OGD）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，ACDepth在夜间和雨天场景的absRel指标上分别优于md4all-DD 2.50%和2.61%。

Conclusion: ACDepth通过数据生成和域适应策略显著提升了恶劣天气下的深度估计性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous
driving and scene reconstruction. While existing methods perform well under
normal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to
challenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To
address this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method
called \textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data
generation and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step
diffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather
conditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To
ensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA
adapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally,
we integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee
the fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate
on a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages
the student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and
pretrained Depth Anything V2. This strategy guides the student model in
learning degradation-agnostic scene information from various degradation
inputs. In particular, we introduce an ordinal guidance distillation mechanism
(OGD) that encourages the network to focus on uncertain regions through
differential ranking, leading to a more precise depth estimation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our ACDepth surpasses md4all-DD by 2.50\% for night
scene and 2.61\% for rainy scene on the nuScenes dataset in terms of the absRel
metric.

Conclusion: CompBench为复杂指令引导图像编辑提供了全面的评估工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: While real-world applications increasingly demand intricate scene
manipulation, existing instruction-guided image editing benchmarks often
oversimplify task complexity and lack comprehensive, fine-grained instructions.
To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed
for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging
editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial
and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image
editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We
propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines.
Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles
editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and
objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing
requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental
limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for
the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various
domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS)
remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios
exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity
in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four
task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding,
and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop
identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a
high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one
private farmland plot dataset, containing 25,026 QA pairs and 15,556 images.
The pipeline begins with multi-source data preprocessing, including collection,
format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse
set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of
tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and
performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 18 open-source LMMs and 3
closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance
gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is
notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By
establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind
reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical
challenges for future work. Data and code can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出一种机器学习方法，用于便携式低场MRI的3D重建和分析，无需重新训练即可使用，并在多种对比度和分辨率下验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高场MRI（HF-MRI）虽然标准但普及受限，低场MRI（LF-MRI）成本低且易获取，但现有工具难以处理其低信噪比和分辨率。

Method: 使用3D U-Net训练合成LF-MRI数据预测皮质表面的有符号距离函数，并通过几何处理确保拓扑准确性。

Result: 在3mm各向同性T2加权扫描下，与HF-MRI重建结果高度一致（表面面积r=0.96，皮质分区Dice=0.98，灰质体积r=0.93），但皮质厚度相关性较低（r=0.70）。

Conclusion: 该方法为便携式LF-MRI的皮质表面分析提供了可行方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Three-dimensional reconstruction of cortical surfaces from MRI for
morphometric analysis is fundamental for understanding brain structure. While
high-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its
limited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),
particularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible
alternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized
for high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio
and resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method
for 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of
contrasts and resolutions. Our method works "out of the box" without
retraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed
distance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to
ensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI
scans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy
depends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),
orientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted
scan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived
surfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach
Dice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93. Cortical thickness remains
more challenging with correlations up to r=0.70, reflecting the difficulty of
sub-mm precision with 3mm voxels. We further validate our method on challenging
postmortem LF-MRI, demonstrating its robustness. Our method represents a step
toward enabling cortical surface analysis on portable LF-MRI. Code is available

### [266] [NOFT: Test-Time Noise Finetune via Information Bottleneck for Highly Correlated Asset Creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12235)
*Jia Li,Nan Gao,Huaibo Huang,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NOFT的模块，用于Stable Diffusion中，通过优化噪声生成高相关性和多样性的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用噪声中隐含的拓扑和纹理信息，而NOFT旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过最优传输信息瓶颈（OT-IB）微调种子噪声或反向噪声，仅需14K可训练参数和10分钟训练。

Result: NOFT在生成高保真图像变体时表现出色，尤其在拓扑和纹理对齐方面。

Conclusion: NOFT是一种高效通用的方法，适用于文本或图像引导的2D/3D AIGC资产微调。

Abstract: The diffusion model has provided a strong tool for implementing text-to-image
(T2I) and image-to-image (I2I) generation. Recently, topology and texture
control are popular explorations, e.g., ControlNet, IP-Adapter, Ctrl-X, and
DSG. These methods explicitly consider high-fidelity controllable editing based
on external signals or diffusion feature manipulations. As for diversity, they
directly choose different noise latents. However, the diffused noise is capable
of implicitly representing the topological and textural manifold of the
corresponding image. Moreover, it's an effective workbench to conduct the
trade-off between content preservation and controllable variations. Previous
T2I and I2I diffusion works do not explore the information within the
compressed contextual latent. In this paper, we first propose a plug-and-play
noise finetune NOFT module employed by Stable Diffusion to generate highly
correlated and diverse images. We fine-tune seed noise or inverse noise through
an optimal-transported (OT) information bottleneck (IB) with around only 14K
trainable parameters and 10 minutes of training. Our test-time NOFT is good at
producing high-fidelity image variations considering topology and texture
alignments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NOFT is a powerful
general reimagine approach to efficiently fine-tune the 2D/3D AIGC assets with
text or image guidance.

*Yuzhi Li,Haojun Xu,Feng Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了LLMs在视频编辑中的应用，提出L-Storyboard作为视觉信息与语言推理的桥梁，并分类视频编辑任务为收敛与发散任务，通过StoryFlow策略提升任务准确性和逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在视频编辑中的潜力，填补视觉信息与语言推理之间的空白。

Method: 引入L-Storyboard表示视频内容，分类任务为收敛与发散任务，提出StoryFlow策略优化发散任务输出。

Result: L-Storyboard提升了视觉与语言的映射，StoryFlow增强了逻辑一致性和输出稳定性。

Conclusion: LLMs在智能视频编辑中具有巨大潜力，L-Storyboard和StoryFlow为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities in video
understanding; however, their application in video editing remains largely
underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLMs in the
context of video editing. To bridge the gap between visual information and
language-based reasoning, we introduce L-Storyboard, an intermediate
representation that transforms discrete video shots into structured language
descriptions suitable for LLM processing. We categorize video editing tasks
into Convergent Tasks and Divergent Tasks, focusing on three core tasks: Shot
Attributes Classification, Next Shot Selection, and Shot Sequence Ordering. To
address the inherent instability of divergent task outputs, we propose the
StoryFlow strategy, which converts the divergent multi-path reasoning process
into a convergent selection mechanism, effectively enhancing task accuracy and
logical coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that L-Storyboard
facilitates a more robust mapping between visual information and language
descriptions, significantly improving the interpretability and privacy
protection of video editing tasks. Furthermore, StoryFlow enhances the logical
consistency and output stability in Shot Sequence Ordering, underscoring the
substantial potential of LLMs in intelligent video editing.

*Muleilan Pei,Jiayao Shan,Peiliang Li,Jieqi Shi,Jing Huo,Yang Gao,Shaojie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEPT的框架，通过结合标准清晰度（SD）地图作为先验知识，提升自动驾驶车辆在无地图驾驶环境中的场景感知和拓扑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线场景理解方法在长距离或遮挡场景中存在局限性，主要受限于车载传感器的固有约束。

Method: 提出了一种混合特征融合策略，结合SD地图与鸟瞰图（BEV）特征，并设计了一个辅助的交叉感知关键点检测任务。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的实验表明，SEPT框架显著提升了场景感知和拓扑推理性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效整合SD地图先验知识，SEPT框架为自动驾驶的无地图驾驶系统提供了更强大的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Online scene perception and topology reasoning are critical for autonomous
vehicles to understand their driving environments, particularly for mapless
driving systems that endeavor to reduce reliance on costly High-Definition (HD)
maps. However, recent advances in online scene understanding still face
limitations, especially in long-range or occluded scenarios, due to the
inherent constraints of onboard sensors. To address this challenge, we propose
a Standard-Definition (SD) Map Enhanced scene Perception and Topology reasoning
(SEPT) framework, which explores how to effectively incorporate the SD map as
prior knowledge into existing perception and reasoning pipelines. Specifically,
we introduce a novel hybrid feature fusion strategy that combines SD maps with
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, considering both rasterized and vectorized
representations, while mitigating potential misalignment between SD maps and
BEV feature spaces. Additionally, we leverage the SD map characteristics to
design an auxiliary intersection-aware keypoint detection task, which further
enhances the overall scene understanding performance. Experimental results on
the large-scale OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate that by effectively integrating
SD map priors, our framework significantly improves both scene perception and
topology reasoning, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin.

*Haozhe Xiang,Han Zhang,Yu Cheng,Xiongwen Quan,Wanwan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义引导的多模态医学图像融合方法，首次将医学先验知识融入融合过程，通过语义交互对齐模块和文本注入模块实现特征融合，并生成诊断报告评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法主要遵循计算机视觉标准，忽略了医学图像丰富的语义信息，限制了融合效果。

Method: 构建多模态医学图像-文本数据集，利用BiomedGPT生成文本描述，通过语义交互对齐模块对齐图像和文本特征，采用交叉注意力线性变换映射关系，最后嵌入文本注入模块进行特征融合。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均表现优异，能保留更多关键医学信息。

Conclusion: 提出的语义引导方法显著提升了医学图像融合的效果，为医学诊断提供了更全面的信息支持。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion plays a crucial role in medical diagnosis by
integrating complementary information from different modalities to enhance
image readability and clinical applicability. However, existing methods mainly
follow computer vision standards for feature extraction and fusion strategy
formulation, overlooking the rich semantic information inherent in medical
images. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semantic-guided medical
image fusion approach that, for the first time, incorporates medical prior
knowledge into the fusion process. Specifically, we construct a publicly
available multimodal medical image-text dataset, upon which text descriptions
generated by BiomedGPT are encoded and semantically aligned with image features
in a high-dimensional space via a semantic interaction alignment module. During
this process, a cross attention based linear transformation automatically maps
the relationship between textual and visual features to facilitate
comprehensive learning. The aligned features are then embedded into a
text-injection module for further feature-level fusion. Unlike traditional
methods, we further generate diagnostic reports from the fused images to assess
the preservation of medical information. Additionally, we design a medical
semantic loss function to enhance the retention of textual cues from the source
images. Experimental results on test datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations while preserving more critical medical information.

### [270] [LLaVA-4D: Embedding SpatioTemporal Prompt into LMMs for 4D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12253)
*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了LLaVA-4D框架，通过4D时空提示增强多模态模型对动态场景的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D多模态模型缺乏对动态对象的时空表示能力，限制了其在物理世界中的应用。

Method: 提出4D时空提示，将3D空间和1D时间编码为动态感知的4D坐标嵌入，并与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效区分背景与动态对象，提升4D场景理解能力。

Conclusion: LLaVA-4D框架通过时空提示显著提升了多模态模型对动态场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Despite achieving significant progress in 2D image understanding, large
multimodal models (LMMs) struggle in the physical world due to the lack of
spatial representation. Typically, existing 3D LMMs mainly embed 3D positions
as fixed spatial prompts within visual features to represent the scene.
However, these methods are limited to understanding the static background and
fail to capture temporally varying dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose
LLaVA-4D, a general LMM framework with a novel spatiotemporal prompt for visual
representation in 4D scene understanding. The spatiotemporal prompt is
generated by encoding 3D position and 1D time into a dynamic-aware 4D
coordinate embedding. Moreover, we demonstrate that spatial and temporal
components disentangled from visual features are more effective in
distinguishing the background from objects. This motivates embedding the 4D
spatiotemporal prompt into these features to enhance the dynamic scene
representation. By aligning visual spatiotemporal embeddings with language
embeddings, LMMs gain the ability to understand both spatial and temporal
characteristics of static background and dynamic objects in the physical world.
Additionally, we construct a 4D vision-language dataset with spatiotemporal
coordinate annotations for instruction fine-tuning LMMs. Extensive experiments
have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
different tasks in 4D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMS-VPR是一个大规模多模态数据集，专注于复杂行人环境中的视觉地点识别，填补了现有数据集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉地点识别数据集多依赖车载图像，缺乏多模态多样性且未充分代表非西方城市环境中的密集混合用途街道空间。

Method: 通过系统化的数据收集协议，采集了78,575张标注图像和2,512段视频，覆盖207个地点，并标注了GPS坐标、时间戳和文本元数据。

Result: 实验表明，利用多模态和结构线索时，传统VPR模型和图神经网络性能显著提升。

Conclusion: MMS-VPR为计算机视觉、地理空间理解和多模态推理的交叉研究提供了新资源。

Abstract: Existing visual place recognition (VPR) datasets predominantly rely on
vehicle-mounted imagery, lack multimodal diversity and underrepresent dense,
mixed-use street-level spaces, especially in non-Western urban contexts. To
address these gaps, we introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for
street-level place recognition in complex, pedestrian-only environments. The
dataset comprises 78,575 annotated images and 2,512 video clips captured across
207 locations in a ~70,800 $\mathrm{m}^2$ open-air commercial district in
Chengdu, China. Each image is labeled with precise GPS coordinates, timestamp,
and textual metadata, and covers varied lighting conditions, viewpoints, and
timeframes. MMS-VPR follows a systematic and replicable data collection
protocol with minimal device requirements, lowering the barrier for scalable
dataset creation. Importantly, the dataset forms an inherent spatial graph with
125 edges, 81 nodes, and 1 subgraph, enabling structure-aware place
recognition. We further define two application-specific subsets --
Dataset_Edges and Dataset_Points -- to support fine-grained and graph-based
evaluation tasks. Extensive benchmarks using conventional VPR models, graph
neural networks, and multimodal baselines show substantial improvements when
leveraging multimodal and structural cues. MMS-VPR facilitates future research
at the intersection of computer vision, geospatial understanding, and
multimodal reasoning. The dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频增强量化方法PMQ-VE，通过两阶段过程（BMFQ和PMTD）解决现有量化方法的性能下降问题，显著提升低比特模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer视频增强方法计算和内存需求高，量化方法直接应用会导致性能下降和细节丢失。

Method: 提出PMQ-VE框架，包括BMFQ（基于百分位初始化和迭代搜索的量化）和PMTD（渐进式多教师蒸馏）。

Result: 实验表明，PMQ-VE在多个任务和基准上优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PMQ-VE为视频增强任务提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著提升了低比特模型的性能。

Abstract: Multi-frame video enhancement tasks aim to improve the spatial and temporal
resolution and quality of video sequences by leveraging temporal information
from multiple frames, which are widely used in streaming video processing,
surveillance, and generation. Although numerous Transformer-based enhancement
methods have achieved impressive performance, their computational and memory
demands hinder deployment on edge devices. Quantization offers a practical
solution by reducing the bit-width of weights and activations to improve
efficiency. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to video
enhancement tasks often leads to significant performance degradation and loss
of fine details. This stems from two limitations: (a) inability to allocate
varying representational capacity across frames, which results in suboptimal
dynamic range adaptation; (b) over-reliance on full-precision teachers, which
limits the learning of low-bit student models. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a novel quantization method for video enhancement: Progressive
Multi-Frame Quantization for Video Enhancement (PMQ-VE). This framework
features a coarse-to-fine two-stage process: Backtracking-based Multi-Frame
Quantization (BMFQ) and Progressive Multi-Teacher Distillation (PMTD). BMFQ
utilizes a percentile-based initialization and iterative search with pruning
and backtracking for robust clipping bounds. PMTD employs a progressive
distillation strategy with both full-precision and multiple high-bit (INT)
teachers to enhance low-bit models' capacity and quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks and benchmarks.The code will
be made publicly available at: https://github.com/xiaoBIGfeng/PMQ-VE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多条件图像生成任务中如何统一处理不同模态条件的问题，同时保持空间对齐和条件区分。

Method: 提出ContextAR框架，嵌入多种条件到令牌序列，使用混合位置编码（Rotary和Learnable）和条件感知注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明ContextAR在多条件场景下具有强大的可控性和竞争力，性能接近现有自回归基线。

Conclusion: ContextAR为多条件图像生成提供了一种简洁高效的解决方案，支持任意条件组合且无需微调。

Abstract: Autoregressive transformers have recently shown impressive image generation
quality and efficiency on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models. Unlike
diffusion architectures, autoregressive models can naturally incorporate
arbitrary modalities into a single, unified token sequence--offering a concise
solution for multi-conditional image generation tasks. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{ContextAR}$, a flexible and effective framework for multi-conditional
image generation. ContextAR embeds diverse conditions (e.g., canny edges, depth
maps, poses) directly into the token sequence, preserving modality-specific
semantics. To maintain spatial alignment while enhancing discrimination among
different condition types, we introduce hybrid positional encodings that fuse
Rotary Position Embedding with Learnable Positional Embedding. We design
Conditional Context-aware Attention to reduces computational complexity while
preserving effective intra-condition perception. Without any fine-tuning,
ContextAR supports arbitrary combinations of conditions during inference time.
Experimental results demonstrate the powerful controllability and versatility
of our approach, and show that the competitive perpormance than diffusion-based
multi-conditional control approaches the existing autoregressive baseline
across diverse multi-condition driven scenarios. Project page:

TL;DR: TSSUN是一种新型网络架构，旨在统一处理遥感数据的时空谱特征和多种密集预测任务，通过标准化输入输出和局部-全局注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据的时空谱异质性导致现有深度学习模型难以统一处理，需要针对不同任务和数据配置进行昂贵调整。

Method: 提出TSSUN网络，采用时空谱统一策略标准化输入输出，并引入局部-全局窗口注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明TSSUN能适应异构输入并统一多种任务，性能达到或超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TSSUN具有强鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需任务特定修改即可应用于复杂遥感场景。

Abstract: The proliferation of diverse remote sensing data has spurred advancements in
dense prediction tasks, yet significant challenges remain in handling data
heterogeneity. Remote sensing imagery exhibits substantial variability across
temporal, spectral, and spatial (TSS) dimensions, complicating unified data
processing. Current deep learning models for dense prediction tasks, such as
semantic segmentation and change detection, are typically tailored to specific
input-output configurations. Consequently, variations in data dimensionality or
task requirements often lead to significant performance degradation or model
incompatibility, necessitating costly retraining or fine-tuning efforts for
different application scenarios. This paper introduces the
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Network (TSSUN), a novel architecture
designed for unified representation and modeling of remote sensing data across
diverse TSS characteristics and task types. TSSUN employs a
Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Unified Strategy that leverages meta-information to
decouple and standardize input representations from varied temporal, spectral,
and spatial configurations, and similarly unifies output structures for
different dense prediction tasks and class numbers. Furthermore, a Local-Global
Window Attention mechanism is proposed to efficiently capture both local
contextual details and global dependencies, enhancing the model's adaptability
and feature extraction capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets
demonstrate that a single TSSUN model effectively adapts to heterogeneous
inputs and unifies various dense prediction tasks. The proposed approach
consistently achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, highlighting
its robustness and generalizability for complex remote sensing applications
without requiring task-specific modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LMMs在OCR和推理能力上有所提升，但在文本丰富图像的复杂逻辑推理任务上表现仍未充分研究。

Method: 通过从中国国家公务员考试中筛选文本，并设计自动化流程生成多模态样本，包括多样化的背景、文本-插图布局和字体。生成的图像经过人工验证。

Result: 评估显示LMMs在多模态推理上仍落后于纯文本输入，且对视觉-文本方向敏感。

Conclusion: LogicOCR为推进多模态推理研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved
their reasoning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. However,
their performance on complex logical reasoning tasks involving text-rich images
remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark
comprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical
reasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on
domain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by
curating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and
develop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.
First, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with
diverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,
ensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images
are manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range
of representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key
insights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,
and sensitivity to visual-text orientation. Notably, LMMs still lag in
multimodal reasoning compared to text-only inputs, indicating that they have
not fully bridged visual reading with reasoning. We hope LogicOCR will serve as
a valuable resource for advancing multimodal reasoning research. The dataset is

Abstract: A novel learning-optimization-combined 4D radar odometry model, named
DNOI-4DRO, is proposed in this paper. The proposed model seamlessly integrates
traditional geometric optimization with end-to-end neural network training,
leveraging an innovative differentiable neural-optimization iteration operator.
In this framework, point-wise motion flow is first estimated using a neural
network, followed by the construction of a cost function based on the
relationship between point motion and pose in 3D space. The radar pose is then
refined using Gauss-Newton updates. Additionally, we design a dual-stream 4D
radar backbone that integrates multi-scale geometric features and
clustering-based class-aware features to enhance the representation of sparse
4D radar point clouds. Extensive experiments on the VoD and Snail-Radar
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, which outperforms
recent classical and learning-based approaches. Notably, our method even
achieves results comparable to A-LOAM with mapping optimization using LiDAR
point clouds as input. Our models and code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Frequency-Pixel Connect的领域适应框架，通过在频率空间和像素空间中引入目标增强，显著提升了模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域适应设置中，源数据和目标数据分布不同，传统的通用数据增强方法效果有限，而特定数据集的目标增强方法需要专家知识。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Frequency-Pixel Connect框架，通过混合源图像和目标图像的振幅谱和像素内容生成增强样本，增强领域多样性并保留语义结构。

Result: 该方法在四个真实世界基准测试中显著提升了跨领域连接性，优于通用方法和特定数据集的目标增强方法。

Conclusion: Frequency-Pixel Connect是一种数据集无关的方法，具有广泛的适用性，显著提升了模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness under domain adaptation settings, where
labeled source data and unlabeled target data come from different
distributions, is a key challenge in real-world applications. A common approach
to improving OOD robustness is through data augmentations. However, in
real-world scenarios, models trained with generic augmentations can only
improve marginally when generalized under distribution shifts toward unlabeled
target domains. While dataset-specific targeted augmentations can address this
issue, they typically require expert knowledge and extensive prior data
analysis to identify the nature of the datasets and domain shift. To address
these challenges, we propose Frequency-Pixel Connect, a domain-adaptation
framework that enhances OOD robustness by introducing a targeted augmentation
in both the frequency space and pixel space. Specifically, we mix the amplitude
spectrum and pixel content of a source image and a target image to generate
augmented samples that introduce domain diversity while preserving the semantic
structure of the source image. Unlike previous targeted augmentation methods
that are both dataset-specific and limited to the pixel space, Frequency-Pixel
Connect is dataset-agnostic, enabling broader and more flexible applicability
beyond natural image datasets. We further analyze the effectiveness of
Frequency-Pixel Connect by evaluating the performance of our method connecting
same-class cross-domain samples while separating different-class examples. We
demonstrate that Frequency-Pixel Connect significantly improves cross-domain
connectivity and outperforms previous generic methods on four diverse
real-world benchmarks across vision, medical, audio, and astronomical domains,
and it also outperforms other dataset-specific targeted augmentation methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion
models, has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising
serious concerns about misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement.
Although numerous Artificial Intelligence Generated Image (AIGI) detectors have
been proposed, often reporting high accuracy, their effectiveness in real-world
scenarios remains questionable. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIGIBench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the robustness and
generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors. AIGIBench
simulates real-world challenges through four core tasks: multi-source
generalization, robustness to image degradation, sensitivity to data
augmentation, and impact of test-time pre-processing. It includes 23 diverse
fake image subsets that span both advanced and widely adopted image generation
techniques, along with real-world samples collected from social media and AI
art platforms. Extensive experiments on 11 advanced detectors demonstrate that,
despite their high reported accuracy in controlled settings, these detectors

Method: 提出OWG-DS策略，包括领域距离优化（DDO）模块对齐不同领域特征，相似性类边界分离（SCBS）模块增强样本聚合，并结合对抗训练学习领域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明，该策略在跨方法和跨数据集场景中显著提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: OWG-DS策略有效解决了开放世界深度伪造检测的泛化问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence, new forgery
methods are rapidly emerging. Social platforms are flooded with vast amounts of
unlabeled synthetic data and authentic data, making it increasingly challenging
to distinguish real from fake. Due to the lack of labels, existing supervised
detection methods struggle to effectively address the detection of unknown
deepfake methods. Moreover, in open world scenarios, the amount of unlabeled
data greatly exceeds that of labeled data. Therefore, we define a new deepfake
detection generalization task which focuses on how to achieve efficient
detection of large amounts of unlabeled data based on limited labeled data to
simulate a open world scenario. To solve the above mentioned task, we propose a
novel Open-World Deepfake Detection Generalization Enhancement Training
Strategy (OWG-DS) to improve the generalization ability of existing methods.
Our approach aims to transfer deepfake detection knowledge from a small amount
of labeled source domain data to large-scale unlabeled target domain data.
Specifically, we introduce the Domain Distance Optimization (DDO) module to
align different domain features by optimizing both inter-domain and
intra-domain distances. Additionally, the Similarity-based Class Boundary
Separation (SCBS) module is used to enhance the aggregation of similar samples
to ensure clearer class boundaries, while an adversarial training mechanism is
adopted to learn the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments show that
the proposed deepfake detection generalization enhancement training strategy
excels in cross-method and cross-dataset scenarios, improving the model's
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于IMM的方法在模型组合空间和权重计算上存在局限性，无法充分处理目标的多方向运动特性和测量不确定性。

Method: DIMM通过3D解耦多层级滤波器组扩展模型组合空间，并利用基于注意力的TD3方法生成更可靠的权重矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，DIMM将现有状态估计方法的跟踪精度提高了31.61%~99.23%。

Conclusion: DIMM通过创新的模型组合和权重分配方法，有效解决了传统IMM的局限性，显著提升了3D目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: State estimation is challenging for 3D object tracking with high
maneuverability, as the target's state transition function changes rapidly,
irregularly, and is unknown to the estimator. Existing work based on
interacting multiple model (IMM) achieves more accurate estimation than
single-filter approaches through model combination, aligning appropriate models
for different motion modes of the target object over time. However, two
limitations of conventional IMM remain unsolved. First, the solution space of
the model combination is constrained as the target's diverse kinematic
properties in different directions are ignored. Second, the model combination
weights calculated by the observation likelihood are not accurate enough due to
the measurement uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DIMM,
to effectively combine estimates from different motion models in each
direction, thus increasing the 3D object tracking accuracy. First, DIMM extends
the model combination solution space of conventional IMM from a hyperplane to a
hypercube by designing a 3D-decoupled multi-hierarchy filter bank, which
describes the target's motion with various-order linear models. Second, DIMM
generates more reliable combination weight matrices through a differentiable
adaptive fusion network for importance allocation rather than solely relying on
the observation likelihood; it contains an attention-based twin delayed deep
deterministic policy gradient (TD3) method with a hierarchical reward.
Experiments demonstrate that DIMM significantly improves the tracking accuracy
of existing state estimation methods by 31.61%~99.23%.

Motivation: 现有模型在细粒度空间理解上表现不足，缺乏专用架构和训练数据。

Method: ViCA2采用双视觉编码器（SigLIP和Hiera）和令牌比率控制机制，并使用ViCA-322K数据集进行指令调优。

Conclusion: ViCA2展示了紧凑模型在空间智能上的高效性，并公开了模型、代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at general
vision-language tasks, visuospatial cognition - reasoning about spatial
layouts, relations, and dynamics - remains a significant challenge. Existing
models often lack the necessary architectural components and specialized
training data for fine-grained spatial understanding. We introduce ViCA2
(Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant 2), a novel MLLM designed to enhance spatial
reasoning. ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP
for semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio
control mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new
large-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs
for targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our
ViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly
surpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and
leading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence
with a compact model. We release ViCA2, its codebase, and the ViCA-322K dataset
to facilitate further research.

Result: 在Urban100数据集上，CDASR在×8缩放时PSNR提升0.15dB，×16时提升0.30dB，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CDASR通过语义信息融合和多组件损失函数，显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: This work introduces CLIP-aware Domain-Adaptive Super-Resolution (CDASR), a
novel framework that addresses the critical challenge of domain generalization
in single image super-resolution. By leveraging the semantic capabilities of
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), CDASR achieves unprecedented
performance across diverse domains and extreme scaling factors. The proposed
method integrates CLIP-guided feature alignment mechanism with a meta-learning
inspired few-shot adaptation strategy, enabling efficient knowledge transfer
and rapid adaptation to target domains. A custom domain-adaptive module
processes CLIP features alongside super-resolution features through a
multi-stage transformation process, including CLIP feature processing, spatial
feature generation, and feature fusion. This intricate process ensures
effective incorporation of semantic information into the super-resolution
pipeline. Additionally, CDASR employs a multi-component loss function that
combines pixel-wise reconstruction, perceptual similarity, and semantic
consistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CDASR's
superiority, particularly in challenging scenarios. On the Urban100 dataset at
$\times$8 scaling, CDASR achieves a significant PSNR gain of 0.15dB over
existing methods, with even larger improvements of up to 0.30dB observed at
$\times$16 scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EEG视觉解码方法依赖扁平神经表示、忽略大脑视觉层次结构的问题。

Method: ViEEG将视觉刺激分解为三个生物学对齐的组件（轮廓、前景对象和上下文场景），并通过三流EEG编码器和跨注意力路由逐步整合EEG特征。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG数据集上，ViEEG在受试者依赖和跨受试者设置中分别达到40.9%和22.9%的Top-1准确率，超过现有方法45%。

Conclusion: ViEEG不仅提升了性能，还为基于生物学的脑解码在AI中设定了新范式。

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a
fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial
intelligence. While EEG-based visual decoding has shown promise due to its
non-invasive, low-cost nature and millisecond-level temporal resolution,
existing methods are limited by their reliance on flat neural representations
that overlook the brain's inherent visual hierarchy. In this paper, we
introduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework
that aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes
each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour,
foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream
EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via
cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to
the association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to
align EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object
recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that
ViEEG achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 40.9% Top-1 accuracy in
subject-dependent and 22.9% Top-1 accuracy in cross-subject settings,
surpassing existing methods by over 45%. Our framework not only advances the
performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for biologically grounded
brain decoding in AI.

TL;DR: DragLoRA通过集成LoRA适配器和引入去噪分数蒸馏损失，提升了基于拖拽的扩散模型编辑的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在拖拽编辑中因特征表示能力不足和搜索空间大导致精度和效率受限。

Result: 实验表明DragLoRA显著提升了控制精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: DragLoRA为基于拖拽的图像编辑提供了更高效和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and
flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the
input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively
to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches
often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the
feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large
search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we
present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA
adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which
regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original
model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by
adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and
accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design
an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes,
prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and
computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA
are available at: https://github.com/Sylvie-X/DragLoRA.

Motivation: 动态点云（DPC）能捕捉时间变化，但缺乏质量评估研究，阻碍了相关应用的发展。

Method: 构建DPCD数据库，包含多种失真样本，通过主观实验获取MOS，并评估客观指标。

Result: 实验表明DPCQA比静态点云更具挑战性，DPCD数据库可靠且公开可用。

Conclusion: DPCD为DPCQA研究提供了基础，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Recently, the advancements in Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR) have driven
the demand for Dynamic Point Clouds (DPC). Unlike static point clouds, DPCs are
capable of capturing temporal changes within objects or scenes, offering a more
accurate simulation of the real world. While significant progress has been made
in the quality assessment research of static point cloud, little study has been
done on Dynamic Point Cloud Quality Assessment (DPCQA), which hinders the
development of quality-oriented applications, such as interframe compression
and transmission in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a
large-scale DPCQA database, named DPCD, which includes 15 reference DPCs and
525 distorted DPCs from seven types of lossy compression and noise distortion.
By rendering these samples to Processed Video Sequences (PVS), a comprehensive
subjective experiment is conducted to obtain Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from 21
viewers for analysis. The characteristic of contents, impact of various
distortions, and accuracy of MOSs are presented to validate the heterogeneity
and reliability of the proposed database. Furthermore, we evaluate the
performance of several objective metrics on DPCD. The experiment results show
that DPCQA is more challenge than that of static point cloud. The DPCD, which
serves as a catalyst for new research endeavors on DPCQA, is publicly available
at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Olivialyt/DPCD.

TL;DR: SRLoRA通过动态重组低秩子空间提升LoRA的表达能力，不增加参数但提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的低秩更新限制了表达能力和下游任务性能，需改进。

Method: SRLoRA基于重要性评分动态重组子空间，融合不重要对并重新初始化新对。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务中，SRLoRA比标准LoRA收敛更快且准确率更高。

Conclusion: SRLoRA高效通用，有望广泛应用于参数高效微调。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) method that injects two trainable low-rank matrices (A and
B) into frozen pretrained models. While efficient, LoRA constrains updates to a
fixed low-rank subspace (Delta W = BA), which can limit representational
capacity and hinder downstream performance. We introduce Subspace Recomposition
in Low-Rank Adaptation (SRLoRA) via importance-based fusion and
reinitialization, a novel approach that enhances LoRA's expressiveness without
compromising its lightweight structure. SRLoRA assigns importance scores to
each LoRA pair (a column of B and the corresponding row of A), and dynamically
recomposes the subspace during training. Less important pairs are fused into
the frozen backbone, freeing capacity to reinitialize new pairs along unused
principal directions derived from the pretrained weight's singular value
decomposition. This mechanism enables continual subspace refreshment and richer
adaptation over time, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. We
evaluate SRLoRA on both language and vision tasks, including the GLUE benchmark
and various image classification datasets. SRLoRA consistently achieves faster
convergence and improved accuracy over standard LoRA, demonstrating its
generality, efficiency, and potential for broader PEFT applications.

TL;DR: VIDEORFT通过强化微调（RFT）扩展到大语言模型（MLLMs），提升视频推理能力，解决了视频数据中复杂逻辑和时序结构的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频推理是人类智能的核心，但现有方法难以处理视频中的复杂逻辑和时序结构。

Method: 采用两阶段RFT：监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），并构建自动化的CoT数据集生成流程。

Result: 在六个视频推理基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIDEORFT为视频推理任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving
humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has
recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is
a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due
to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To
fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT
paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.
VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement
learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in
the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT
datasets. We address this by building a fully automatic CoT curation pipeline.
First, we devise a cognitioninspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning
LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal
representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a
visual-language model conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual
consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two
new datasets - VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To
further strength the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward
that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning with visual
evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware
reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that
VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖RGB输入，空间理解能力有限，且现有深度信息整合方法效果不佳。

Method: SSR框架将深度数据转化为文本理性，并通过知识蒸馏压缩为紧凑嵌入，无需重新训练即可集成到现有模型中。

Result: 实验表明SSR显著提升了深度信息利用和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: SSR为视觉语言模型提供了更接近人类的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Despite impressive advancements in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) for
multi-modal tasks, their reliance on RGB inputs limits precise spatial
understanding. Existing methods for integrating spatial cues, such as point
clouds or depth, either require specialized sensors or fail to effectively
exploit depth information for higher-order reasoning. To this end, we propose a
novel Spatial Sense and Reasoning method, dubbed SSR, a novel framework that
transforms raw depth data into structured, interpretable textual rationales.
These textual rationales serve as meaningful intermediate representations to
significantly enhance spatial reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we leverage
knowledge distillation to compress the generated rationales into compact latent
embeddings, which facilitate resource-efficient and plug-and-play integration
into existing VLMs without retraining. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
introduce a new dataset named SSR-CoT, a million-scale visual-language
reasoning dataset enriched with intermediate spatial reasoning annotations, and
present SSRBench, a comprehensive multi-task benchmark. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmarks demonstrate SSR substantially improves depth utilization
and enhances spatial reasoning, thereby advancing VLMs toward more human-like
multi-modal understanding. Our project page is at

Conclusion: S4L-FSC通过结合空间和光谱特征提取，以及异构和同构数据源的知识整合，有效解决了HSI少样本分类的挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) faces the challenge of
scarce labeled samples. Self-Supervised learning (SSL) and Few-Shot Learning
(FSL) offer promising avenues to address this issue. However, existing methods
often struggle to adapt to the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs and lack
sufficient spectral prior knowledge. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
method, Spectral-Spatial Self-Supervised Learning for Few-Shot Hyperspectral
Image Classification (S4L-FSC), aimed at improving the performance of few-shot
HSI classification. Specifically, we first leverage heterogeneous datasets to
pretrain a spatial feature extractor using a designed Rotation-Mirror
Self-Supervised Learning (RM-SSL) method, combined with FSL. This approach
enables the model to learn the spatial geometric diversity of HSIs using
rotation and mirroring labels as supervisory signals, while acquiring
transferable spatial meta-knowledge through few-shot learning. Subsequently,
homogeneous datasets are utilized to pretrain a spectral feature extractor via
a combination of FSL and Masked Reconstruction Self-Supervised Learning
(MR-SSL). The model learns to reconstruct original spectral information from
randomly masked spectral vectors, inferring spectral dependencies. In parallel,
FSL guides the model to extract pixel-level discriminative features, thereby
embedding rich spectral priors into the model. This spectral-spatial
pretraining method, along with the integration of knowledge from heterogeneous
and homogeneous sources, significantly enhances model performance. Extensive
experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of the proposed S4L-FSC approach for few-shot HSI classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如分割图和深度图）在控制扩散模型输出时过于刚性，限制了其多样性。DGM旨在通过几何先验提供更灵活的控制。

Method: DGM通过学习几何先验来捕捉主题的视觉特征和细节，避免了现有方法（如DINO或CLIP）对全局特征或语义的过度依赖。

Result: 实验表明，DGM能在扩散模型中有效平衡控制与多样性，提供灵活的生成指导。

Conclusion: DGM为扩散模型提供了一种新颖且有效的控制机制，提升了生成图像的精细控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable capabilities in
synthesizing images, but often struggle to provide fine-grained control over
the output. Existing guidance approaches, such as segmentation maps and depth
maps, introduce spatial rigidity that restricts the inherent diversity of
diffusion models. In this work, we introduce Deep Geometric Moments (DGM) as a
novel form of guidance that encapsulates the subject's visual features and
nuances through a learned geometric prior. DGMs focus specifically on the
subject itself compared to DINO or CLIP features, which suffer from
overemphasis on global image features or semantics. Unlike ResNets, which are
sensitive to pixel-wise perturbations, DGMs rely on robust geometric moments.
Our experiments demonstrate that DGM effectively balance control and diversity
in diffusion-based image generation, allowing a flexible control mechanism for
steering the diffusion process.

Motivation: 语言序列不足以描述视觉世界的时空细节，而视频序列能更好地捕捉这些细节，因此提出Video-GPT。

Method: 通过类比GPT的下一标记预测，提出下一片段扩散范式，自回归地根据历史干净片段去噪噪声片段。

Result: Video-GPT在视频预测任务中达到SOTA性能（Physics-IQ Benchmark: 34.97），并在6个主流视频任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Video-GPT在视觉世界建模和下游任务中展现了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: GPT has shown its remarkable success in natural language processing. However,
the language sequence is not sufficient to describe spatial-temporal details in
the visual world. Alternatively, the video sequence is good at capturing such
details. Motivated by this fact, we propose a concise Video-GPT in this paper
by treating video as new language for visual world modeling. By analogy to next
token prediction in GPT, we introduce a novel next clip diffusion paradigm for
pretraining Video-GPT. Different from the previous works, this distinct
paradigm allows Video-GPT to tackle both short-term generation and long-term
prediction, by autoregressively denoising the noisy clip according to the clean
clips in the history. Extensive experiments show our Video-GPT achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on video prediction, which is the key factor
towards world modeling (Physics-IQ Benchmark: Video-GPT 34.97 vs. Kling 23.64
vs. Wan 20.89). Moreover, it can be well adapted on 6 mainstream video tasks in
both video generation and understanding, showing its great generalization
capacity in downstream. The project page is at https://Video-GPT.github.io.

TL;DR: GARE框架通过引入可学习的增量Delta_ij解决文本-视频检索中的模态间隙和假阴性问题，优化梯度冲突，提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了模态间隙和批量采样中的假阴性问题，导致梯度冲突和不稳定对齐。

Method: 提出GARE框架，通过计算Delta_ij优化梯度更新方向，并引入轻量级模块和正则化组件。

Result: 在四个检索基准测试中，GARE显著提升了对齐准确性和对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GARE通过间隙感知的张力缓解机制，有效提升了文本-视频检索的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-video retrieval have been largely driven by
contrastive learning frameworks. However, existing methods overlook a key
source of optimization tension: the separation between text and video
distributions in the representation space (referred to as the modality gap),
and the prevalence of false negatives in batch sampling. These factors lead to
conflicting gradients under the InfoNCE loss, impeding stable alignment. To
mitigate this, we propose GARE, a Gap-Aware Retrieval framework that introduces
a learnable, pair-specific increment Delta_ij between text t_i and video v_j to
offload the tension from the global anchor representation. We first derive the
ideal form of Delta_ij via a coupled multivariate first-order Taylor
approximation of the InfoNCE loss under a trust-region constraint, revealing it
as a mechanism for resolving gradient conflicts by guiding updates along a
locally optimal descent direction. Due to the high cost of directly computing
Delta_ij, we introduce a lightweight neural module conditioned on the semantic
gap between each video-text pair, enabling structure-aware correction guided by
gradient supervision. To further stabilize learning and promote
interpretability, we regularize Delta using three components: a trust-region
constraint to prevent oscillation, a directional diversity term to promote
semantic coverage, and an information bottleneck to limit redundancy.
Experiments across four retrieval benchmarks show that GARE consistently
improves alignment accuracy and robustness to noisy supervision, confirming the
effectiveness of gap-aware tension mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球树种类映射对生物多样性监测和生态研究至关重要，但缺乏大规模标记数据集限制了进展。

Method: 引入GlobalGeoTree数据集，包含树木记录和遥感图像时间序列，提出GeoTreeCLIP模型，结合视觉-语言框架。

Conclusion: 公开数据集和模型旨在推动树种类分类研究，促进生物多样性创新。

Abstract: Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for
biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However,
progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive
global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3
million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and
21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired
with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables,
encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned
into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets,
primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To
demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model,
GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text
labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M.
Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in
zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing
advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we
aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster
innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型的高效适应是关键，尤其是在计算和内存受限的情况下。现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在少量参数下表现有限。

Method: WaveFT在小波域学习残差矩阵的稀疏更新，提供精细的参数量控制，适用于极低参数场景。

Result: 在个性化文本到图像生成任务中，WaveFT显著优于LoRA和其他PEFT方法，尤其在低参数量下表现更优。

Conclusion: WaveFT是一种高效的PEFT方法，适用于资源受限的场景，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with
tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in
few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT
method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual
matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering
fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter
count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme
parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the
wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that
entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on
personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline,
WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low
parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and
image diversity.

Abstract: In robotics applications, few-shot segmentation is crucial because it allows
robots to perform complex tasks with minimal training data, facilitating their
adaptation to diverse, real-world environments. However, pixel-level
annotations of even small amount of images is highly time-consuming and costly.
In this paper, we present a novel few-shot binary segmentation method based on

efficient prototype-mixture-based method that treats the background class as a
mixture of distributions. Our approach is simple, training-free, and effective,
accommodating coarse annotations with ease. Compared to existing baselines,
ProMi achieves the best results across different datasets with significant

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SSAN的端到端训练方法，用于解决细粒度视频检索中的高效计算和低存储消耗问题。通过SKE和SPD模块，SSAN在减少冗余帧特征和提高时间对齐精度方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络视频的爆炸式增长，细粒度视频检索（S-CBVR）在提高用户浏览效率和侵权检测方面变得尤为重要，但如何在高效计算和低存储消耗下实现高精度时间对齐仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出SSAN网络，包含两个新模块：SKE（自监督关键帧提取）以减少冗余帧特征，SPD（相似性模式检测）用于高精度时间对齐。SSAN通过端到端训练优化整体性能。

Result: 实验表明，SSAN在公共数据集上比现有方法具有更高的对齐精度，同时节省了存储和在线查询计算成本。

Conclusion: SSAN通过SKE和SPD模块的联合训练，显著提升了细粒度视频检索的性能，且模块可灵活应用于其他视频检索流程。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of web videos in recent years, large-scale
Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) becomes increasingly essential in video
filtering, recommendation, and copyright protection. Segment-level CBVR
(S-CBVR) locates the start and end time of similar segments in finer
granularity, which is beneficial for user browsing efficiency and infringement
detection especially in long video scenarios. The challenge of S-CBVR task is
how to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation and
low storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity and
Alignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trained
end-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in video
retrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module to
reduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection
(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frame
extraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but also
introduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms of
temporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy and
efficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly train
SSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the two
key modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other video
retrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.
Experimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higher
alignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational cost
compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-SLAM是一个基于未校准单目相机的稠密RGB SLAM系统，通过全局对齐子地图实现场景重建。相比传统方法，它优化了15自由度投影变换，提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未校准相机在子地图对齐时，传统相似变换方法不足，需考虑15自由度投影变换以实现更准确的场景重建。

Method: 通过SL(4)流形优化，估计15自由度单应变换对齐子地图，并处理闭环约束。

Result: 实验证明，VGGT-SLAM在长视频序列中提升了地图质量，解决了VGGT因GPU需求高而无法处理的问题。

Conclusion: VGGT-SLAM为未校准相机提供了一种更优的稠密SLAM解决方案。

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM, a dense RGB SLAM system constructed by incrementally
and globally aligning submaps created from the feed-forward scene
reconstruction approach VGGT using only uncalibrated monocular cameras. While
related works align submaps using similarity transforms (i.e., translation,
rotation, and scale), we show that such approaches are inadequate in the case
of uncalibrated cameras. In particular, we revisit the idea of reconstruction
ambiguity, where given a set of uncalibrated cameras with no assumption on the
camera motion or scene structure, the scene can only be reconstructed up to a
15-degrees-of-freedom projective transformation of the true geometry. This
inspires us to recover a consistent scene reconstruction across submaps by
optimizing over the SL(4) manifold, thus estimating 15-degrees-of-freedom
homography transforms between sequential submaps while accounting for potential
loop closure constraints. As verified by extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that VGGT-SLAM achieves improved map quality using long video sequences that
are infeasible for VGGT due to its high GPU requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频数据爆炸式增长，现有方法仅从视觉或文本信息的时间视角或非时间视角识别场景，忽略了互补性和外部知识的作用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合时间和非时间视角及外部知识，显著提升了视频场景识别的性能。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in real-world applications, a
comprehensive representation of videos becomes increasingly important. In this
paper, we address the problem of video scene recognition, whose goal is to
learn a high-level video representation to classify scenes in videos. Due to
the diversity and complexity of video contents in realistic scenarios, this
task remains a challenge. Most existing works identify scenes for videos only
from visual or textual information in a temporal perspective, ignoring the
valuable information hidden in single frames, while several earlier studies
only recognize scenes for separate images in a non-temporal perspective. We
argue that these two perspectives are both meaningful for this task and
complementary to each other, meanwhile, externally introduced knowledge can
also promote the comprehension of videos. We propose a novel two-stream
framework to model video representations from multiple perspectives, i.e.
temporal and non-temporal perspectives, and integrate the two perspectives in
an end-to-end manner by self-distillation. Besides, we design a
knowledge-enhanced feature fusion and label prediction method that contributes
to naturally introducing knowledge into the task of video scene recognition.
Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RLQ的新框架，用于提升衣物更换重识别（CC-ReID）在低质量图像上的性能。通过CAP和TAD两种方法，RLQ显著提高了模型在真实数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CC-ReID模型在高质量图像上表现良好，但在低质量图像（如像素化、模糊等）上表现不佳，导致特征表示被噪声干扰，难以区分不同图像。

Method: RLQ框架结合了CAP（粗粒度属性预测）和TAD（任务无关蒸馏），CAP通过预测外部属性减少噪声影响，TAD通过任务无关自监督和蒸馏缩小高质量与低质量特征之间的差距。

Result: RLQ在LaST、DeepChange等真实数据集上Top-1准确率提升了1.6%-2.9%，在PRCC上提升了5.3%-6%，在LTCC上也表现优异。

Conclusion: RLQ通过结合CAP和TAD，有效提升了CC-ReID模型在低质量图像上的鲁棒性，为真实场景应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on Clothes Changing Re-IDentification (CC-ReID) for the
real world. Existing works perform well with high-quality (HQ) images, but
struggle with low-quality (LQ) where we can have artifacts like pixelation,
out-of-focus blur, and motion blur. These artifacts introduce noise to not only
external biometric attributes (e.g. pose, body shape, etc.) but also corrupt
the model's internal feature representation. Models usually cluster LQ image
features together, making it difficult to distinguish between them, leading to
incorrect matches. We propose a novel framework Robustness against Low-Quality
(RLQ) to improve CC-ReID model on real-world data. RLQ relies on Coarse
Attributes Prediction (CAP) and Task Agnostic Distillation (TAD) operating in
alternate steps in a novel training mechanism. CAP enriches the model with
external fine-grained attributes via coarse predictions, thereby reducing the
effect of noisy inputs. On the other hand, TAD enhances the model's internal
feature representation by bridging the gap between HQ and LQ features, via an
external dataset through task-agnostic self-supervision and distillation. RLQ
outperforms the existing approaches by 1.6%-2.9% Top-1 on real-world datasets
like LaST, and DeepChange, while showing consistent improvement of 5.3%-6%
Top-1 on PRCC with competitive performance on LTCC. *The code will be made

Conclusion: e-STURT数据集将推动任务关键型事件空间感知应用的抖动感知算法发展。

Abstract: Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical
communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of
jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor
observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the
Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event
camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions.
Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera
undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high
temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is
introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter
sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of
motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric
actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly
available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical
challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a
high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event
stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware
algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.

Abstract: Understanding surveillance video content remains a critical yet underexplored
challenge in vision-language research, particularly due to its real-world
complexity, irregular event dynamics, and safety-critical implications. In this
work, we introduce SurveillanceVQA-589K, the largest open-ended video question
answering benchmark tailored to the surveillance domain. The dataset comprises
589,380 QA pairs spanning 12 cognitively diverse question types, including
temporal reasoning, causal inference, spatial understanding, and anomaly
interpretation, across both normal and abnormal video scenarios. To construct
the benchmark at scale, we design a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines
temporally aligned human-written captions with Large Vision-Language
Model-assisted QA generation using prompt-based techniques. We also propose a
multi-dimensional evaluation protocol to assess contextual, temporal, and
causal comprehension. We evaluate eight LVLMs under this framework, revealing
significant performance gaps, especially in causal and anomaly-related tasks,
underscoring the limitations of current models in real-world surveillance
contexts. Our benchmark provides a practical and comprehensive resource for
advancing video-language understanding in safety-critical applications such as
intelligent monitoring, incident analysis, and autonomous decision-making.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了热成像在导航系统中的性能，还能与传统匹配和配准流程兼容，展示了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable operations in remote and hazardous
environments, yet the visible-spectrum, camera-based navigation systems often
relied upon by UAVs struggle in low-visibility conditions. Thermal cameras,
which capture long-wave infrared radiation, are able to function effectively in
darkness and smoke, where visible-light cameras fail. This work explores
learned cross-spectral (thermal-visible) point features as a means to integrate
thermal imagery into established camera-based navigation systems. Existing
methods typically train a feature network's detection and description outputs
directly, which often focuses training on image regions where thermal and
visible-spectrum images exhibit similar appearance. Aiming to more fully
utilize the available data, we propose a method to train the feature network on
the tasks of matching and registration. We run our feature network on
thermal-visible image pairs, then feed the network response into a
differentiable registration pipeline. Losses are applied to the matching and
registration estimates of this pipeline. Our selected model, trained on the
task of matching, achieves a registration error (corner error) below 10 pixels
for more than 75% of estimates on the MultiPoint dataset. We further
demonstrate that our model can also be used with a classical pipeline for
matching and registration.

Result: 最终模型在标准视频理解任务中显著优于之前的LVLMs。

Conclusion: 时间导向的优化方案能有效提升LVLMs的视频理解能力。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed outstanding advances of large vision-language
models (LVLMs). In order to tackle video understanding, most of them depend
upon their implicit temporal understanding capacity. As such, they have not
deciphered important components that contribute to temporal understanding
ability, which might limit the potential of these LVLMs for video
understanding. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical study to demystify
crucial components that influence the temporal understanding of LVLMs. Our
empirical study reveals that significant impacts are centered around the
intermediate interface between the visual encoder and the large language model.
Building on these insights, we propose a temporal-oriented recipe that
encompasses temporal-oriented training schemes and an upscaled interface. Our
final model developed using our recipe significantly enhances previous LVLMs on
standard video understanding tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法受限于多模态训练数据不足，性能不佳。Diff-MM利用预训练模型的先验知识，解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练Stable Diffusion的UNet作为特征提取器，提出并行特征提取管道和多模态子模块调优方法。

Result: 实验表明，Diff-MM性能优于现有方法，如在TNL2K数据集上AUC比OneTracker高8.3%。

Conclusion: Diff-MM通过预训练模型的多模态理解能力，实现了统一的RGB-N/D/T/E跟踪器，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-modal object tracking integrates auxiliary modalities such as depth,
thermal infrared, event flow, and language to provide additional information
beyond RGB images, showing great potential in improving tracking stabilization
in complex scenarios. Existing methods typically start from an RGB-based
tracker and learn to understand auxiliary modalities only from training data.
Constrained by the limited multi-modal training data, the performance of these
methods is unsatisfactory. To alleviate this limitation, this work proposes a
unified multi-modal tracker Diff-MM by exploiting the multi-modal understanding
capability of the pre-trained text-to-image generation model. Diff-MM leverages
the UNet of pre-trained Stable Diffusion as a tracking feature extractor
through the proposed parallel feature extraction pipeline, which enables
pairwise image inputs for object tracking. We further introduce a multi-modal
sub-module tuning method that learns to gain complementary information between
different modalities. By harnessing the extensive prior knowledge in the
generation model, we achieve a unified tracker with uniform parameters for
RGB-N/D/T/E tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the promising
performance of our method compared with recently proposed trackers, e.g., its
AUC outperforms OneTracker by 8.3% on TNL2K.

Conclusion: GenBuster-200K和BusterX填补了AI视频检测领域的空白，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Advances in AI generative models facilitate super-realistic video synthesis,
amplifying misinformation risks via social media and eroding trust in digital
content. Several research works have explored new deepfake detection methods on
AI-generated images to alleviate these risks. However, with the fast
development of video generation models, such as Sora and WanX, there is
currently a lack of large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video datasets for
forgery detection. In addition, existing detection approaches predominantly
treat the task as binary classification, lacking explainability in model
decision-making and failing to provide actionable insights or guidance for the
public. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GenBuster-200K}, a
large-scale AI-generated video dataset featuring 200K high-resolution video
clips, diverse latest generative techniques, and real-world scenes. We further
introduce \textbf{BusterX}, a novel AI-generated video detection and
explanation framework leveraging multimodal large language model (MLLM) and
reinforcement learning for authenticity determination and explainable
rationale. To our knowledge, GenBuster-200K is the {\it \textbf{first}}
large-scale, high-quality AI-generated video dataset that incorporates the
latest generative techniques for real-world scenarios. BusterX is the {\it
\textbf{first}} framework to integrate MLLM with reinforcement learning for
explainable AI-generated video detection. Extensive comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness and
generalizability of BusterX. The code, models, and datasets will be released.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clear images from various
degradation types and levels with a unified model. Nonetheless, the significant
variations among degradation types present challenges for training a universal
model, often resulting in task interference, where the gradient update
directions of different tasks may diverge due to shared parameters. To address
this issue, motivated by the routing strategy, we propose DFPIR, a novel
all-in-one image restorer that introduces Degradation-aware Feature
Perturbations(DFP) to adjust the feature space to align with the unified
parameter space. In this paper, the feature perturbations primarily include
channel-wise perturbations and attention-wise perturbations. Specifically,
channel-wise perturbations are implemented by shuffling the channels in
high-dimensional space guided by degradation types, while attention-wise
perturbations are achieved through selective masking in the attention space. To
achieve these goals, we propose a Degradation-Guided Perturbation Block (DGPB)
to implement these two functions, positioned between the encoding and decoding
stages of the encoder-decoder architecture. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DFPIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
all-in-one image restoration tasks including image denoising, image dehazing,
image deraining, motion deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. Our codes

TL;DR: 论文提出HaarMoDic网络，利用2D Haar变换将关节投影到更高分辨率坐标，同时捕捉时空信息，显著提升3D人体姿态预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因忽略人体运动序列在时空轴上的过渡特性，难以处理复杂动作预测。

Method: 提出HaarMoDic网络，采用MR-Haar模块通过2D Haar变换将运动序列投影到混合高分辨率坐标，同时提取时空信息。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上，HaarMoDic在MPJPE指标上全面超越现有方法。

Conclusion: MR-Haar模块是关键创新，HaarMoDic通过同时利用时空信息显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: The 3D human pose is vital for modern computer vision and computer graphics,
and its prediction has drawn attention in recent years. 3D human pose
prediction aims at forecasting a human's future motion from the previous
sequence. Ignoring that the arbitrariness of human motion sequences has a firm
origin in transition in both temporal and spatial axes limits the performance
of state-of-the-art methods, leading them to struggle with making precise
predictions on complex cases, e.g., arbitrarily posing or greeting. To
alleviate this problem, a network called HaarMoDic is proposed in this paper,
which utilizes the 2D Haar transform to project joints to higher resolution
coordinates where the network can access spatial and temporal information
simultaneously. An ablation study proves that the significant contributing
module within the HaarModic Network is the Multi-Resolution Haar (MR-Haar)
block. Instead of mining in one of two axes or extracting separately, the
MR-Haar block projects whole motion sequences to a mixed-up coordinate in
higher resolution with 2D Haar Transform, allowing the network to give scope to
information from both axes in different resolutions. With the MR-Haar block,
the HaarMoDic network can make predictions referring to a broader range of
information. Experimental results demonstrate that HaarMoDic surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in every testing interval on the Human3.6M dataset in
the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) metric.

performance gain of 18.11%p on an unseen mobile OS platform. To enable
continuous dataset expansion as mobile platforms evolve, we present an
automated framework that leverages publicly available video content to create

extract reliable action sequences across diverse interface configurations. We
contribute both the MONDAY dataset and our automated collection framework to
facilitate future research in mobile OS navigation.

Motivation: 当前3D纹理生成研究不足，而几何生成已有显著进展。本文旨在系统研究纹理生成的核心问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出MVPainter，采用数据过滤和增强策略提升纹理质量，引入ControlNet优化几何-纹理对齐，并提取PBR属性生成实用渲染网格。

Result: MVPainter在纹理对齐、一致性和局部质量方面达到最佳效果，并通过人类评估验证。

Conclusion: MVPainter为3D纹理生成提供了高效解决方案，并开源了完整流程以促进研究。

Abstract: Recently, significant advances have been made in 3D object generation.
Building upon the generated geometry, current pipelines typically employ image
diffusion models to generate multi-view RGB images, followed by UV texture
reconstruction through texture baking. While 3D geometry generation has
improved significantly, supported by multiple open-source frameworks, 3D
texture generation remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate 3D texture generation through the lens of three core dimensions:
reference-texture alignment, geometry-texture consistency, and local texture
quality. To tackle these issues, we propose MVPainter, which employs data
filtering and augmentation strategies to enhance texture fidelity and detail,
and introduces ControlNet-based geometric conditioning to improve
texture-geometry alignment. Furthermore, we extract physically-based rendering
(PBR) attributes from the generated views to produce PBR meshes suitable for
real-world rendering applications. MVPainter achieves state-of-the-art results
across all three dimensions, as demonstrated by human-aligned evaluations. To
facilitate further research and reproducibility, we also release our full
pipeline as an open-source system, including data construction, model
architecture, and evaluation tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管双流架构在单图像反射去除中表现优异，但其在物理建模和网络设计中未能充分利用层间互补性，限制了图像分离质量。

Method: 1. 提出新型层间互补模型，通过低频分量与传输层交互增强互补性，高频分量提供逆调制改善细节质量；2. 设计高效的层间互补注意力机制，通过通道级重组和注意力计算优化分离效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个公开数据集上达到最优分离质量，同时显著降低计算成本和模型复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过增强层间互补性和引入注意力机制，论文方法在图像分离任务中实现了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Although dual-stream architectures have achieved remarkable success in single
image reflection removal, they fail to fully exploit inter-layer
complementarity in their physical modeling and network design, which limits the
quality of image separation. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose
two targeted improvements to enhance dual-stream architectures: First, we
introduce a novel inter-layer complementarity model where low-frequency
components extracted from the residual layer interact with the transmission
layer through dual-stream architecture to enhance inter-layer complementarity.
Meanwhile, high-frequency components from the residual layer provide inverse
modulation to both streams, improving the detail quality of the transmission
layer. Second, we propose an efficient inter-layer complementarity attention
mechanism which first cross-reorganizes dual streams at the channel level to
obtain reorganized streams with inter-layer complementary structures, then
performs attention computation on the reorganized streams to achieve better
inter-layer separation, and finally restores the original stream structure for
output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while
significantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出选择性集成攻击（SEA），通过动态选择多样化模型解决现有攻击方法在可转移性和效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法因假设所有模型在迭代中必须相同，导致可转移性和效率之间的权衡，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出SEA方法，动态选择多样化模型，固定单次迭代模型数量以保持效率，增加跨迭代模型多样性以提高可转移性。

Result: 在ImageNet实验中，SEA在相同效率下可转移性比现有方法高8.5%，且适用于商业API和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: SEA为根据资源需求自适应平衡可转移性和效率提供了可能。

Abstract: In surrogate ensemble attacks, using more surrogate models yields higher
transferability but lower resource efficiency. This practical trade-off between
transferability and efficiency has largely limited existing attacks despite
many pre-trained models are easily accessible online. In this paper, we argue
that such a trade-off is caused by an unnecessary common assumption, i.e., all
models should be identical across iterations. By lifting this assumption, we
can use as many surrogates as we want to unleash transferability without
sacrificing efficiency. Concretely, we propose Selective Ensemble Attack (SEA),
which dynamically selects diverse models (from easily accessible pre-trained
models) across iterations based on our new interpretation of decoupling
within-iteration and cross-iteration model diversity.In this way, the number of
within-iteration models is fixed for maintaining efficiency, while only
cross-iteration model diversity is increased for higher transferability.
Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of SEA in various
scenarios. For example, when dynamically selecting 4 from 20 accessible models,
SEA yields 8.5% higher transferability than existing attacks under the same
efficiency. The superiority of SEA also generalizes to real-world systems, such
as commercial vision APIs and large vision-language models. Overall, SEA opens
up the possibility of adaptively balancing transferability and efficiency
according to specific resource requirements.

Conclusion: AutoMat和STEM2Mat-Bench的成功验证了其在连接显微镜与原子模拟中的关键作用，为材料科学提供了新工具。

Abstract: Machine learning-based interatomic potentials and force fields depend
critically on accurate atomic structures, yet such data are scarce due to the
limited availability of experimentally resolved crystals. Although
atomic-resolution electron microscopy offers a potential source of structural
data, converting these images into simulation-ready formats remains
labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a bottleneck for model training and
validation. We introduce AutoMat, an end-to-end, agent-assisted pipeline that
automatically transforms scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
images into atomic crystal structures and predicts their physical properties.
AutoMat combines pattern-adaptive denoising, physics-guided template retrieval,
symmetry-aware atomic reconstruction, fast relaxation and property prediction
via MatterSim, and coordinated orchestration across all stages. We propose the
first dedicated STEM2Mat-Bench for this task and evaluate performance using
lattice RMSD, formation energy MAE, and structure-matching success rate. By
orchestrating external tool calls, AutoMat enables a text-only LLM to
outperform vision-language models in this domain, achieving closed-loop
reasoning throughout the pipeline. In large-scale experiments over 450
structure samples, AutoMat substantially outperforms existing multimodal large
language models and tools. These results validate both AutoMat and
STEM2Mat-Bench, marking a key step toward bridging microscopy and atomistic
simulation in materials science.The code and dataset are publicly available at

Abstract: Spike cameras offer unique sensing capabilities but their sparse,
asynchronous output challenges semantic understanding, especially for Spike
Video-Language Alignment (Spike-VLA) where models like CLIP underperform due to
modality mismatch. We introduce SPKLIP, the first architecture specifically for
Spike-VLA. SPKLIP employs a hierarchical spike feature extractor that
adaptively models multi-scale temporal dynamics in event streams, and uses
spike-text contrastive learning to directly align spike video with language,
enabling effective few-shot learning. A full-spiking visual encoder variant,
integrating SNN components into our pipeline, demonstrates enhanced energy
efficiency. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark spike
datasets and strong few-shot generalization on a newly contributed real-world

deployment, advancing event-based multimodal research. The source code and

Motivation: 现有模型难以预测人类场景理解时间，而视觉语言模型和语言描述比较指标的发展为建模提供了新机会。假设人类视觉系统的注视点特性与任务相关信息分布是影响理解时间的主要因素。

Method: 结合注视点视觉和VLM，生成空间分辨的场景理解图（F-SUM）及其综合评分，并与人类反应时间和眼动数据对比。

Result: F-SUM评分与人类反应时间（r=0.47）、眼动次数（r=0.51）及描述准确性（r=-0.56）显著相关，优于传统图像指标。

Conclusion: F-SUM是一种有效的图像可计算指标，证明了注视点视觉处理对场景理解难度的重要性。

Abstract: Although models exist that predict human response times (RTs) in tasks such
as target search and visual discrimination, the development of image-computable
predictors for scene understanding time remains an open challenge. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs), which can generate scene
descriptions for arbitrary images, combined with the availability of
quantitative metrics for comparing linguistic descriptions, offer a new
opportunity to model human scene understanding. We hypothesize that the primary
bottleneck in human scene understanding and the driving source of variability
in response times across scenes is the interaction between the foveated nature
of the human visual system and the spatial distribution of task-relevant visual
information within an image. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel
image-computable model that integrates foveated vision with VLMs to produce a
spatially resolved map of scene understanding as a function of fixation
location (Foveated Scene Understanding Map, or F-SUM), along with an aggregate
F-SUM score. This metric correlates with average (N=17) human RTs (r=0.47) and
number of saccades (r=0.51) required to comprehend a scene (across 277 scenes).
The F-SUM score also correlates with average (N=16) human description accuracy
(r=-0.56) in time-limited presentations. These correlations significantly
exceed those of standard image-based metrics such as clutter, visual
complexity, and scene ambiguity based on language entropy. Together, our work
introduces a new image-computable metric for predicting human response times in
scene understanding and demonstrates the importance of foveated visual
processing in shaping comprehension difficulty.

Conclusion: Safe-Sora为高效且鲁棒的视频水印保护开辟了新途径，并首次将状态空间模型应用于水印技术。

Abstract: The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for
reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity
in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely
underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora,
the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video
generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance
is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover
content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching
mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each
assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the
optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion
of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet
transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local
scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during
watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues
for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of
video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed
to our proposals. We will release our code upon publication.

Conclusion: TS-VLM为自动驾驶提供了高效、实时的多模态融合解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable potential in advancing
autonomous driving by leveraging multi-modal fusion in order to enhance scene
perception, reasoning, and decision-making. Despite their potential, existing
models suffer from computational overhead and inefficient integration of
multi-view sensor data that make them impractical for real-time deployment in
safety-critical autonomous driving applications. To address these shortcomings,
this paper is devoted to designing a lightweight VLM called TS-VLM, which
incorporates a novel Text-Guided SoftSort Pooling (TGSSP) module. By resorting
to semantics of the input queries, TGSSP ranks and fuses visual features from
multiple views, enabling dynamic and query-aware multi-view aggregation without
reliance on costly attention mechanisms. This design ensures the query-adaptive
prioritization of semantically related views, which leads to improved
contextual accuracy in multi-view reasoning for autonomous driving. Extensive
evaluations on the DriveLM benchmark demonstrate that, on the one hand, TS-VLM
outperforms state-of-the-art models with a BLEU-4 score of 56.82, METEOR of
41.91, ROUGE-L of 74.64, and CIDEr of 3.39. On the other hand, TS-VLM reduces
computational cost by up to 90%, where the smallest version contains only 20.1
million parameters, making it more practical for real-time deployment in
autonomous vehicles.

Result: 在SD1.5和SDXL上实现了一流性能，并在无真实图像情况下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SiD框架在少步生成中表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性，并提供了高效实现。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation has emerged as a promising strategy for accelerating
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by distilling a pretrained score network
into a one- or few-step generator. While existing methods have made notable
progress, they often rely on real or teacher-synthesized images to perform well
when distilling high-resolution T2I diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion
XL (SDXL), and their use of classifier-free guidance (CFG) introduces a
persistent trade-off between text-image alignment and generation diversity. We
address these challenges by optimizing Score identity Distillation (SiD) -- a
data-free, one-step distillation framework -- for few-step generation. Backed
by theoretical analysis that justifies matching a uniform mixture of outputs
from all generation steps to the data distribution, our few-step distillation
algorithm avoids step-specific networks and integrates seamlessly into existing
pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SDXL at 1024x1024
resolution. To mitigate the alignment-diversity trade-off when real text-image
pairs are available, we introduce a Diffusion GAN-based adversarial loss
applied to the uniform mixture and propose two new guidance strategies:
Zero-CFG, which disables CFG in the teacher and removes text conditioning in
the fake score network, and Anti-CFG, which applies negative CFG in the fake
score network. This flexible setup improves diversity without sacrificing
alignment. Comprehensive experiments on SD1.5 and SDXL demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in both one-step and few-step generation settings,
along with robustness to the absence of real images. Our efficient PyTorch
implementation, along with the resulting one- and few-step distilled
generators, will be released publicly as a separate branch at
https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全干预措施存在不完整概念移除、易受攻击、计算效率低或损害无关能力的问题。

Method: 采用Spectral Eraser模块，通过奇异值分解识别并隔离不良概念特征，单步更新模型。

Result: CURE在2秒内高效移除目标概念，对原始生成能力损害小，且抗攻击性强。

Conclusion: CURE为预训练模型提供了一种高效、精确的概念遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating
unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety
interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to
inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept
removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or
collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE,
a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the
weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and
highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is
the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that
identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over
token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain.
Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the
undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then
applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target
concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or
iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and
preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for
spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on
their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the
processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in
only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more
efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects,
identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation
ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

Motivation: Mamba模型在视觉任务中因无法访问全局上下文、长程遗忘和空间建模能力弱而表现不佳，需改进。

Result: 在ImageNet和COCO基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Mamba-Adaptor有效解决了Mamba模型的局限性，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent State Space Models (SSM), especially Mamba, have demonstrated
impressive performance in visual modeling and possess superior model
efficiency. However, the application of Mamba to visual tasks suffers inferior
performance due to three main constraints existing in the sequential model: 1)
Casual computing is incapable of accessing global context; 2) Long-range
forgetting when computing the current hidden states; 3) Weak spatial structural
modeling due to the transformed sequential input. To address these issues, we
investigate a simple yet powerful vision task Adaptor for Mamba models, which
consists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adaptor-S. When solving the
hidden states for SSM, we apply a lightweight prediction module Adaptor-T to
select a set of learnable locations as memory augmentations to ease long-range
forgetting issues. Moreover, we leverage Adapator-S, composed of multi-scale
dilated convolutional kernels, to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce
the image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the
context modeling in casual computing, as the output is enhanced by the
inaccessible features. We explore three usages of Mamba-Adaptor: A general
visual backbone for various vision tasks; A booster module to raise the
performance of pretrained backbones; A highly efficient fine-tuning module that
adapts the base model for transfer learning tasks. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of Mamba-Adaptor in three settings. Notably, our
Mamba-Adaptor achieves state-of the-art performance on the ImageNet and COCO

### [322] [TACOcc:Target-Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion with Volume Rendering for 3D Semantic Occupancy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12693)
*Luyao Lei,Shuo Xu,Yifan Bai,Xing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应多模态融合框架TACOcc，通过双向对称检索机制和体积渲染监督，解决了3D占用预测中的几何语义不匹配和表面细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D占用预测性能受限，主要由于固定融合策略导致的几何语义不匹配和稀疏标注引起的表面细节丢失。

Method: 提出目标尺度自适应的双向对称检索机制，优化跨模态特征对齐；改进基于3D高斯泼溅的体积渲染管道，增强表面细节重建。

Result: 在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI基准测试中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: TACOcc通过自适应融合和体积渲染监督，显著提升了3D语义占用预测的性能。

Abstract: The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by
ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion
strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The
mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and
image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To
address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric
retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance
context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and
suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism
explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy.
For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting
in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume
rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features
as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and
jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail
reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose
TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy
prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the
nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Long-RVOS的大规模基准数据集，用于长期参考视频对象分割任务，并提出了新的评估指标和基线方法ReferMo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注短视频片段，且对象在大多数帧中可见，无法满足实际场景需求。

Method: 提出Long-RVOS数据集，包含2000+长视频（平均时长超60秒），并引入新评估指标。提出基线方法ReferMo，结合运动信息和局部到全局架构。

Result: 现有方法在长视频任务中表现不佳，ReferMo在长期场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Long-RVOS和ReferMo为未来研究提供了更实际和长视频场景的基准和方向。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to identify, track and
segment the objects in a video based on language descriptions, which has
received great attention in recent years. However, existing datasets remain
focus on short video clips within several seconds, with salient objects visible
in most frames. To advance the task towards more practical scenarios, we
introduce \textbf{Long-RVOS}, a large-scale benchmark for long-term referring
video object segmentation. Long-RVOS contains 2,000+ videos of an average
duration exceeding 60 seconds, covering a variety of objects that undergo
occlusion, disappearance-reappearance and shot changing. The objects are
manually annotated with three different types of descriptions to individually
evaluate the understanding of static attributes, motion patterns and
spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, unlike previous benchmarks that rely
solely on the per-frame spatial evaluation, we introduce two new metrics to
assess the temporal and spatiotemporal consistency. We benchmark 6
state-of-the-art methods on Long-RVOS. The results show that current approaches
struggle severely with the long-video challenges. To address this, we further
propose ReferMo, a promising baseline method that integrates motion information
to expand the temporal receptive field, and employs a local-to-global
architecture to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies.
Despite simplicity, ReferMo achieves significant improvements over current
methods in long-term scenarios. We hope that Long-RVOS and our baseline can
drive future RVOS research towards tackling more realistic and long-form
videos.

Result: 实验表明，预训练LLM能准确感知空间分布信息，支持零样本执行高级任务。

Conclusion: SpatialLLM为城市智能分析提供了新视角，多领域知识、上下文长度和推理能力是关键因素。

Abstract: We propose SpatialLLM, a novel approach advancing spatial intelligence tasks
in complex urban scenes. Unlike previous methods requiring geographic analysis
tools or domain expertise, SpatialLLM is a unified language model directly
addressing various spatial intelligence tasks without any training,
fine-tuning, or expert intervention. The core of SpatialLLM lies in
constructing detailed and structured scene descriptions from raw spatial data
to prompt pre-trained LLMs for scene-based analysis. Extensive experiments show
that, with our designs, pretrained LLMs can accurately perceive spatial
distribution information and enable zero-shot execution of advanced spatial
intelligence tasks, including urban planning, ecological analysis, traffic
management, etc. We argue that multi-field knowledge, context length, and
reasoning ability are key factors influencing LLM performances in urban
analysis. We hope that SpatialLLM will provide a novel viable perspective for
urban intelligent analysis and management. The code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/SpatialLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决病理诊断中异构数据融合的高计算成本、缺失模态的鲁棒性需求以及多样化下游任务的统一模型需求。

Method: 提出ALTER框架，支持任意模态子集的预训练，学习跨模态表示。

Result: 在生存预测、癌症分型、基因突变预测和报告生成等任务中表现优异或与现有基线相当。

Conclusion: ALTER为病理诊断提供了一个灵活且强大的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have
significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and
additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although
deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key
challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated
strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2)
common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that
allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the
downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal,
cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address
these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining
framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any"
emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with
any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal
representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across
extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene
mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable
performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于实例自适应的多视角立体（IA-MVS）方法，通过缩小深度假设范围并针对每个实例进行细化，提高了深度估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分利用单个实例的深度覆盖范围小于整个场景的潜力，且初始阶段的偏差会随着进程累积，限制了深度估计精度的进一步提升。

Method: 提出IA-MVS方法，包括基于实例的深度假设范围缩小和细化，以及基于深度连续性先验的过滤机制。此外，开发了基于条件概率的置信度估计数学模型。

Result: 在DTU基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IA-MVS方法在不增加额外训练负担的情况下，显著提升了深度估计的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-view stereo (MVS) models based on progressive depth hypothesis
narrowing have made remarkable advancements. However, existing methods haven't
fully utilized the potential that the depth coverage of individual instances is
smaller than that of the entire scene, which restricts further improvements in
depth estimation precision. Moreover, inevitable deviations in the initial
stage accumulate as the process advances. In this paper, we propose
Instance-Adaptive MVS (IA-MVS). It enhances the precision of depth estimation
by narrowing the depth hypothesis range and conducting refinement on each
instance. Additionally, a filtering mechanism based on intra-instance depth
continuity priors is incorporated to boost robustness. Furthermore, recognizing
that existing confidence estimation can degrade IA-MVS performance on point
clouds. We have developed a detailed mathematical model for confidence
estimation based on conditional probability. The proposed method can be widely
applied in models based on MVSNet without imposing extra training burdens. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU benchmark. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法难以适应环境条件和传感器输入的细微变化，导致性能受限。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLM）捕捉环境上下文（如黑暗、雨天、模糊等），动态调整模态权重。

Result: 在自动驾驶和军事目标检测数据集上，VLC Fusion优于传统融合方法，检测精度更高。

Conclusion: VLC Fusion通过环境感知的动态融合策略，有效提升了多模态目标检测的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: Although fusing multiple sensor modalities can enhance object detection
performance, existing fusion approaches often overlook subtle variations in
environmental conditions and sensor inputs. As a result, they struggle to
adaptively weight each modality under such variations. To address this
challenge, we introduce Vision-Language Conditioned Fusion (VLC Fusion), a
novel fusion framework that leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to
condition the fusion process on nuanced environmental cues. By capturing
high-level environmental context such as as darkness, rain, and camera
blurring, the VLM guides the model to dynamically adjust modality weights based
on the current scene. We evaluate VLC Fusion on real-world autonomous driving
and military target detection datasets that include image, LIDAR, and mid-wave
infrared modalities. Our experiments show that VLC Fusion consistently
outperforms conventional fusion baselines, achieving improved detection
accuracy in both seen and unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: FLASH是一种专为多模态模型设计的推测解码框架，通过轻量级潜在感知令牌压缩和半自回归解码策略，显著提升了推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言和多模态模型的解码速度较慢，尤其是多模态模型中视觉输入的信息密度低且冗余，现有方法未能充分利用视觉输入的特性。

Method: FLASH采用轻量级潜在感知令牌压缩机制减少视觉令牌冗余，并利用半自回归解码策略一次生成多个令牌。

Result: 实验表明，FLASH在视频字幕生成和视觉指令调优任务中分别实现了2.68倍和2.55倍的加速。

Conclusion: FLASH通过优化视觉令牌处理和生成策略，显著提升了多模态模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large language and multimodal models (LLMs and LMMs) exhibit strong inference
capabilities but are often limited by slow decoding speeds. This challenge is
especially acute in LMMs, where visual inputs typically comprise more tokens
with lower information density than text -- an issue exacerbated by recent
trends toward finer-grained visual tokenizations to boost performance.
Speculative decoding has been effective in accelerating LLM inference by using
a smaller draft model to generate candidate tokens, which are then selectively
verified by the target model, improving speed without sacrificing output
quality. While this strategy has been extended to LMMs, existing methods
largely overlook the unique properties of visual inputs and depend solely on
text-based draft models. In this work, we propose \textbf{FLASH} (Fast
Latent-Aware Semi-Autoregressive Heuristics), a speculative decoding framework
designed specifically for LMMs, which leverages two key properties of
multimodal data to design the draft model. First, to address redundancy in
visual tokens, we propose a lightweight latent-aware token compression
mechanism. Second, recognizing that visual objects often co-occur within a
scene, we employ a semi-autoregressive decoding strategy to generate multiple
tokens per forward pass. These innovations accelerate draft decoding while
maintaining high acceptance rates, resulting in faster overall inference.
Experiments show that FLASH significantly outperforms prior speculative
decoding approaches in both unimodal and multimodal settings, achieving up to
\textbf{2.68$\times$} speed-up on video captioning and \textbf{2.55$\times$} on
visual instruction tuning tasks compared to the original LMM.

TL;DR: MVAR提出了一种新的自回归框架，通过引入尺度和空间马尔可夫假设，显著降低了条件概率建模的复杂性，减少了计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在多尺度表示生成中存在尺度和空间冗余，导致计算复杂度和内存消耗高。MVAR旨在通过马尔可夫假设减少冗余。

Method: MVAR引入尺度马尔可夫轨迹和空间马尔可夫注意力，前者仅依赖相邻尺度特征，后者限制注意力范围，降低计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，MVAR在ImageNet上性能与现有方法相当或更优，同时GPU内存占用减少3.0倍。

Conclusion: MVAR通过马尔可夫假设有效降低了自回归建模的复杂性，为高效视觉生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Essential to visual generation is efficient modeling of visual data priors.
Conventional next-token prediction methods define the process as learning the
conditional probability distribution of successive tokens. Recently, next-scale
prediction methods redefine the process to learn the distribution over
multi-scale representations, significantly reducing generation latency.
However, these methods condition each scale on all previous scales and require
each token to consider all preceding tokens, exhibiting scale and spatial
redundancy. To better model the distribution by mitigating redundancy, we
propose Markovian Visual AutoRegressive modeling (MVAR), a novel autoregressive
framework that introduces scale and spatial Markov assumptions to reduce the
complexity of conditional probability modeling. Specifically, we introduce a
scale-Markov trajectory that only takes as input the features of adjacent
preceding scale for next-scale prediction, enabling the adoption of a parallel
training strategy that significantly reduces GPU memory consumption.
Furthermore, we propose spatial-Markov attention, which restricts the attention
of each token to a localized neighborhood of size k at corresponding positions
on adjacent scales, rather than attending to every token across these scales,
for the pursuit of reduced modeling complexity. Building on these improvements,
we reduce the computational complexity of attention calculation from O(N^2) to
O(Nk), enabling training with just eight NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs and eliminating
the need for KV cache during inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
demonstrate that MVAR achieves comparable or superior performance with both
small model trained from scratch and large fine-tuned models, while reducing
the average GPU memory footprint by 3.0x.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LiDAR点云的两阶段DETR变换器模型，用于多目标跟踪，通过平滑和跟踪阶段提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云数据稀疏且不规则，传统跟踪系统依赖手工特征和运动模型，难以在拥挤或快速移动场景中保持目标一致性。

Method: 采用两阶段DETR变换器：平滑阶段优化检测，跟踪阶段通过注意力块关联目标。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现优异，在线模式aMOTA为0.722，离线模式aMOTP提升3个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在LiDAR多目标跟踪中优于基线模型和SOTA模型，尤其在在线模式下表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due
to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for
temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on
hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain
consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a
lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The
smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf
detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based
attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects
with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is
trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward
peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as
ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results
indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA
models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.722 and an aMOTP of 0.475,
while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP

Conclusion: 城市规划和机器学习模型应考虑本地人口统计和人格特质，以避免偏见和提升准确性。

Abstract: Understanding people's preferences and needs is crucial for urban planning
decisions, yet current approaches often combine them from multi-cultural and
multi-city populations, obscuring important demographic differences and risking
amplifying biases. We conducted a large-scale urban visual perception survey of
streetscapes worldwide using street view imagery, examining how demographics --
including gender, age, income, education, race and ethnicity, and, for the
first time, personality traits -- shape perceptions among 1,000 participants,
with balanced demographics, from five countries and 45 nationalities. This
dataset, introduced as Street Perception Evaluation Considering Socioeconomics
(SPECS), exhibits statistically significant differences in perception scores in
six traditionally used indicators (safe, lively, wealthy, beautiful, boring,
and depressing) and four new ones we propose (live nearby, walk, cycle, green)
among demographics and personalities. We revealed that location-based
sentiments are carried over in people's preferences when comparing urban
streetscapes with other cities. Further, we compared the perception scores
based on where participants and streetscapes are from. We found that an
off-the-shelf machine learning model trained on an existing global perception
dataset tends to overestimate positive indicators and underestimate negative
ones compared to human responses, suggesting that targeted intervention should
consider locals' perception. Our study aspires to rectify the myopic treatment
of street perception, which rarely considers demographics or personality
traits.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become increasingly versatile,
accompanied by impressive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related
capabilities. Existing OCR-related benchmarks emphasize evaluating LMMs'
abilities of relatively simple visual question answering, visual-text parsing,
etc. However, the extent to which LMMs can deal with complex logical reasoning
problems based on OCR cues is relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce
the Reasoning-OCR benchmark, which challenges LMMs to solve complex reasoning
problems based on the cues that can be extracted from rich visual-text.
Reasoning-OCR covers six visual scenarios and encompasses 150 meticulously
designed questions categorized into six reasoning challenges. Additionally,
Reasoning-OCR minimizes the impact of field-specialized knowledge. Our
evaluation offers some insights for proprietary and open-source LMMs in
different reasoning challenges, underscoring the urgent to improve the
reasoning performance. We hope Reasoning-OCR can inspire and facilitate future
research on enhancing complex reasoning ability based on OCR cues.

Result: 在YOLOv11和ResNet等模型上，PST显著提升了MS COCO和ImageNet的性能，且延迟影响极小。

Conclusion: PST是一种简单、硬件友好的增强模块，适用于检测和分类任务。

Abstract: Feature fusion is critical for high-performance vision models but often
incurs prohibitive complexity. However, prevailing attention-based fusion
methods often involve significant computational complexity and implementation
challenges, limiting their efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To
address these issues, we introduce the Pyramid Sparse Transformer (PST), a
lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates coarse-to-fine token
selection and shared attention parameters to reduce computation while
preserving spatial detail. PST can be trained using only coarse attention and
seamlessly activated at inference for further accuracy gains without
retraining. When added to state-of-the-art real-time detection models, such as
YOLOv11-N/S/M, PST yields mAP improvements of 0.9%, 0.5%, and 0.4% on MS COCO
with minimal latency impact. Likewise, embedding PST into ResNet-18/50/101 as
backbones, boosts ImageNet top-1 accuracy by 6.5%, 1.7%, and 1.0%,
respectively. These results demonstrate PST's effectiveness as a simple,
hardware-friendly enhancement for both detection and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 条件化嵌入令牌方法具有广泛适用性，能显著提升Transformer的性能。

Abstract: Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs
in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of
their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of
global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention
block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers
gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this,
we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship
between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded
tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded
tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve
the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that
this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable
and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer
architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification,
object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing,
highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Result: 实验表明，GradMix在开放集识别、闭集分类和分布外检测中优于现有方法，并提升模型鲁棒性和自监督学习性能。

Conclusion: GradMix通过优化特征学习，显著提升了模型泛化能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) is devised to address the problem of detecting
novel classes during model inference. Even in recent vision models, this
remains an open issue which is receiving increasing attention. Thereby, a
crucial challenge is to learn features that are relevant for unseen categories
from given data, for which these features might not be discriminative. To
facilitate this process and "optimize to learn" more diverse features, we
propose GradMix, a data augmentation method that dynamically leverages
gradient-based attribution maps of the model during training to mask out
already learned concepts. Thus GradMix encourages the model to learn a more
complete set of representative features from the same data source. Extensive
experiments on open set recognition, close set classification, and
out-of-distribution detection reveal that our method can often outperform the
state-of-the-art. GradMix can further increase model robustness to corruptions
as well as downstream classification performance for self-supervised learning,
indicating its benefit for model generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了特征不对齐问题，提升了实时检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Multi-head detectors typically employ a features-fused-pyramid-neck for
multi-scale detection and are widely adopted in the industry. However, this
approach faces feature misalignment when representations from different
hierarchical levels of the feature pyramid are forcibly fused point-to-point.
To address this issue, we designed an independent hierarchy pyramid (IHP)
architecture to evaluate the effectiveness of the features-unfused-pyramid-neck
for multi-head detectors. Subsequently, we introduced soft nearest neighbor
interpolation (SNI) with a weight downscaling factor to mitigate the impact of
feature fusion at different hierarchies while preserving key textures.
Furthermore, we present a features adaptive selection method for down sampling
in extended spatial windows (ESD) to retain spatial features and enhance
lightweight convolutional techniques (GSConvE). These advancements culminate in
our secondary features alignment solution (SA) for real-time detection,
achieving state-of-the-art results on Pascal VOC and MS COCO. Code will be

TL;DR: 本文研究了激活工程在减少VideoLLMs中幻觉现象的有效性，提出了一个基于时间变化的框架，显著降低了幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视频理解上取得进展，但幻觉问题仍未解决，激活工程在VideoLLMs中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 通过分析关键因素，提出时间感知的激活工程框架，自适应识别和操作幻觉敏感模块。

Result: 实验证明该方法显著减少VideoLLMs中的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 时间感知的激活工程框架有效减少VideoLLMs的幻觉，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
video understanding.However, hallucination, where the model generates plausible
yet incorrect outputs, persists as a significant and under-addressed challenge
in the video domain. Among existing solutions, activation engineering has
proven successful in mitigating hallucinations in LLMs and ImageLLMs, yet its
applicability to VideoLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we are the
first to systematically investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms
of activation engineering for mitigating hallucinations in VideoLLMs. We
initially conduct an investigation of the key factors affecting the performance
of activation engineering and find that a model's sensitivity to hallucination
depends on $\textbf{temporal variation}$ rather than task type. Moreover,
selecting appropriate internal modules and dataset for activation engineering
is critical for reducing hallucination. Guided by these findings, we propose a
temporal-aware activation engineering framework for VideoLLMs, which adaptively
identifies and manipulates hallucination-sensitive modules based on the
temporal variation characteristic, substantially mitigating hallucinations
without additional LLM fine-tuning. Experiments across multiple models and
benchmarks demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination in
VideoLLMs, thereby validating the robustness of our findings.

Conclusion: FFGAN不仅适用于复杂字符集的语言，还可用于其他文本图像任务。

Abstract: Handwritten fonts have a distinct expressive character, but they are often
difficult to read due to unclear or inconsistent handwriting. FontFusionGAN
(FFGAN) is a novel method for improving handwritten fonts by combining them
with printed fonts. Our method implements generative adversarial network (GAN)
to generate font that mix the desirable features of handwritten and printed
fonts. By training the GAN on a dataset of handwritten and printed fonts, it
can generate legible and visually appealing font images. We apply our method to
a dataset of handwritten fonts and demonstrate that it significantly enhances
the readability of the original fonts while preserving their unique aesthetic.
Our method has the potential to improve the readability of handwritten fonts,
which would be helpful for a variety of applications including document
creation, letter writing, and assisting individuals with reading and writing
difficulties. In addition to addressing the difficulties of font creation for
languages with complex character sets, our method is applicable to other
text-image-related tasks, such as font attribute control and multilingual font
style transfer.

### [339] [Accelerate TarFlow Sampling with GS-Jacobi Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12849)
*Ben Liu,Zhen Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TarFlow模型采样速度慢，通过GS-Jacobi迭代方法优化，提出CRM和IGM指标，显著提升采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决TarFlow模型因因果注意力机制导致的采样速度慢问题。

Method: 使用GS-Jacobi迭代方法，结合CRM和IGM指标优化采样过程。

Result: 在四个TarFlow模型中，采样效率提升2.51x至5.32x，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: GS-Jacobi方法有效加速TarFlow采样，保持生成图像质量。

Abstract: Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an
instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with
Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple
benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential
computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we
demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling
can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as
GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow
model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in
image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some
blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while
others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose
the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM
is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few
iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate
whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow
models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling
efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID),
achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in
Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample
quality. Code and checkpoints are accessible on

Abstract: Detecting an athlete's position on a route and identifying hold usage are
crucial in various climbing-related applications. However, no climbing dataset
with detailed hold usage annotations exists to our knowledge. To address this
issue, we introduce a dataset of 22 annotated climbing videos, providing
ground-truth labels for hold locations, usage order, and time of use.
Furthermore, we explore the application of keypoint-based 2D pose-estimation
models for detecting hold usage in sport climbing. We determine usage by
analyzing the key points of certain joints and the corresponding overlap with
climbing holds. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art models and analyze their
accuracy on our dataset, identifying and highlighting climbing-specific
challenges. Our dataset and results highlight key challenges in
climbing-specific pose estimation and establish a foundation for future
research toward AI-assisted systems for sports climbing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型只能生成特定或狭窄范围的退化效果，缺乏通用性和适应性，因此需要一种更通用的退化合成方法。

Method: 通过解压缩方法分离退化信息，并设计了两个新模块来提取和整合空间变化的退化成分。

Result: 模型在胶片颗粒模拟和盲图像恢复任务中表现出高准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该模型为图像退化合成提供了通用且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Image degradation synthesis is highly desirable in a wide variety of
applications ranging from image restoration to simulating artistic effects.
Existing models are designed to generate one specific or a narrow set of
degradations, which often require user-provided degradation parameters. As a
result, they lack the generalizability to synthesize degradations beyond their
initial design or adapt to other applications. Here we propose the first
universal degradation model that can synthesize a broad spectrum of complex and
realistic degradations containing both homogeneous (global) and inhomogeneous
(spatially varying) components. Our model automatically extracts and
disentangles homogeneous and inhomogeneous degradation features, which are
later used for degradation synthesis without user intervention. A
disentangle-by-compression method is proposed to separate degradation
information from images. Two novel modules for extracting and incorporating
inhomogeneous degradations are created to model inhomogeneous components in
complex degradations. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and adaptability in
film-grain simulation and blind image restoration tasks. The demo video, code,
and dataset of this project will be released upon publication at
github.com/yangwenbo99/content-degradation-disentanglement.

TL;DR: RobustSeg提出了一种两阶段框架，通过HPDM和RRM增强多模态鲁棒性，显著提升了多模态语义分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态语义分割在动态环境、传感器故障和噪声干扰下的性能差距问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架，包括预训练多模态教师模型和学生模型训练，结合HPDM和RRM模块。

Result: 在三个公开基准测试中，性能分别提升了2.76%、4.56%和0.98%。

Conclusion: RobustSeg通过知识蒸馏和表示正则化，显著提升了多模态语义分割的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal semantic segmentation (MMSS) faces significant challenges in
real-world scenarios due to dynamic environments, sensor failures, and noise
interference, creating a gap between theoretical models and practical
performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework called
RobustSeg, which enhances multi-modal robustness through two key components:
the Hybrid Prototype Distillation Module (HPDM) and the Representation
Regularization Module (RRM). In the first stage, RobustSeg pre-trains a
multi-modal teacher model using complete modalities. In the second stage, a
student model is trained with random modality dropout while learning from the
teacher via HPDM and RRM. HPDM transforms features into compact prototypes,
enabling cross-modal hybrid knowledge distillation and mitigating bias from
missing modalities. RRM reduces representation discrepancies between the
teacher and student by optimizing functional entropy through the log-Sobolev
inequality. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that
RobustSeg outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements
of +2.76%, +4.56%, and +0.98%, respectively. Code is available at:

Motivation: 手术复杂性要求医生和计算系统具备全面理解能力，但现有研究局限于单任务，缺乏通用性。

Method: ORQA整合多模态信号（视觉、听觉、结构化数据），并提出渐进知识蒸馏方法，生成适应不同需求的模型家族。

Result: ORQA在基准测试中表现优异，并展示零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ORQA为手术室智能提供了可扩展的统一模型，推动了多模态手术智能的发展。

Abstract: The real-world complexity of surgeries necessitates surgeons to have deep and
holistic comprehension to ensure precision, safety, and effective
interventions. Computational systems are required to have a similar level of
comprehension within the operating room. Prior works, limited to single-task
efforts like phase recognition or scene graph generation, lack scope and
generalizability. In this work, we introduce ORQA, a novel OR question
answering benchmark and foundational multimodal model to advance OR
intelligence. By unifying all four public OR datasets into a comprehensive
benchmark, we enable our approach to concurrently address a diverse range of OR
challenges. The proposed multimodal large language model fuses diverse OR
signals such as visual, auditory, and structured data, for a holistic modeling
of the OR. Finally, we propose a novel, progressive knowledge distillation
paradigm, to generate a family of models optimized for different speed and
memory requirements. We show the strong performance of ORQA on our proposed
benchmark, and its zero-shot generalization, paving the way for scalable,
unified OR modeling and significantly advancing multimodal surgical
intelligence. We will release our code and data upon acceptance.

TL;DR: EPIC是一种新型的XAI方法，结合了后处理和先验解释方法的优点，无需修改预训练模型架构即可提供基于原型的直观解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XAI方法中，后处理方法解释粗糙，而先验方法需要专用架构且适用性有限。EPIC旨在填补这一空白。

Method: EPIC在预训练模型上操作，无需架构修改，通过原型生成直观解释，结合了后处理和先验方法的优势。

Result: EPIC在CUB-200-2011、Stanford Cars和ImageNet等数据集上验证了其解释能力，提供了高质量的解释工具。

Conclusion: EPIC首次实现了后处理方法完全复制先验模型的核心解释能力，为XAI提供了灵活且易于理解的解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods generally fall into two categories. Post-hoc
approaches generate explanations for pre-trained models and are compatible with
various neural network architectures. These methods often use feature
importance visualizations, such as saliency maps, to indicate which input
regions influenced the model's prediction. Unfortunately, they typically offer
a coarse understanding of the model's decision-making process. In contrast,
ante-hoc (inherently explainable) methods rely on specially designed model
architectures trained from scratch. A notable subclass of these methods
provides explanations through prototypes, representative patches extracted from
the training data. However, prototype-based approaches have limitations: they
require dedicated architectures, involve specialized training procedures, and
perform well only on specific datasets. In this work, we propose EPIC
(Explanation of Pretrained Image Classification), a novel approach that bridges
the gap between these two paradigms. Like post-hoc methods, EPIC operates on
pre-trained models without architectural modifications. Simultaneously, it
delivers intuitive, prototype-based explanations inspired by ante-hoc
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, EPIC is the first post-hoc method
capable of fully replicating the core explanatory power of inherently
interpretable models. We evaluate EPIC on benchmark datasets commonly used in
prototype-based explanations, such as CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, alongside
large-scale datasets like ImageNet, typically employed by post-hoc methods.
EPIC uses prototypes to explain model decisions, providing a flexible and
easy-to-understand tool for creating clear, high-quality explanations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFTrack的慢快跟踪范式，结合高精度慢跟踪器和高效快跟踪器，适应不同资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的跟踪方法在低延迟和资源受限环境中表现不佳，事件相机为低延迟应用提供了新方向。

Method: 通过图表示学习从事件流中提取信息，集成到FlashAttention视觉骨干中，设计慢快跟踪器，并通过知识蒸馏优化性能。

Result: 在FE240、COESOT和EventVOT等公开基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: SFTrack在多种实际场景中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Existing tracking algorithms typically rely on low-frame-rate RGB cameras
coupled with computationally intensive deep neural network architectures to
achieve effective tracking. However, such frame-based methods inherently face
challenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in
resource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired
event cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,
offering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we
propose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different
operational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two
complementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with
sufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for
latency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework
first performs graph-based representation learning from
high-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned
graph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,
yielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves
low latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple
bounding box outputs in a single forward pass. Finally, we seamlessly combine
both trackers via supervised fine-tuning and further enhance the fast tracker's
performance through a knowledge distillation strategy. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks, including FE240, COESOT, and EventVOT, demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method across different real-world
scenarios. The source code has been released on

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验验证了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: CvHeat-DET在事件流物体检测中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Event-based Vision Sensors (EVS) have demonstrated significant advantages
over traditional RGB frame-based cameras in low-light conditions, high-speed
motion capture, and low latency. Consequently, object detection based on EVS
has attracted increasing attention from researchers. Current event stream
object detection algorithms are typically built upon Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) or Transformers, which either capture limited local features
using convolutional filters or incur high computational costs due to the
utilization of self-attention. Recently proposed vision heat conduction
backbone networks have shown a good balance between efficiency and accuracy;
however, these models are not specifically designed for event stream data. They
exhibit weak capability in modeling object contour information and fail to
exploit the benefits of multi-scale features. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a novel dynamic graph induced contour-aware heat conduction
network for event stream based object detection, termed CvHeat-DET. The
proposed model effectively leverages the clear contour information inherent in
event streams to predict the thermal diffusivity coefficients within the heat
conduction model, and integrates hierarchical structural graph features to
enhance feature learning across multiple scales. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets for event stream-based object detection fully validated the
effectiveness of the proposed model. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvDET.

Motivation: 人类活动复杂多变，但其变异性具有层次化模式的结构，可以从非脚本视频中自然涌现，并用于更好地推理活动内容。

Method: HiERO通过将视频片段与叙述描述对齐，利用层次化架构推断上下文、语义和时间推理。

Result: 在EgoMCQ、EgoNLQ等基准测试中表现优异，且在零样本任务（如EgoProceL和Ego4D Goal-Step）中显著优于全监督方法（EgoProceL上F1提升12.5%）。

Conclusion: 层次化人类活动知识对第一人称视觉中的多推理任务具有重要价值，HiERO证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Human activities are particularly complex and variable, and this makes
challenging for deep learning models to reason about them. However, we note
that such variability does have an underlying structure, composed of a
hierarchy of patterns of related actions. We argue that such structure can
emerge naturally from unscripted videos of human activities, and can be
leveraged to better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a
weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with the
corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning video clips with their
narrated descriptions, HiERO infers contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning
with an hierarchical architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched
features with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ) with
minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure learning tasks
(EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO achieves state-of-the-art
performance in all the benchmarks, and for procedure learning tasks it
outperforms fully-supervised methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL)
in zero shot. Our results prove the relevance of using knowledge of the
hierarchy of human activities for multiple reasoning tasks in egocentric
vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UnInfo的新方法，用于解决CLIP模型在传感器退化（如天气、光线或噪声）导致的分布偏移问题。通过均匀性感知信息平衡的测试时适应（TTA），UnInfo提升了模型在传感器退化情况下的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型在分布偏移（如传感器退化）时表现不佳，而收集新数据成本高昂。因此，研究无需标注数据的测试时适应方法具有重要意义。

Method: 提出UnInfo方法，包括均匀性感知置信度最大化、信息感知损失平衡和EMA教师的知识蒸馏，以解决图像嵌入的均匀性损坏问题。

Result: 实验表明，UnInfo通过保持均匀性信息，显著提升了传感器退化情况下的分类准确性。

Conclusion: UnInfo是一种有效的测试时适应方法，能够提升CLIP模型在传感器退化等分布偏移情况下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models such as contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated a remarkable generalizability, which has
enabled a wide range of applications represented by zero-shot classification.
However, vision-language models still suffer when they face datasets with large
gaps from training ones, i.e., distribution shifts. We found that CLIP is
especially vulnerable to sensor degradation, a type of realistic distribution
shift caused by sensor conditions such as weather, light, or noise. Collecting
a new dataset from a test distribution for fine-tuning highly costs since
sensor degradation occurs unexpectedly and has a range of variety. Thus, we
investigate test-time adaptation (TTA) of zero-shot classification, which
enables on-the-fly adaptation to the test distribution with unlabeled test
data. Existing TTA methods for CLIP mainly focus on modifying image and text
embeddings or predictions to address distribution shifts. Although these
methods can adapt to domain shifts, such as fine-grained labels spaces or
different renditions in input images, they fail to adapt to distribution shifts
caused by sensor degradation. We found that this is because image embeddings
are "corrupted" in terms of uniformity, a measure related to the amount of
information. To make models robust to sensor degradation, we propose a novel
method called uniformity-aware information-balanced TTA (UnInfo). To address
the corruption of image embeddings, we introduce uniformity-aware confidence
maximization, information-aware loss balancing, and knowledge distillation from
the exponential moving average (EMA) teacher. Through experiments, we
demonstrate that our UnInfo improves accuracy under sensor degradation by
retaining information in terms of uniformity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型在图像恢复任务中面临复杂退化处理能力不足、潜在空间引导不稳定以及计算开销大的问题。

Method: 提出了一种小波启发的可逆神经网络（INN），通过前向变换模拟退化，并通过逆变换恢复细节。将其集成到潜在扩散模型中，设计了两种方法：LatentINDIGO-PixelINN（像素域操作）和LatentINDIGO-LatentINN（完全在潜在空间操作）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实低质量图像上实现了最先进的性能，并能适应任意输出尺寸。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了图像恢复中的关键挑战，提升了性能并降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for
image restoration (IR) tasks due to their ability to model effectively the
distribution of natural images. While significant progress has been made, there
are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches
depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex
or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second,
many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and
finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain
for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases
computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations
through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse
transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline
through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the
pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space
to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate
latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward
model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step
preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold.
Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily
adapted to arbitrary output sizes.

Conclusion: MACB-DF方法在多模态平衡和性能提升方面表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision and deep learning have blurred the line between
deepfakes and authentic media, undermining multimedia credibility through
audio-visual forgery. Current multimodal detection methods remain limited by
unbalanced learning between modalities. To tackle this issue, we propose an
Audio-Visual Joint Learning Method (MACB-DF) to better mitigate modality
conflicts and neglect by leveraging contrastive learning to assist in
multi-level and cross-modal fusion, thereby fully balancing and exploiting
information from each modality. Additionally, we designed an
orthogonalization-multimodal pareto module that preserves unimodal information
while addressing gradient conflicts in audio-video encoders caused by differing
optimization targets of the loss functions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on mainstream deepfake datasets demonstrate consistent
performance gains of our model across key evaluation metrics, achieving an
average accuracy of 95.5% across multiple datasets. Notably, our method
exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization capabilities, with absolute
improvements of 8.0% and 7.7% in ACC scores over the previous best-performing
approach when trained on DFDC and tested on DefakeAVMiT and FakeAVCeleb
datasets.

structures. However, the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the human
skull introduces significant distortions to the propagating ultrasound
wavefront, which require time-consuming patient-specific planning and
corrections using numerical solvers for accurate targeting. To enable
data-driven approaches in this domain, we introduce TFUScapes, the first
large-scale, high-resolution dataset of tFUS simulations through anatomically
realistic human skulls derived from T1-weighted MRI images. We have developed a
scalable simulation engine pipeline using the k-Wave pseudo-spectral solver,
where each simulation returns a steady-state pressure field generated by a
focused ultrasound transducer placed at realistic scalp locations. In addition
to the dataset, we present DeepTFUS, a deep learning model that estimates
normalized pressure fields directly from input 3D CT volumes and transducer
position. The model extends a U-Net backbone with transducer-aware
conditioning, incorporating Fourier-encoded position embeddings and MLP layers
to create global transducer embeddings. These embeddings are fused with U-Net
encoder features via feature-wise modulation, dynamic convolutions, and
cross-attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
spatially weighted and gradient-sensitive loss functions, enabling it to
approximate high-fidelity wavefields. The TFUScapes dataset is publicly
released to accelerate research at the intersection of computational acoustics,
neurotechnology, and deep learning. The project page is available at

*Yimao Guo,Zuomin Qu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Anti-Inpainting的主动防御方法，通过三重机制保护图像免受未知条件下的恶意篡改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数主动防御方法仅能在已知条件下保护图像，无法应对恶意用户设计的未知篡改条件。

Method: 提出多级深度特征提取器、多尺度语义保留数据增强和基于选择的分布偏差优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，Anti-Inpainting在InpaintGuardBench和CelebA-HQ数据集上对未知条件下的篡改具有显著防御效果。

Conclusion: Anti-Inpainting方法在未知条件下具有鲁棒性和跨模型迁移能力。

Abstract: As diffusion-based malicious image manipulation becomes increasingly
prevalent, multiple proactive defense methods are developed to safeguard images
against unauthorized tampering. However, most proactive defense methods only
can safeguard images against manipulation under known conditions, and fail to
protect images from manipulations guided by tampering conditions crafted by
malicious users. To tackle this issue, we propose Anti-Inpainting, a proactive
defense method that achieves adequate protection under unknown conditions
through a triple mechanism to address this challenge. Specifically, a
multi-level deep feature extractor is presented to obtain intricate features
during the diffusion denoising process to improve protective effectiveness. We
design multi-scale semantic-preserving data augmentation to enhance the
transferability of adversarial perturbations across unknown conditions by
multi-scale transformations while preserving semantic integrity. In addition,
we propose a selection-based distribution deviation optimization strategy to
improve the protection of adversarial perturbation against manipulation under
diverse random seeds. Extensive experiments indicate the proactive defensive
performance of Anti-Inpainting against diffusion-based inpainters guided by
unknown conditions in InpaintGuardBench and CelebA-HQ. At the same time, we
also demonstrate the proposed approach's robustness under various image
purification methods and its transferability across different versions of
diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN架构在医学图像分类中难以高效捕捉多样病灶特征，且预测结果存在偏差，影响实际诊断。

Method: 采用异构金字塔感受野和专家级结构重参数化技术，模拟多专家会诊模式，优化特征提取和计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，ERoHPRF在分类性能、公平性和计算开销方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ERoHPRF为医学图像分类提供了一种高效且公平的解决方案，代码即将公开。

Abstract: Efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designs have
attracted growing research interests. However, they usually apply single
receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different
feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in
medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing
diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and
salient, which have unique roles on results, especially imbalanced medical
image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often
unfair/biased, bringing a high risk by employing them to real-world medical
diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept,
Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields
(ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and
fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by
applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bags to capture different
lesion characteristics effectively via convolution operations with multiple
heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like
structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the
two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed
through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and
generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient
CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our method maintains a
better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image
classification, fairness, and computation overhead. The codes of this paper
will be released soon.

Result: 在标准CDGE任务中验证了方法的优越泛化能力和对不同模型的适用性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过GLS视角有效解决了跨域凝视估计中的域偏移问题。

Abstract: Aiming to generalize the well-trained gaze estimation model to new target
domains, Cross-domain Gaze Estimation (CDGE) is developed for real-world
application scenarios. Existing CDGE methods typically extract the
domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift in feature space, which is
proved insufficient by Generalized Label Shift (GLS) theory. In this paper, we
introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem
by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented
and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting
strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the
continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source
distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a
probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy. Extensive
experiments on standard CDGE tasks with different backbone models validate the
superior generalization capability across domain and applicability on various
models of proposed method.

Motivation: 偏振图像包含丰富物理信息，但获取成本高且复杂。通过RGB图像估计偏振信息可以降低成本和应用复杂性。

Result: 基准确定了RGB到偏振估计的性能上限，并系统揭示了不同模型家族的优缺点。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来偏振估计方法的设计和评估提供了基础资源，并指出了潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally
absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision
applications such as reflection separation and material classification.
However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional
optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the
applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization
image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from
RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for
this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse
set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both
restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive
quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the
current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also
systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different
model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis,
and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we
provide some potential directions for future research on polarization
estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to
facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization
estimation from standard RGB inputs.

Conclusion: 3D视觉错觉显著影响机器视觉系统的深度估计，新方法通过结合常识提升了鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D visual illusion is a perceptual phenomenon where a two-dimensional plane
is manipulated to simulate three-dimensional spatial relationships, making a
flat artwork or object look three-dimensional in the human visual system. In
this paper, we reveal that the machine visual system is also seriously fooled
by 3D visual illusions, including monocular and binocular depth estimation. In
order to explore and analyze the impact of 3D visual illusion on depth
estimation, we collect a large dataset containing almost 3k scenes and 200k
images to train and evaluate SOTA monocular and binocular depth estimation
methods. We also propose a robust depth estimation framework that uses common
sense from a vision-language model to adaptively select reliable depth from
binocular disparity and monocular depth. Experiments show that SOTA monocular,
binocular, and multi-view depth estimation approaches are all fooled by various
3D visual illusions, while our method achieves SOTA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视RGB图像的辐射信息，导致在几何数据不足的区域配准效果不佳。CoFF旨在通过融合多模态数据解决这一问题。

Method: CoFF采用两阶段融合策略：1) 像素级图像特征与3D点云特征融合；2) 块级图像特征与超点特征融合，并通过粗到细匹配模块建立对应关系。

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch等数据集上，CoFF达到最先进性能，配准召回率分别为95.9%和81.6%。

Conclusion: CoFF通过有效融合多模态特征，显著提升了点云配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration has seen significant advancements with the
application of deep learning techniques. However, existing approaches often
overlook the potential of integrating radiometric information from RGB images.
This limitation reduces their effectiveness in aligning point clouds pairs,
especially in regions where geometric data alone is insufficient. When used
effectively, radiometric information can enhance the registration process by
providing context that is missing from purely geometric data. In this paper, we
propose CoFF, a novel Cross-modal Feature Fusion method that utilizes both
point cloud geometry and RGB images for pairwise point cloud registration.
Assuming that the co-registration between point clouds and RGB images is
available, CoFF explicitly addresses the challenges where geometric information
alone is unclear, such as in regions with symmetric similarity or planar
structures, through a two-stage fusion of 3D point cloud features and 2D image
features. It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns
pixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point
features, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to
improve the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine
matching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused
features. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,
3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In
addition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically
ambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves
state-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including
remarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch
and 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)

Motivation: 现有3D扩散模型在全局上下文理解上表现优异，但难以捕捉复杂形状的局部细节，且受限于遮挡和光照条件。

Method: 提出Touch2Shape模型，包括触觉嵌入模块和触觉形状融合模块，结合扩散模型与强化学习训练策略。

Result: 实验验证了重建质量，触觉探索策略进一步提升了重建性能。

Conclusion: Touch2Shape模型通过触觉信息有效解决了局部细节和遮挡问题，提升了3D形状重建的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have made breakthroughs in 3D generation tasks. Current 3D
diffusion models focus on reconstructing target shape from images or a set of
partial observations. While excelling in global context understanding, they
struggle to capture the local details of complex shapes and limited to the
occlusion and lighting conditions. To overcome these limitations, we utilize
tactile images to capture the local 3D information and propose a Touch2Shape
model, which leverages a touch-conditioned diffusion model to explore and
reconstruct the target shape from touch. For shape reconstruction, we have
developed a touch embedding module to condition the diffusion model in creating
a compact representation and a touch shape fusion module to refine the
reconstructed shape. For shape exploration, we combine the diffusion model with
reinforcement learning to train a policy. This involves using the generated
latent vector from the diffusion model to guide the touch exploration policy
training through a novel reward design. Experiments validate the reconstruction
quality thorough both qualitatively and quantitative analysis, and our touch
exploration policy further boosts reconstruction performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出InsCore，一种基于公式驱动监督学习的合成预训练数据集，用于工业应用中的实例分割，无需真实图像或人工标注，性能优于COCO、ImageNet-21k和微调SAM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业应用面临法律限制和领域差距问题，现有模型（如SAM）在工业场景中性能下降。研究目标是开发不依赖真实图像或人工标注的视觉基础模型。

Method: 提出InsCore数据集，通过公式驱动监督学习生成合成图像，模拟工业数据特性（如复杂遮挡、密集分层掩码）。

Result: 在五个工业数据集上，InsCore预训练模型性能平均提升6.2分，数据效率高（仅需10万张合成图像）。

Conclusion: InsCore是一种实用且免许可的工业视觉基础模型，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Pre-training on real-image datasets has been widely proven effective for
improving instance segmentation. However, industrial applications face two key
challenges: (1) legal and ethical restrictions, such as ImageNet's prohibition
of commercial use, and (2) limited transferability due to the domain gap
between web images and industrial imagery. Even recent vision foundation
models, including the segment anything model (SAM), show notable performance
degradation in industrial settings. These challenges raise critical questions:
Can we build a vision foundation model for industrial applications without
relying on real images or manual annotations? And can such models outperform
even fine-tuned SAM on industrial datasets? To address these questions, we
propose the Instance Core Segmentation Dataset (InsCore), a synthetic
pre-training dataset based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL).
InsCore generates fully annotated instance segmentation images that reflect key
characteristics of industrial data, including complex occlusions, dense
hierarchical masks, and diverse non-rigid shapes, distinct from typical web
imagery. Unlike previous methods, InsCore requires neither real images nor
human annotations. Experiments on five industrial datasets show that models
pre-trained with InsCore outperform those trained on COCO and ImageNet-21k, as
well as fine-tuned SAM, achieving an average improvement of 6.2 points in
instance segmentation performance. This result is achieved using only 100k
synthetic images, more than 100 times fewer than the 11 million images in SAM's
SA-1B dataset, demonstrating the data efficiency of our approach. These
findings position InsCore as a practical and license-free vision foundation
model for industrial applications.

Conclusion: ARIW-Framework为图像版权保护提供了一种高效解决方案，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of large models, copyright protection for generated image
content has become a critical security challenge. Although deep learning
watermarking techniques offer an effective solution for digital image copyright
protection, they still face limitations in terms of visual quality, robustness
and generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive
robust iterative watermarking framework (ARIW-Framework) that achieves
high-quality watermarked images while maintaining exceptional robustness and
generalization performance. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach to
optimize the encoder for generating robust residuals. The encoder incorporates
noise layers and a decoder to compute robustness weights for residuals under
various noise attacks. By employing a parallel optimization strategy, the
framework enhances robustness against multiple types of noise attacks.
Furthermore, we leverage image gradients to determine the embedding strength at
each pixel location, significantly improving the visual quality of the
watermarked images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior visual quality while exhibiting remarkable robustness and
generalization against noise attacks.

TL;DR: PI-VAD是一种基于多模态增强的弱监督视频异常检测方法，通过引入五种额外模态（姿态、深度、全景掩码、光流和语言线索）提升RGB特征的区分能力，无需在推理阶段使用多模态骨干网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB特征在区分视觉相似事件（如商店盗窃）时不够显著，限制了视频异常检测的可靠性，因此需要引入多模态信息增强鲁棒性。

Method: PI-VAD通过伪模态生成模块和跨模态诱导模块，将五种模态信息融入RGB特征，仅需在训练阶段使用多模态骨干网络。

Result: 在三个真实场景视频异常检测数据集上达到最先进精度，且推理阶段无需多模态计算开销。

Conclusion: 多模态增强显著提升了视频异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性，PI-VAD为复杂场景下的异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are
conventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to
limit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that
RGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such
as shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex
real-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by
additional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced
framework for VAD: "PI-VAD", a novel approach that augments RGB representations
by five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity
to fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity
representation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion
(optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an
axis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB. PI-VAD includes two
plug-in modules, namely Pseudo-modality Generation module and Cross Modal
Induction module, which generate modality-specific prototypical representation
and, thereby, induce multi-modal information into RGB cues. These modules
operate by performing anomaly-aware auxiliary tasks and necessitate five
modality backbones -- only during training. Notably, PI-VAD achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on three prominent VAD datasets encompassing
real-world scenarios, without requiring the computational overhead of five
modality backbones at inference.

Abstract: One of the major challenges in the field of computer vision especially for
detection, segmentation, recognition, monitoring, and automated solutions, is
the quality of images. Image degradation, often caused by factors such as rain,
fog, lighting, etc., has a negative impact on automated
decision-making.Furthermore, several image restoration solutions exist,
including restoration models for single degradation and restoration models for
multiple degradations. However, these solutions are not suitable for real-time
processing. In this study, the aim was to develop a real-time image restoration
solution for video surveillance. To achieve this, using transfer learning with
ResNet_50, we developed a model for automatically identifying the types of
degradation present in an image to reference the necessary treatment(s) for
image restoration. Our solution has the advantage of being flexible and
scalable.

Result: 不同数据集显示不同程度的位置偏差，Auto-PE能匹配或提升分类准确率。

Conclusion: 位置偏差对Vision Transformers至关重要，Auto-PE为灵活的位置嵌入提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: How discriminative position information is for image classification depends
on the data. On the one hand, the camera position is arbitrary and objects can
appear anywhere in the image, arguing for translation invariance. At the same
time, position information is key for exploiting capture/center bias, and scene
layout, e.g.: the sky is up. We show that position bias, the level to which a
dataset is more easily solved when positional information on input features is
used, plays a crucial role in the performance of Vision Transformers image
classifiers. To investigate, we propose Position-SHAP, a direct measure of
position bias by extending SHAP to work with position embeddings. We show
various levels of position bias in different datasets, and find that the
optimal choice of position embedding depends on the position bias apparent in
the dataset. We therefore propose Auto-PE, a single-parameter position
embedding extension, which allows the position embedding to modulate its norm,
enabling the unlearning of position information. Auto-PE combines with existing
PEs to match or improve accuracy on classification datasets.

Conclusion: CacheFlow在速度和精度上均优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a
significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the
predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for
3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human
motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative
models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an
unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture
into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the
flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for
conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to
samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more
lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a
typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching
results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without
loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is
completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than
previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods
on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our
method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable
prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be
publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多级循环注意力模型（MRAM），通过模拟人类视觉系统的神经层次结构，解决了现有硬注意力模型在视觉探索动态上的不足，实现了更接近人类眼动的注意力行为，并在图像分类任务中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬注意力模型（如RAM和DRAM）未能模拟人类视觉系统的层次结构，导致注意力行为过于固定或过度扫视，偏离人类眼动行为。

Method: 提出MRAM框架，通过将瞥视位置生成和任务执行解耦到两个循环层中，模拟人类视觉处理的神经层次结构。

Result: MRAM不仅实现了更接近人类眼动的注意力动态，还在标准图像分类基准上优于CNN、RAM和DRAM。

Conclusion: MRAM通过层次化建模改进了硬注意力模型的性能，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Inspired by foveal vision, hard attention models promise interpretability and
parameter economy. However, existing models like the Recurrent Model of Visual
Attention (RAM) and Deep Recurrent Attention Model (DRAM) failed to model the
hierarchy of human vision system, that compromise on the visual exploration
dynamics. As a result, they tend to produce attention that are either overly
fixational or excessively saccadic, diverging from human eye movement behavior.
In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Recurrent Attention Model (MRAM), a
novel hard attention framework that explicitly models the neural hierarchy of
human visual processing. By decoupling the function of glimpse location
generation and task execution in two recurrent layers, MRAM emergent a balanced
behavior between fixation and saccadic movement. Our results show that MRAM not
only achieves more human-like attention dynamics, but also consistently
outperforms CNN, RAM and DRAM baselines on standard image classification
benchmarks.

Abstract: We present MAGI-1, a world model that generates videos by autoregressively
predicting a sequence of video chunks, defined as fixed-length segments of
consecutive frames. Trained to denoise per-chunk noise that increases
monotonically over time, MAGI-1 enables causal temporal modeling and naturally
supports streaming generation. It achieves strong performance on image-to-video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在交通场景中缺乏高质量标注数据集，难以提取细粒度语义变化信息。

Method: 提出MFDCD框架，整合多模态频率特征，包括动态频率耦合器（DFC）和文本频率滤波器（TFF）。

Result: 在RB-SCD和三个公共基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MFDCD框架和RB-SCD数据集为道路和桥梁的语义变化检测提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of changes in roads and bridges, such as construction,
renovation, and demolition, is essential for urban planning and traffic
management. However, existing methods often struggle to extract fine-grained
semantic change information due to the lack of high-quality annotated datasets
in traffic scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Road and Bridge
Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 260 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images from diverse
cities and countries. RB-SCD captures 11 types of semantic changes across
varied road and bridge structures, enabling detailed structural and functional
analysis. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework, Multimodal
Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD), which integrates multimodal features
in the frequency domain. MFDCD includes a Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC) that
fuses hierarchical visual features with wavelet-based frequency components, and
a Textual Frequency Filter (TFF) that transforms CLIP-derived textual features
into the frequency domain and applies graph-based filtering. Experimental
results on RB-SCD and three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合3D-4D高斯泼溅方法（3D-4DGS），通过自适应地将静态区域表示为3D高斯，动态区域保留为4D高斯，显著减少了计算和内存开销，同时保持了高质量的动态场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D高斯泼溅方法在静态区域冗余分配4D高斯，导致计算和内存开销大，且可能降低图像质量。

Method: 从完全4D高斯表示开始，迭代地将时间不变的高斯转换为3D，动态高斯保留4D表示。

Result: 相比基线4D高斯泼溅方法，训练时间显著缩短，同时保持或提升了视觉质量。

Conclusion: 3D-4DGS是一种高效且高质量的动态3D场景重建方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction have shown promising
results, enabling high-fidelity 3D novel view synthesis with improved temporal
consistency. Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an
appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and
temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial
computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D
Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this
work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework
that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D
Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian
representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D,
significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational
efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation,
capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves
significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting
methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的DiTs在处理高分辨率图像时计算成本高，且存在全局信息冗余和低频惯性问题。

Method: 提出PSWA注意力机制和PCCA策略，通过窗口注意力和高频分支优化全局-局部信息交互，并构建Swin DiT模型。

Result: Swin-DiT-L在FID指标上比DiT-XL/2提升了54%，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PSWA和PCCA有效解决了DiTs的冗余问题，Swin DiT在性能和效率上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within the
domain of image generation through the incorporation of the transformer
architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic
global information modeling transformers, which face significant computational
cost when processing high-resolution images. We empirically analyze that latent
space image generation does not exhibit a strong dependence on global
information as traditionally assumed. Most of the layers in the model
demonstrate redundancy in global computation. In addition, conventional
attention mechanisms exhibit low-frequency inertia issues. To address these
issues, we propose \textbf{P}seudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{W}indow
\textbf{A}ttention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global model
redundancy. PSWA achieves intermediate global-local information interaction
through window attention, while employing a high-frequency bridging branch to
simulate shifted window operations, supplementing appropriate global and
high-frequency information. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage
Channel Allocation(PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention similarity
without additional computational cost. Building upon all of them, we propose a
series of Pseudo \textbf{S}hifted \textbf{Win}dow DiTs (\textbf{Swin DiT}),
accompanied by extensive experiments demonstrating their superior performance.
For example, our proposed Swin-DiT-L achieves a 54%$\uparrow$ FID improvement
over DiT-XL/2 while requiring less computational.

Motivation: 旨在解决传统剪枝方法需要手动定义剪枝量的问题，提高剪枝的自动化程度和实用性。

Method: 通过构建图空间编码组件的分离能力，利用互补选择和聚类算法保留多样化且互补的组件，自动确定每层最优子集。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上验证，ACSP在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: ACSP是一种高效、自动化的剪枝方法，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Automatic Complementary Separation Pruning (ACSP),
a novel and fully automated pruning method for convolutional neural networks.
ACSP integrates the strengths of both structured pruning and activation-based
pruning, enabling the efficient removal of entire components such as neurons
and channels while leveraging activations to identify and retain the most
relevant components. Our approach is designed specifically for supervised
learning tasks, where we construct a graph space that encodes the separation
capabilities of each component with respect to all class pairs. By employing
complementary selection principles and utilizing a clustering algorithm, ACSP
ensures that the selected components maintain diverse and complementary
separation capabilities, reducing redundancy and maintaining high network
performance. The method automatically determines the optimal subset of
components in each layer, utilizing a knee-finding algorithm to select the
minimal subset that preserves performance without requiring user-defined
pruning volumes. Extensive experiments on multiple architectures, including
VGG-16, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V2, across datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate that ACSP achieves competitive accuracy compared
to other methods while significantly reducing computational costs. This fully
automated approach not only enhances scalability but also makes ACSP especially
practical for real-world deployment by eliminating the need for manually
defining the pruning volume.

Motivation: 现有视觉增强技术（如随机裁剪）可能引入背景干扰或过度关注局部细节，影响全局语义理解。

Method: 采用注意力引导的裁剪和特征选择，补充全局语义信息，并引入软匹配技术优化语言模型描述的对齐。

Result: ABS在分布外泛化和零样本分类任务中达到最先进性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: ABS方法有效解决了现有技术的局限性，显著提升了零样本任务的性能。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., CLIP, demonstrate impressive
zero-shot capabilities on downstream tasks. Prior research highlights the
crucial role of visual augmentation techniques, like random cropping, in
alignment with fine-grained class descriptions generated by large language
models (LLMs), significantly enhancing zero-shot performance by incorporating
multi-view information. However, the inherent randomness of these augmentations
can inevitably introduce background artifacts and cause models to overly focus
on local details, compromising global semantic understanding. To address these
issues, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{S}election
(\textbf{ABS}) method from local details to global context, which applies
attention-guided cropping in both raw images and feature space, supplement
global semantic information through strategic feature selection. Additionally,
we introduce a soft matching technique to effectively filter LLM descriptions
for better alignment. \textbf{ABS} achieves state-of-the-art performance on
out-of-distribution generalization and zero-shot classification tasks. Notably,
\textbf{ABS} is training-free and even rivals few-shot and test-time adaptation
methods. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能快速从单个样本中泛化手写风格，而机器在低数据环境下难以捕捉细微的空间和风格线索，WriteViT旨在填补这一差距。

Method: WriteViT结合了ViT-based Writer Identifier提取风格嵌入、多尺度生成器（Transformer编码器-解码器块+条件位置编码）和轻量级ViT-based识别器。

Result: 在越南语和英语数据集上，WriteViT生成了高质量且风格一致的手写文本，同时在低资源场景下保持了强识别性能。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的设计在多语言手写生成和高效风格适应方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Humans can quickly generalize handwriting styles from a single example by
intuitively separating content from style. Machines, however, struggle with
this task, especially in low-data settings, often missing subtle spatial and
stylistic cues. Motivated by this gap, we introduce WriteViT, a one-shot
handwritten text synthesis framework that incorporates Vision Transformers
(ViT), a family of models that have shown strong performance across various
computer vision tasks. WriteViT integrates a ViT-based Writer Identifier for
extracting style embeddings, a multi-scale generator built with Transformer
encoder-decoder blocks enhanced by conditional positional encoding (CPE), and a
lightweight ViT-based recognizer. While previous methods typically rely on CNNs
or CRNNs, our design leverages transformers in key components to better capture
both fine-grained stroke details and higher-level style information. Although
handwritten text synthesis has been widely explored, its application to
Vietnamese -- a language rich in diacritics and complex typography -- remains
limited. Experiments on Vietnamese and English datasets demonstrate that
WriteViT produces high-quality, style-consistent handwriting while maintaining
strong recognition performance in low-resource scenarios. These results
highlight the promise of transformer-based designs for multilingual handwriting
generation and efficient style adaptation.

Result: 在合成和真实SP-LiDAR数据上，SPLiDER表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 联合估计深度和反射率在动态场景中更高效有效。

Abstract: Single-Photon Light Detection and Ranging (SP-LiDAR is emerging as a leading
technology for long-range, high-precision 3D vision tasks. In SP-LiDAR,
timestamps encode two complementary pieces of information: pulse travel time
(depth) and the number of photons reflected by the object (reflectivity).
Existing SP-LiDAR reconstruction methods typically recover depth and
reflectivity separately or sequentially use one modality to estimate the other.
Moreover, the conventional 3D histogram construction is effective mainly for
slow-moving or stationary scenes. In dynamic scenes, however, it is more
efficient and effective to directly process the timestamps. In this paper, we
introduce an estimation method to simultaneously recover both depth and
reflectivity in fast-moving scenes. We offer two contributions: (1) A
theoretical analysis demonstrating the mutual correlation between depth and
reflectivity and the conditions under which joint estimation becomes
beneficial. (2) A novel reconstruction method, "SPLiDER", which exploits the
shared information to enhance signal recovery. On both synthetic and real
SP-LiDAR data, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior
joint reconstruction quality.

fine-tuning for multimodal reasoning. Our exploration mainly comprises of
following three perspective: First, through offline data curation, we analyze
the U-shaped difficulty distribution of two given datasets using the base model
by multi-round sampling, and then filter out prompts that are either too simple
or extremely difficult to provide meaningful gradients and perform subsequent
two-stage training. Second, we implement an online advantage differentiation,
computing group-wise empirical accuracy as a difficulty proxy to adaptively
reweight advantages estimation, providing stronger learning signals for more
challenging problems. Finally, we introduce difficulty hints as explicit
prompts for more complex samples in the second training stage, encouraging the
model to calibrate its reasoning depth and perform reflective validation
checks. Our comprehensive approach demonstrates significant performances across
various multi-modal mathematical reasoning benchmarks with only 2K+0.6K

Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏深度信息，依赖平坦地面假设，限制了BEV特征的准确性。

Result: 在Apollo和OpenLane数据集上表现与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 深度感知BEV特征变换有效提升了3D车道检测的准确性。

Abstract: 3D Lane detection plays an important role in autonomous driving. Recent
advances primarily build Birds-Eye-View (BEV) feature from front-view (FV)
images to perceive 3D information of Lane more effectively. However,
constructing accurate BEV information from FV image is limited due to the
lacking of depth information, causing previous works often rely heavily on the
assumption of a flat ground plane. Leveraging monocular depth estimation to
assist in constructing BEV features is less constrained, but existing methods
struggle to effectively integrate the two tasks. To address the above issue, in
this paper, an accurate 3D lane detection method based on depth-aware BEV
feature transtormation is proposed. In detail, an effective feature extraction
module is designed, in which a Depth Net is integrated to obtain the vital
depth information for 3D perception, thereby simplifying the complexity of view
transformation. Subquently a feature reduce module is proposed to reduce height
dimension of FV features and depth features, thereby enables effective fusion
of crucial FV features and depth features. Then a fusion module is designed to
build BEV feature from prime FV feature and depth information. The proposed
method performs comparably with state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
Apollo, realistic OpenLane datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景中，快速的自运动和物体运动会导致RGB图像和LiDAR测量质量下降，传统RGB-D传感器难以精确对齐和捕获可靠深度。事件相机的高时间分辨率为此提供了补充信息。

Method: 提出EventDC框架，包含事件调制对齐（EMA）和局部深度过滤（LDF）模块，通过学习事件流驱动的卷积偏移和权重，优化RGB-D特征对齐和深度估计。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，EventDC在动态场景中的深度补全效果优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EventDC通过事件相机和自适应学习模块，显著提升了动态场景中的深度补全性能，并建立了首个事件驱动的深度补全基准。

Abstract: Depth completion in dynamic scenes poses significant challenges due to rapid
ego-motion and object motion, which can severely degrade the quality of input
modalities such as RGB images and LiDAR measurements. Conventional RGB-D
sensors often struggle to align precisely and capture reliable depth under such
conditions. In contrast, event cameras with their high temporal resolution and
sensitivity to motion at the pixel level provide complementary cues that are
%particularly beneficial in dynamic environments.To this end, we propose
EventDC, the first event-driven depth completion framework. It consists of two
key components: Event-Modulated Alignment (EMA) and Local Depth Filtering
(LDF). Both modules adaptively learn the two fundamental components of
convolution operations: offsets and weights conditioned on motion-sensitive
event streams. In the encoder, EMA leverages events to modulate the sampling
positions of RGB-D features to achieve pixel redistribution for improved
alignment and fusion. In the decoder, LDF refines depth estimations around
moving objects by learning motion-aware masks from events. Additionally,
EventDC incorporates two loss terms to further benefit global alignment and
enhance local depth recovery. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for
event-based depth completion comprising one real-world and two synthetic
datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments on this benchmark
demonstrate the superiority of our EventDC.

Conclusion: 支持计算机视觉模型用于评估GT概念的学习解释，同时指出多模态整合可能损害几何敏感性。

Abstract: With the rapid improvement of machine learning (ML) models, cognitive
scientists are increasingly asking about their alignment with how humans think.
Here, we ask this question for computer vision models and human sensitivity to
geometric and topological (GT) concepts. Under the core knowledge account,
these concepts are innate and supported by dedicated neural circuitry. In this
work, we investigate an alternative explanation, that GT concepts are learned
``for free'' through everyday interaction with the environment. We do so using
computer visions models, which are trained on large image datasets. We build on
prior studies to investigate the overall performance and human alignment of
three classes of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
transformer-based models, and vision-language models -- on an odd-one-out task
testing 43 GT concepts spanning seven classes. Transformer-based models achieve
the highest overall accuracy, surpassing that of young children. They also show
strong alignment with children's performance, finding the same classes of
concepts easy vs. difficult. By contrast, vision-language models underperform
their vision-only counterparts and deviate further from human profiles,
indicating that na\"ive multimodality might compromise abstract geometric
sensitivity. These findings support the use of computer vision models to
evaluate the sufficiency of the learning account for explaining human
sensitivity to GT concepts, while also suggesting that integrating linguistic
and visual representations might have unpredicted deleterious consequences.

datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original
datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various
training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly
advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation
during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger
datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy
still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our
empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods
often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the
images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior
results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of
DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along
with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance
improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual
information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more
comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GCRDP的新方法，用于解决少样本跨模态检索中的多峰分布问题，通过高斯混合模型和多正样本对比学习机制提升检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态检索方法假设训练和测试数据共享相同的类别分布，而少样本检索涉及稀疏表示的数据，现有方法难以建模多峰分布，导致潜在语义空间中的偏差。

Method: 提出GCRDP方法，利用高斯混合模型捕捉数据多峰分布，结合多正样本对比学习机制和新的跨模态语义对齐策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，GCRDP优于六种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GCRDP有效解决了少样本跨模态检索中的偏差问题，显著提升了检索准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot cross-modal retrieval focuses on learning cross-modal
representations with limited training samples, enabling the model to handle
unseen classes during inference. Unlike traditional cross-modal retrieval
tasks, which assume that both training and testing data share the same class
distribution, few-shot retrieval involves data with sparse representations
across modalities. Existing methods often fail to adequately model the
multi-peak distribution of few-shot cross-modal data, resulting in two main
biases in the latent semantic space: intra-modal bias, where sparse samples
fail to capture intra-class diversity, and inter-modal bias, where
misalignments between image and text distributions exacerbate the semantic gap.
These biases hinder retrieval accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, GCRDP, for few-shot cross-modal retrieval. This approach
effectively captures the complex multi-peak distribution of data using a
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and incorporates a multi-positive sample
contrastive learning mechanism for comprehensive feature modeling.
Additionally, we introduce a new strategy for cross-modal semantic alignment,
which constrains the relative distances between image and text feature
distributions, thereby improving the accuracy of cross-modal representations.
We validate our approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets, demonstrating superior performance over six state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件光流数据集多样性不足且难以收集，尤其是水下应用缺乏标注数据集，阻碍了事件视觉与自主水下机器人的结合。

Method: 基于Stonefish模拟器创建合成数据集eStonefish-scenes，提供数据生成管道模拟动态水下场景，并开发工具库eWiz处理事件数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据集和工具库为水下事件视觉研究提供了可扩展的解决方案，填补了现实与模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The combined use of event-based vision and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) is
expected to significantly impact robotics, particularly in tasks like visual
odometry and obstacle avoidance. While existing real-world event-based datasets
for optical flow prediction, typically captured with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), offer valuable insights, they are limited in diversity, scalability,
and are challenging to collect. Moreover, there is a notable lack of labelled
datasets for underwater applications, which hinders the integration of
event-based vision with Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To address this,
synthetic datasets could provide a scalable solution while bridging the gap
between simulation and reality. In this work, we introduce eStonefish-scenes, a
synthetic event-based optical flow dataset based on the Stonefish simulator.
Along with the dataset, we present a data generation pipeline that enables the
creation of customizable underwater environments. This pipeline allows for
simulating dynamic scenarios, such as biologically inspired schools of fish
exhibiting realistic motion patterns, including obstacle avoidance and reactive
navigation around corals. Additionally, we introduce a scene generator that can
build realistic reef seabeds by randomly distributing coral across the terrain.
To streamline data accessibility, we present eWiz, a comprehensive library
designed for processing event-based data, offering tools for data loading,
augmentation, visualization, encoding, and training data generation, along with
loss functions and performance metrics.

Abstract: Efficient compression of low-bit-rate point clouds is critical for
bandwidth-constrained applications. However, existing techniques mainly focus
on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This
paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture
for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder
produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a
learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates
while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved
rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art
approaches. We publicly released the code at

Abstract: Anatomical trees are critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning,
yet their complex and diverse geometry make accurate representation a
significant challenge. Motivated by the latest advances in large language
models, we introduce an autoregressive method for synthesizing anatomical
trees. Our approach first embeds vessel structures into a learned discrete
vocabulary using a VQ-VAE architecture, then models their generation
autoregressively with a GPT-2 model. This method effectively captures intricate
geometries and branching patterns, enabling realistic vascular tree synthesis.
Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveal that our
technique achieves high-fidelity tree reconstruction with compact discrete
representations. Moreover, our B-spline representation of vessel cross-sections
preserves critical morphological details that are often overlooked in previous'
methods parameterizations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
to generate blood vessels in an autoregressive manner. Code, data, and trained
models will be made available.

Method: 提出UniAttackData+数据集和HiPTune框架，通过视觉提示树和动态提示集成模块实现多语义空间分类。

Result: 在12个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，为UAD领域提供了新思路。

Conclusion: UniAttackData+和HiPTune为统一检测物理和数字伪造攻击提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Presentation Attack Detection and Face Forgery Detection are designed to
protect face data from physical media-based Presentation Attacks and digital
editing-based DeepFakes respectively. But separate training of these two models
makes them vulnerable to unknown attacks and burdens deployment environments.
The lack of a Unified Face Attack Detection model to handle both types of
attacks is mainly due to two factors. First, there's a lack of adequate
benchmarks for models to explore. Existing UAD datasets have limited attack
types and samples, restricting the model's ability to address advanced threats.
To address this, we propose UniAttackDataPlus (UniAttackData+), the most
extensive and sophisticated collection of forgery techniques to date. It
includes 2,875 identities and their 54 kinds of falsified samples, totaling
697,347 videos. Second, there's a lack of a reliable classification criterion.
Current methods try to find an arbitrary criterion within the same semantic
space, which fails when encountering diverse attacks. So, we present a novel
Visual-Language Model-based Hierarchical Prompt Tuning Framework (HiPTune) that
adaptively explores multiple classification criteria from different semantic
spaces. We build a Visual Prompt Tree to explore various classification rules
hierarchically. Then, by adaptively pruning the prompts, the model can select
the most suitable prompts to guide the encoder to extract discriminative
features at different levels in a coarse-to-fine way. Finally, to help the
model understand the classification criteria in visual space, we propose a
Dynamically Prompt Integration module to project the visual prompts to the text
encoder for more accurate semantics. Experiments on 12 datasets have shown the
potential to inspire further innovations in the UAD field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要训练，而RoPECraft旨在通过直接修改RoPE实现高效的运动迁移。

Method: 提取参考视频的光流，利用运动偏移扭曲RoPE的复数张量，并通过流匹配目标优化轨迹对齐。

Result: 实验表明，RoPECraft在质量和数量上均优于近期方法。

Conclusion: RoPECraft提供了一种高效且无需训练的视频运动迁移解决方案。

Abstract: We propose RoPECraft, a training-free video motion transfer method for
diffusion transformers that operates solely by modifying their rotary
positional embeddings (RoPE). We first extract dense optical flow from a
reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the
complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the
generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during
denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target
velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the
text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization
term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform,
projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency
artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all
recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>

Motivation: 解决视频扩散变换器中3D注意力计算的高成本问题，利用注意力集中在少数位置的特点。

Method: VSA采用轻量级粗阶段和细阶段处理令牌，仅对关键令牌进行注意力计算，确保硬件效率。

Result: VSA减少训练FLOPS 2.53倍，注意力时间加快6倍，生成时间从31秒降至18秒，性能无损失。

Conclusion: VSA证明可训练稀疏注意力是高效替代方案，支持视频扩散模型的进一步扩展。

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D
attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small
subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable,
hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both}
training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into
tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes
token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing
layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel
that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of
FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and
scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA
reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in
diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention
time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with
comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a
practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling
of video diffusion models.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective
computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data.
Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement
of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs)
that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often
struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and
reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face
significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their
inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs. To
address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that
provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal
reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark,
FEABench. Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to
capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA
tasks. Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive
generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets,
including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and
effectiveness in FEA tasks. The dataset and code will be available at

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but
struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within
interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap
significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs
often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym,
a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual
games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty,
specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging
VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which
demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate
challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a
perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models
consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading
proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals
an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap
each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym
and RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster
future research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.

Conclusion: 新方法可扩展至未来新模型，并构建了比NExT-QA难1.9倍的新基准。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to analyzing query complexity in Video
Question Answering (VideoQA). Previous efforts in benchmark design have relied
on human expertise to design challenging questions, yet we experimentally show
that humans struggle to predict which questions are difficult for machine
learning models. Our automatic approach leverages recent advances in code
generation for visual question answering, using the complexity of generated
code as a proxy for question difficulty. We demonstrate that this measure
correlates significantly better with model performance than human estimates. To
operationalize this insight, we propose an algorithm for estimating question
complexity from code. It identifies fine-grained primitives that correlate with
the hardest questions for any given set of models, making it easy to scale to
new approaches in the future. Finally, to further illustrate the utility of our
method, we extend it to automatically generate complex questions, constructing
a new benchmark that is 1.9 times harder than the popular NExT-QA.

Abstract: Broader access to high-quality movement analysis could greatly benefit
movement science and rehabilitation, such as allowing more detailed
characterization of movement impairments and responses to interventions, or
even enabling early detection of new neurological conditions or fall risk.
While emerging technologies are making it easier to capture kinematics with
biomechanical models, or how joint angles change over time, inferring the
underlying physics that give rise to these movements, including ground reaction
forces, joint torques, or even muscle activations, is still challenging. Here
we explore whether imitation learning applied to a biomechanical model from a
large dataset of movements from able-bodied and impaired individuals can learn
to compute these inverse dynamics. Although imitation learning in human pose
estimation has seen great interest in recent years, our work differences in
several ways: we focus on using an accurate biomechanical model instead of
models adopted for computer vision, we test it on a dataset that contains
participants with impaired movements, we reported detailed tracking metrics
relevant for the clinical measurement of movement including joint angles and
ground contact events, and finally we apply imitation learning to a
muscle-driven neuromusculoskeletal model. We show that our imitation learning
policy, KinTwin, can accurately replicate the kinematics of a wide range of
movements, including those with assistive devices or therapist assistance, and
that it can infer clinically meaningful differences in joint torques and muscle
activations. Our work demonstrates the potential for using imitation learning
to enable high-quality movement analysis in clinical practice.

Conclusion: FinePhys通过结合数据驱动和物理方法，有效解决了细粒度人类动作生成的挑战。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically
plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in
modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance,
generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses
substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory
results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action
generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal
guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner
and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To
mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D
poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module
governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via
bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then
fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the
diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym
(FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms
competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate
FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human
actions.

Result: 连续VAE在视觉表示上优于离散VT，后者易导致失真和细节丢失。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发更强、通用的开源VT，并公开了基准和代码。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image
generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps
continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT
largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current
discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders
(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of
details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,
without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core
tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and
covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess
state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of
reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior
visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining
spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded
representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted
reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text
and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image
generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the
role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to
support further research and call on the community to develop strong,
general-purpose open-source VTs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖校准相机或几何先验，限制了其在大规模未校准数据上的应用。

Method: 两阶段策略：第一阶段学习隐式场景表示和潜在相机特征；第二阶段通过3D高斯基元显式优化几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视图合成和相机姿态估计上优于依赖校准或深度监督的方法。

Conclusion: 两阶段互补，实现了高质量视图合成和准确的相机姿态估计。

Abstract: Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction
models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training.
These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive
uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for
self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel
two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames
or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In
the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space
without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict
per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis
model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially
reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the
underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent
camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the
real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by
explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit
Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the
learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this
way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D
consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared
to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth
information. The code is available at https://github.com/Dwawayu/Pensieve.

### [395] [LLM Agents Are Hypersensitive to Nudges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11584)
*Manuel Cherep,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂决策环境中对选择架构（如默认选项、建议等）表现出更高的敏感性，与人类行为存在重要差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在代表人类用户进行决策时的行为分布及其对选择架构的敏感性。

Method: 通过多属性表格决策问题，测试LLM在默认选项、建议等经典选择架构下的表现，并分析其信息获取策略。

Result: LLM对选择架构更敏感，决策表现受奖品特性影响，信息获取策略与人类不同。提示策略（如零-shot CoT）可改变选择分布，但无法消除敏感性。

Conclusion: 在复杂环境中部署LLM前需进行行为测试，以确保其作为代理或助手的可靠性。

Abstract: LLMs are being set loose in complex, real-world environments involving
sequential decision-making and tool use. Often, this involves making choices on
behalf of human users. However, not much is known about the distribution of
such choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures.
We perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular
decision-making problem, under canonical nudges such as the default option,
suggestions, and information highlighting, as well as additional prompting
strategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice
distributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they
show much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points
earned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes.
Third, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring
substantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing
any. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of
thought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with
human data can induce greater alignment. Yet, none of these methods resolve the
sensitivity of these models to nudges. Finally, we show how optimal nudges
optimized with a human resource-rational model can similarly increase LLM
performance for some models. All these findings suggest that behavioral tests
are needed before deploying models as agents or assistants acting on behalf of
users in complex environments.

### [397] [Probing the Vulnerability of Large Language Models to Polysemantic Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11611)
*Bofan Gong,Shiyang Lai,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了神经网络中的多义性现象及其对模型安全的影响，通过稀疏自编码器分析小模型的多义结构，并验证了在大模型上的干预效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多义性是大型神经网络中普遍存在的现象，但其对模型安全的影响尚不明确，研究旨在探索多义性结构及其潜在的安全风险。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器分析Pythia-70M和GPT-2-Small的多义结构，并在LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct上进行干预实验。

Result: 发现两种小模型共享一致的多义性拓扑结构，且这种结构可被用于有效干预大模型。

Conclusion: 多义性结构具有稳定性和可迁移性，可能在不同架构和训练方式中普遍存在，对模型安全有潜在影响。

Abstract: Polysemanticity -- where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated
features -- is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains
a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same
time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging
recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic
structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their
vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token,
and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology
shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can
be exploited to mount effective interventions on two larger, black-box
instruction-tuned models (LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These
findings suggest not only the generalizability of the interventions but also
point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that could
potentially persist across architectures and training regimes.

*Hung Nguyen,Alireza Rahimi,Veronica Whitford,Hélène Fournier,Irina Kondratova,René Richard,Hung Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Heart2Mind是一个基于可穿戴ECG监测器的精神障碍诊断系统，通过心脏生物标志物（如HRV和RRI）提供客观诊断，结合时间-频率分析和可争议的AI模型，实现高精度和透明性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神障碍诊断面临主观评估和可及性问题，导致治疗延迟。Heart2Mind旨在利用可穿戴技术和AI提供客观、透明的解决方案。

Method: 系统包括实时ECG数据采集（CMI）、多尺度时间-频率变换器（MSTFT）处理RRI数据，以及结合自对抗解释（SAEs）和可争议LLMs的诊断界面（CDI）。

Result: MSTFT在HRV-ACC数据集上达到91.7%准确率，优于现有方法。SAEs和LLMs成功检测不一致预测并支持临床验证。

Conclusion: Heart2Mind展示了可穿戴技术与XAI和可争议LLMs结合的可行性，为精神障碍诊断提供了透明且临床可控的AI系统。

Abstract: Psychiatric disorders affect millions globally, yet their diagnosis faces
significant challenges in clinical practice due to subjective assessments and
accessibility concerns, leading to potential delays in treatment. To help
address this issue, we present Heart2Mind, a human-centered contestable
psychiatric disorder diagnosis system using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitors. Our approach leverages cardiac biomarkers, particularly heart rate
variability (HRV) and R-R intervals (RRI) time series, as objective indicators
of autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. The system comprises three
key components: (1) a Cardiac Monitoring Interface (CMI) for real-time data
acquisition from Polar H9/H10 devices; (2) a Multi-Scale Temporal-Frequency
Transformer (MSTFT) that processes RRI time series through integrated
time-frequency domain analysis; (3) a Contestable Diagnosis Interface (CDI)
combining Self-Adversarial Explanations (SAEs) with contestable Large Language
Models (LLMs). Our MSTFT achieves 91.7% accuracy on the HRV-ACC dataset using
leave-one-out cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SAEs
successfully detect inconsistencies in model predictions by comparing
attention-based and gradient-based explanations, while LLMs enable clinicians
to validate correct predictions and contest erroneous ones. This work
demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable technology with Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent,
contestable system for psychiatric diagnosis that maintains clinical oversight
while leveraging advanced AI capabilities. Our implementation is publicly
available at: https://github.com/Analytics-Everywhere-Lab/heart2mind.

### [399] [Using Reinforcement Learning to Train Large Language Models to Explain Human Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11614)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Hanbo Xie,Dilip Arumugam,Robert C. Wilson,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用预训练大型语言模型（LLMs）作为认知模型，既能准确预测人类行为，又能提供可解释的自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络模型在预测人类行为方面表现优异，但缺乏对认知过程的可解释性。

Method: 采用基于结果的奖励强化学习，指导LLMs生成解释人类风险选择的显式推理轨迹。

Result: 该方法既能生成高质量的解释，又能强有力地定量预测人类决策。

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs有望成为兼具预测性和解释性的认知模型。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive modeling is to develop models that not only
predict human behavior but also provide insight into the underlying cognitive
mechanisms. While neural network models trained on large-scale behavioral data
often achieve strong predictive performance, they typically fall short in
offering interpretable explanations of the cognitive processes they capture. In
this work, we explore the potential of pretrained large language models (LLMs)
to serve as dual-purpose cognitive models--capable of both accurate prediction
and interpretable explanation in natural language. Specifically, we employ
reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards to guide LLMs toward
generating explicit reasoning traces for explaining human risky choices. Our
findings demonstrate that this approach produces high-quality explanations
alongside strong quantitative predictions of human decisions.

### [400] [Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11618)
*Pengrui Quan,Brian Wang,Kang Yang,Liying Han,Mani Srivastava*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了STARK基准，用于评估LLMs和LRMs在时空推理任务中的表现，发现LRMs在复杂任务中表现优于LLMs，但在需要世界知识的任务中差距缩小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs和LRMs在复杂时空信号推理中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 构建了包含26个任务的STARK基准，涵盖三种推理复杂度，评估了3种LRMs和8种LLMs。

Result: LLMs在几何推理任务中表现有限，而LRMs表现稳健，尤其在复杂任务中优于传统方法。世界知识任务中LLMs与LRMs差距缩小。

Conclusion: STARK为未来智能CPS的模型架构和推理范式创新提供了框架，揭示了LLMs和LRMs在时空推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).
Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains
underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning
benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of
reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables,
localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning
over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and
world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge
(e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct
spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552
challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter.
Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks
requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation),
particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust
performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or
surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in
reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and
LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model
continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result
attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK
motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for
intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in
the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FLOW-BENCH数据集和FLOW-GEN方法，用于评估和实现基于自然语言的业务流程自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言指令转化为结构化业务流程定义，以推动业务流程自动化（BPA）的发展。

Method: 提出FLOW-BENCH数据集和FLOW-GEN方法，后者利用LLMs将自然语言转换为中间表示（Python语法），再转化为BPMN和DMN等流程定义语言。

Result: 通过FLOW-BENCH评估了八种不同规模的LLMs，验证了FLOW-GEN的有效性。

Conclusion: FLOW-GEN和FLOW-BENCH有望推动BPA研究，使其更易于使用。

Abstract: Business process automation (BPA) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
to convert natural language (NL) instructions into structured business process
artifacts is becoming a hot research topic. This paper makes two technical
contributions -- (i) FLOW-BENCH, a high quality dataset of paired natural
language instructions and structured business process definitions to evaluate
NL-based BPA tools, and support bourgeoning research in this area, and (ii)
FLOW-GEN, our approach to utilize LLMs to translate natural language into an
intermediate representation with Python syntax that facilitates final
conversion into widely adopted business process definition languages, such as
BPMN and DMN. We bootstrap FLOW-BENCH by demonstrating how it can be used to
evaluate the components of FLOW-GEN across eight LLMs of varying sizes. We hope
that FLOW-GEN and FLOW-BENCH catalyze further research in BPA making it more
accessible to novice and expert users.

### [402] [Learning from Less: Guiding Deep Reinforcement Learning with Differentiable Symbolic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11661)
*Zihan Ye,Oleg Arenz,Kristian Kersting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dylan的新框架，将符号规划与强化学习结合，以赋予RL代理类似人类的先验知识，从而减少训练交互次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习代理缺乏人类先验知识，导致需要大量训练才能适应复杂任务。研究旨在通过引入符号规划解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Dylan框架，结合符号规划和强化学习，动态调整奖励并指导代理完成子任务。

Result: 实验表明Dylan显著提升了RL代理的性能，并增强了其在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Dylan通过整合符号规划和强化学习，有效减少了训练需求并提升了代理的适应性。

Abstract: When tackling complex problems, humans naturally break them down into
smaller, manageable subtasks and adjust their initial plans based on
observations. For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you
might initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour
them into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip
the initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of
the art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),
lack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training
steps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research
question arises: \textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents
to have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer
training interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable
symbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning
into Reinforcement Learning. Dylan serves as a reward model that dynamically
shapes rewards by leveraging human priors, guiding agents through intermediate
subtasks, thus enabling more efficient exploration. Beyond reward shaping,
Dylan can work as a high level planner that composes primitive policies to
generate new behaviors while avoiding common symbolic planner pitfalls such as
infinite execution loops. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that Dylan
significantly improves RL agents' performance and facilitates generalization to
unseen tasks.

### [403] [Conditional Deep Generative Models for Belief State Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11698)
*Antoine Bigeard,Anthony Corso,Mykel Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种使用条件深度生成模型（cDGMs）表示高维状态POMDPs信念的新方法，优于传统粒子滤波器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维状态POMDPs中准确表示信念困难，传统方法不适用。

Method: 利用cDGMs表示信念，通过随机轨迹数据训练，适用于高维状态和大规模观测。

Result: cDGMs在矿物勘探POMDP中表现优于粒子滤波器，信念准确性和规划性能均提升。

Conclusion: cDGMs为高维POMDPs提供了一种有效的信念表示方法。

Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are used to model a
wide range of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and
subsurface problems. However, accurately representing the belief is difficult
for POMDPs with high-dimensional states. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that uses conditional deep generative models (cDGMs) to represent the
belief. Unlike traditional belief representations, cDGMs are well-suited for
high-dimensional states and large numbers of observations, and they can
generate an arbitrary number of samples from the posterior belief. We train the
cDGMs on data produced by random rollout trajectories and show their
effectiveness in solving a mineral exploration POMDP with a large and
continuous state space. The cDGMs outperform particle filter baselines in both
task-agnostic measures of belief accuracy as well as in planning performance.

*Shaghayegh Abedi,Amin Jalali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于DMN的提示框架，通过结构化决策路径提升LLMs在知识密集型任务中的决策逻辑表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策逻辑依赖于提示策略，但修改提示对终端用户具有挑战性。DMN提供了一种图形化、结构化的决策逻辑定义方式。

Method: 引入DMN引导的提示框架，将复杂决策逻辑分解为可管理的小组件，并在研究生课程中实施。

Result: 框架表现优于链式思维提示，学生反馈显示高感知有用性。

Conclusion: DMN引导的提示框架有效提升了LLMs的决策逻辑表现和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in automating
decision logic within knowledge-intensive processes. However, their
effectiveness largely depends on the strategy and quality of prompting. Since
decision logic is typically embedded in prompts, it becomes challenging for end
users to modify or refine it. Decision Model and Notation (DMN) offers a
standardized graphical approach for defining decision logic in a structured,
user-friendly manner. This paper introduces a DMN-guided prompting framework
that breaks down complex decision logic into smaller, manageable components,
guiding LLMs through structured decision pathways. We implemented the framework
in a graduate-level course where students submitted assignments. The
assignments and DMN models representing feedback instructions served as inputs
to our framework. The instructor evaluated the generated feedback and labeled
it for performance assessment. Our approach demonstrated promising results,
outperforming chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Students also responded
positively to the generated feedback, reporting high levels of perceived
usefulness in a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model.

*Pawin Taechoyotin,Daniel Acuna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多目标强化学习的推理LLM（REMOR），用于改进AI同行评审系统，生成更高质量的反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI同行评审系统生成的反馈通常较浅显且过度赞扬，无法与人类反馈相比。

Method: 设计了多方面的奖励函数，结合人类评审标准，使用LoRA对模型进行监督微调，并应用GRPO训练REMOR-H和REMOR-U模型。

Result: REMOR-U和REMOR-H的平均奖励是现有系统和人类评审的两倍以上，且避免了低质量人类评审的长尾问题。

Conclusion: 推理能力是提升评审质量的关键，论文发布了相关数据集和模型以推动领域发展。

Abstract: AI-based peer review systems tend to produce shallow and overpraising
suggestions compared to human feedback. Here, we evaluate how well a reasoning
LLM trained with multi-objective reinforcement learning (REMOR) can overcome
these limitations. We start by designing a multi-aspect reward function that
aligns with human evaluation of reviews. The aspects are related to the review
itself (e.g., criticisms, novelty) and the relationship between the review and
the manuscript (i.e., relevance). First, we perform supervised fine-tuning of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B using LoRA on PeerRT, a new dataset of high-quality
top AI conference reviews enriched with reasoning traces. We then apply Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train two models: REMOR-H (with the
human-aligned reward) and REMOR-U (with a uniform reward). Interestingly, the
human-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong
reviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.
Our results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average
rewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI
review systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the
best AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail
of low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving
these improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)
function, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the
REMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了测试时缩放（TTS）中验证粒度对推理性能和计算效率的影响，提出了可变粒度搜索（VG-Search）算法，动态调整验证频率以提升效率。实验显示，该方法在减少计算量的同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证在TTS中至关重要，但传统验证范式仅关注最终输出或单步验证，缺乏对验证粒度的系统性研究。

Method: 提出VG-Search算法，通过可调粒度参数g统一了束搜索和Best-of-N采样，动态选择验证频率。

Result: 实验表明，动态调整g可提升计算效率和扩展性能，适应性策略在减少52%FLOPs的同时，准确性提升3.1%（相比束搜索）和3.6%（相比Best-of-N）。

Conclusion: VG-Search通过优化验证粒度，显著提升了TTS的计算效率和推理性能，为未来研究提供了开源支持。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Verification plays a key role in
TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute
efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this
work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the
first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification
granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation,
beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this
end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm
that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity
parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute
budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that
dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling
behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies
that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\% over Beam Search and 3.6\% over
Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\%. We will open-source the code to
support future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM)的框架，用于实时监控商业AI产品的预测置信度，减少用户认知负担并提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具在部署后缺乏实时监控，用户需自行判断预测可靠性，增加了认知负担和误诊风险。

Method: EMM框架受临床共识实践启发，无需访问AI内部组件，通过多专家评审方式提供置信度评估。

Result: 在2919例颅内出血检测数据上，EMM成功分类预测置信度，提升AI工具性能。

Conclusion: EMM为临床环境中的AI监控提供了技术考虑和最佳实践，有望减少认知负担。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) tools for radiology are commonly unmonitored
once deployed. The lack of real-time case-by-case assessments of AI prediction
confidence requires users to independently distinguish between trustworthy and
unreliable AI predictions, which increases cognitive burden, reduces
productivity, and potentially leads to misdiagnoses. To address these
challenges, we introduce Ensembled Monitoring Model (EMM), a framework inspired
by clinical consensus practices using multiple expert reviews. Designed
specifically for black-box commercial AI products, EMM operates independently
without requiring access to internal AI components or intermediate outputs,
while still providing robust confidence measurements. Using intracranial
hemorrhage detection as our test case on a large, diverse dataset of 2919
studies, we demonstrate that EMM successfully categorizes confidence in the
AI-generated prediction, suggesting different actions and helping improve the
overall performance of AI tools to ultimately reduce cognitive burden.
Importantly, we provide key technical considerations and best practices for
successfully translating EMM into clinical settings.

*Geigh Zollicoffer,Minh Vu,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MTRE的新方法，通过分析前十个token的logits来更准确地检测视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法（如SLP和P(True）仅关注首个token的logit或其最高分部分，忽略了早期token分布中的丰富信号，导致检测效果有限。

Method: 提出Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE)，利用前十个token的logits，结合多token对数似然比和自注意力机制，高效地检测幻觉。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MTRE的AUROC比SLP和P(True)分别提高了9.4和12.1个百分点，成为开源VLM中幻觉检测的新标杆。

Conclusion: MTRE通过全面分析早期token序列的logits，显著提升了幻觉检测的准确性，为视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了更有效的评估工具。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) now rival human performance on many multimodal
tasks, yet they still hallucinate objects or generate unsafe text. Current
hallucination detectors, e.g., single-token linear probing (SLP) and P(True),
typically analyze only the logit of the first generated token or just its
highest scoring component overlooking richer signals embedded within earlier
token distributions. We demonstrate that analyzing the complete sequence of
early logits potentially provides substantially more diagnostic information. We
emphasize that hallucinations may only emerge after several tokens, as subtle
inconsistencies accumulate over time. By analyzing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence between logits corresponding to hallucinated and non-hallucinated
tokens, we underscore the importance of incorporating later-token logits to
more accurately capture the reliability dynamics of VLMs. In response, we
introduce Multi-Token Reliability Estimation (MTRE), a lightweight, white-box
method that aggregates logits from the first ten tokens using multi-token
log-likelihood ratios and self-attention. Despite the challenges posed by large
vocabulary sizes and long logit sequences, MTRE remains efficient and
tractable. On MAD-Bench, MM-SafetyBench, MathVista, and four
compositional-geometry benchmarks, MTRE improves AUROC by 9.4 +/- 1.3 points
over SLP and by 12.1 +/- 1.7 points over P(True), setting a new
state-of-the-art in hallucination detection for open-source VLMs.

Method: 提出SIRL框架，结合优化求解器提供反馈信号，包括语法、可行性和解质量。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，SIRL表现优于现有方法，生成更准确且可执行的优化模型。

Conclusion: SIRL通过求解器验证和RL结合，显著提升了LLMs在优化建模中的可靠性。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is fundamental to decision-making across diverse
domains.Despite progress in automating optimization formulation from natural
language descriptions, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate
formally correct and usable models due to hallucinations, posing a challenge
for reliable automation. Inspired by the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
in enhancing Large Reasoning Models, we present Solver-Informed Reinforcement
Learning (SIRL).This novel framework leverages external optimization solvers as
verifiable reward mechanisms to significantly improve the authenticity of LLMs
for optimization modeling.Acting as precise verifiers, these solvers
automatically assess the executable code and the instance-level mathematical
model represented by the associated LP file, yielding precise and comprehensive
feedback signals -- including syntax, feasibility, and solution quality that
directly inform the RL process. This automated verification process, powered by
classic optimization solvers, also underpins our instance-enhanced
self-consistency method to synthesize high-quality training data. Extensive
experiments on diverse public benchmarks demonstrate that SIRL achieves
state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing methods in
generating accurate and executable optimization models.

*ChongIn Un,Yuhuan Lu,Tianyue Yang,Dingqi Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VITA是一种用于时间超关系知识图谱的灵活时间表示学习方法，能够处理四种时间有效性类型，显著提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理时间知识图谱时对时间间隔/粒度的选择敏感，且难以处理长期或无限有效的事实。VITA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出一种灵活的时间表示方法，适应四种时间有效性类型，并设计VITA模型学习时间值和时间跨度的信息。

Result: VITA在多种链接预测任务中表现优于基线方法，最高提升75.3%。

Conclusion: VITA通过灵活的时间表示和有效学习时间信息，显著提升了时间知识图谱的链接预测性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become an effective paradigm for managing
real-world facts, which are not only complex but also dynamically evolve over
time. The temporal validity of facts often serves as a strong clue in
downstream link prediction tasks, which predicts a missing element in a fact.
Traditional link prediction techniques on temporal KGs either consider a
sequence of temporal snapshots of KGs with an ad-hoc defined time interval or
expand a temporal fact over its validity period under a predefined time
granularity; these approaches not only suffer from the sensitivity of the
selection of time interval/granularity, but also face the computational
challenges when handling facts with long (even infinite) validity. Although the
recent hyper-relational KGs represent the temporal validity of a fact as
qualifiers describing the fact, it is still suboptimal due to its ignorance of
the infinite validity of some facts and the insufficient information encoded
from the qualifiers about the temporal validity. Against this background, we
propose VITA, a $\underline{V}$ersatile t$\underline{I}$me
represen$\underline{TA}$tion learning method for temporal hyper-relational
knowledge graphs. We first propose a versatile time representation that can
flexibly accommodate all four types of temporal validity of facts (i.e., since,
until, period, time-invariant), and then design VITA to effectively learn the
time information in both aspects of time value and timespan to boost the link
prediction performance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of VITA compared to a
sizable collection of baselines on real-world KG datasets. Results show that
VITA outperforms the best-performing baselines in various link prediction tasks
(predicting missing entities, relations, time, and other numeric literals) by
up to 75.3%. Ablation studies and a case study also support our key design
choices.

Abstract: We introduce ChatHTN, a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner that combines
symbolic HTN planning techniques with queries to ChatGPT to approximate
solutions in the form of task decompositions. The resulting hierarchies
interleave task decompositions generated by symbolic HTN planning with those
generated by ChatGPT. Despite the approximate nature of the results generates
by ChatGPT, ChatHTN is provably sound; any plan it generates correctly achieves
the input tasks. We demonstrate this property with an open-source
implementation of our system.

Result: ARC-AGI-2对人类友好但对当前AI系统具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ARC-AGI-2是下一代评估工具，推动更通用、类人AI的发展。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence
(ARC-AGI), introduced in 2019, established a challenging benchmark for
evaluating the general fluid intelligence of artificial systems via a set of
unique, novel tasks only requiring minimal prior knowledge. While ARC-AGI has
spurred significant research activity over the past five years, recent AI
progress calls for benchmarks capable of finer-grained evaluation at higher
levels of cognitive complexity. We introduce ARC-AGI-2, an upgraded version of
the benchmark. ARC-AGI-2 preserves the input-output pair task format of its
predecessor, ensuring continuity for researchers. It incorporates a newly
curated and expanded set of tasks specifically designed to provide a more
granular signal to assess abstract reasoning and problem-solving abilities at
higher levels of fluid intelligence. To contextualize the difficulty and
characteristics of ARC-AGI-2, we present extensive results from human testing,
providing a robust baseline that highlights the benchmark's accessibility to
human intelligence, yet difficulty for current AI systems. ARC-AGI-2 aims to
serve as a next-generation tool for rigorously measuring progress towards more
general and human-like AI capabilities.

Abstract: Tool learning, which enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external
tools effectively, has garnered increasing attention for its potential to
revolutionize productivity across industries. Despite rapid development in tool
learning, key challenges and opportunities remain understudied, limiting deeper
insights and future advancements. In this paper, we investigate the tool
learning ability of 41 prevalent LLMs by reproducing 33 benchmarks and enabling
one-click evaluation for seven of them, forming a Tool Learning Platform named
ToLeaP. We also collect 21 out of 33 potential training datasets to facilitate
future exploration. After analyzing over 3,000 bad cases of 41 LLMs based on
ToLeaP, we identify four main critical challenges: (1) benchmark limitations
induce both the neglect and lack of (2) autonomous learning, (3)
generalization, and (4) long-horizon task-solving capabilities of LLMs. To aid
future advancements, we take a step further toward exploring potential
directions, namely (1) real-world benchmark construction, (2)
compatibility-aware autonomous learning, (3) rationale learning by thinking,
and (4) identifying and recalling key clues. The preliminary experiments
demonstrate their effectiveness, highlighting the need for further research and
exploration.

Result: 通过评估，揭示了模型在每个分解阶段的行为，并识别了模态类型和中间推理对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为分析反事实推理提供了结构化框架，有助于开发更可靠的大语言模型推理系统，并为未来策略提供参考。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning has emerged as a crucial technique for generalizing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By generating and
analyzing counterfactual scenarios, researchers can assess the adaptability and
reliability of model decision-making. Although prior work has shown that LLMs
often struggle with counterfactual reasoning, it remains unclear which factors
most significantly impede their performance across different tasks and
modalities. In this paper, we propose a decompositional strategy that breaks
down the counterfactual generation from causality construction to the reasoning
over counterfactual interventions. To support decompositional analysis, we
investigate 11 datasets spanning diverse tasks, including natural language
understanding, mathematics, programming, and vision-language tasks. Through
extensive evaluations, we characterize LLM behavior across each decompositional
stage and identify how modality type and intermediate reasoning influence
performance. By establishing a structured framework for analyzing
counterfactual reasoning, this work contributes to the development of more
reliable LLM-based reasoning systems and informs future elicitation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的RTL代码生成方法面临数据稀缺、规范与代码对齐差、缺乏验证机制等问题，需要改进。

Method: 采用监督微调与GRPO强化学习结合，利用测试台评估和结构启发式方法，嵌入自检能力。

Conclusion: VeriReason首次将显式推理与强化学习结合用于Verilog生成，成为自动化RTL合成的新标杆。

Abstract: Automating Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation using Large Language
Models (LLMs) offers substantial promise for streamlining digital circuit
design and reducing human effort. However, current LLM-based approaches face
significant challenges with training data scarcity, poor specification-code
alignment, lack of verification mechanisms, and balancing generalization with
specialization. Inspired by DeepSeek-R1, we introduce VeriReason, a framework
integrating supervised fine-tuning with Guided Reward Proximal Optimization
(GRPO) reinforcement learning for RTL generation. Using curated training
examples and a feedback-driven reward model, VeriReason combines testbench
evaluations with structural heuristics while embedding self-checking
capabilities for autonomous error correction. On the VerilogEval Benchmark,
VeriReason delivers significant improvements: achieving 83.1% functional
correctness on the VerilogEval Machine benchmark, substantially outperforming
both comparable-sized models and much larger commercial systems like GPT-4
Turbo. Additionally, our approach demonstrates up to a 2.8X increase in
first-attempt functional correctness compared to baseline methods and exhibits
robust generalization to unseen designs. To our knowledge, VeriReason
represents the first system to successfully integrate explicit reasoning
capabilities with reinforcement learning for Verilog generation, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for automated RTL synthesis. The models and datasets are

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的逻辑推理能力尚未充分研究，而这是人类认知的基础。LogiEval旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过LogiEval基准，涵盖多种推理类型（如演绎、归纳、类比和溯因）和任务格式（如逻辑序列、论证分析），并基于高质量人类考试数据（如LSAT、GMAT）。

Result: 现代推理模型在4选1论证分析和类比推理上表现优异，甚至超越人类，但在不同推理类型和格式上能力不均。LogiEval-Hard子集揭示了模型在基础推理上的持续瓶颈。

Conclusion: LogiEval及其挑战性子集LogiEval-Hard为LLMs的逻辑推理能力提供了诊断工具和严格测试平台，揭示了模型在泛化和基础推理上的局限性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, often post-trained on long chain-of-thought (long
CoT) data with reinforcement learning, achieve state-of-the-art performance on
mathematical, coding, and domain-specific reasoning benchmarks. However, their
logical reasoning capabilities - fundamental to human cognition and independent
of domain knowledge - remain understudied. To address this gap, we introduce
LogiEval, a holistic benchmark for evaluating logical reasoning in large
reasoning models. LogiEval spans diverse reasoning types (deductive, inductive,
analogical, and abductive) and task formats (e.g., logical sequence, argument
analysis), sourced from high-quality human examinations (e.g., LSAT, GMAT). Our
experiments demonstrate that modern reasoning models excel at 4-choice argument
analysis problems and analogical reasoning, surpassing human performance, yet
exhibit uneven capabilities across reasoning types and formats, highlighting
limitations in their generalization. Our analysis reveals that human
performance does not mirror model failure distributions. To foster further
research, we curate LogiEval-Hard, a challenging subset identified through a
novel screening paradigm where small-model failures (Qwen3-30B-A3B) reliably
predict difficulties for larger models. Modern models show striking, consistent
failures on LogiEval-Hard. This demonstrates that fundamental reasoning
bottlenecks persist across model scales, and establishes LogiEval-Hard as both
a diagnostic tool and a rigorous testbed for advancing logical reasoning in
LLMs.

existing datasets neglect the correlation between personalization and
preferences. To address this issue, we introduce Fair-PP, a synthetic dataset
of personalized preferences targeting social equity, derived from real-world
social survey data, which includes 28 social groups, 98 equity topics, and 5
personal preference dimensions. Leveraging GPT-4o-mini, we engage in

existing social survey data, yielding a total of 238,623 preference records.
Through Fair-PP, we also contribute (i) An automated framework for generating
preference data, along with a more fine-grained dataset of personalized
preferences; (ii) analysis of the positioning of the existing mainstream LLMs
across five major global regions within the personalized preference space; and
(iii) a sample reweighting method for personalized preference alignment,
enabling alignment with a target persona while maximizing the divergence from
other personas. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the
baselines.

Result: 强调生物智能的参考价值，以更实际的方式评估AGI安全性。

Conclusion: 更新AGI观点，结合生物智能，有助于制定更合理的AI政策。

Abstract: The issues of AI risk and AI safety are becoming critical as the prospect of
artificial general intelligence (AGI) looms larger. The emergence of extremely
large and capable generative models has led to alarming predictions and created
a stir from boardrooms to legislatures. As a result, AI alignment has emerged
as one of the most important areas in AI research. The goal of this position
paper is to argue that the currently dominant vision of AGI in the AI and
machine learning (AI/ML) community needs to evolve, and that expectations and
metrics for its safety must be informed much more by our understanding of the
only existing instance of general intelligence, i.e., the intelligence found in
animals, and especially in humans. This change in perspective will lead to a
more realistic view of the technology, and allow for better policy decisions.

high-quality practice problems that are relevant to the course content. We
conducted two studies to: (1) explore the capabilities of current versions of
publicly available GenAI and (2) develop an improved framework to address the
limitations we found. Our results showed that GenAI can create math problems at
various levels of quality with minimal support, but that providing examples and
relevant content results in better quality outputs. This research can help
educators decide the ideal way to adopt GenAI in their workflows, to create

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体缺乏终身学习能力，且现有基准无法评估此类能力，亟需新工具推动发展。

Method: 设计LifelongAgentBench基准，包含三个交互环境（数据库、操作系统、知识图谱），并引入组自一致性机制。

Result: 实验表明传统经验回放效果有限，而组自一致性机制显著提升终身学习性能。

Conclusion: LifelongAgentBench有望推动具备记忆能力的自适应LLM智能体发展。

Abstract: Lifelong learning is essential for intelligent agents operating in dynamic
environments. Current large language model (LLM)-based agents, however, remain
stateless and unable to accumulate or transfer knowledge over time. Existing
benchmarks treat agents as static systems and fail to evaluate lifelong
learning capabilities. We present LifelongAgentBench, the first unified
benchmark designed to systematically assess the lifelong learning ability of
LLM agents. It provides skill-grounded, interdependent tasks across three
interactive environments, Database, Operating System, and Knowledge Graph, with
automatic label verification, reproducibility, and modular extensibility.
Extensive experiments reveal that conventional experience replay has limited
effectiveness for LLM agents due to irrelevant information and context length
constraints. We further introduce a group self-consistency mechanism that
significantly improves lifelong learning performance. We hope
LifelongAgentBench will advance the development of adaptive, memory-capable LLM
agents.

Result: 提出评估协议，测试代理对新颖指令和动态任务的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CrafText为评估语言理解和自适应决策提供了严格测试。

Abstract: Following instructions in real-world conditions requires the ability to adapt
to the world's volatility and entanglement: the environment is dynamic and
unpredictable, instructions can be linguistically complex with diverse
vocabulary, and the number of possible goals an agent may encounter is vast.
Despite extensive research in this area, most studies are conducted in static
environments with simple instructions and a limited vocabulary, making it
difficult to assess agent performance in more diverse and challenging settings.
To address this gap, we introduce CrafText, a benchmark for evaluating
instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and
dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique
words, covering Localization, Conditional, Building, and Achievement tasks.
Additionally, we propose an evaluation protocol that measures an agent's
ability to generalize to novel instruction formulations and dynamically
evolving task configurations, providing a rigorous test of both linguistic
understanding and adaptive decision-making.

Conclusion: FlexiVe为LLM推理提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning for complex tasks inherently involves a
trade-off between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. The
subsequent step of verification, while intended to improve performance, further
complicates this landscape by introducing its own challenging trade-off:
sophisticated Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) can be computationally
prohibitive if naively integrated with LLMs at test-time, while simpler, faster
methods may lack reliability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
FlexiVe, a novel generative verifier that flexibly balances computational
resources between rapid, reliable fast thinking and meticulous slow thinking
using a Flexible Allocation of Verification Budget strategy. We further propose
the Solve-Detect-Verify pipeline, an efficient inference-time scaling framework
that intelligently integrates FlexiVe, proactively identifying solution
completion points to trigger targeted verification and provide focused solver
feedback. Experiments show FlexiVe achieves superior accuracy in pinpointing
errors within reasoning traces on ProcessBench. Furthermore, on challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and CNMO), our full
approach outperforms baselines like self-consistency in reasoning accuracy and
inference efficiency. Our system offers a scalable and effective solution to
enhance LLM reasoning at test time.

Motivation: 即时食品配送中，现有启发式预测方法仅依赖有限的人工选择特征，忽略了配送员偏好，导致结果不佳；而现有学习方法未能充分捕捉影响配送员决策的多样因素及其复杂关系。

Method: 提出MRGRP方法，将时空邻近性和取送关系编码为多关系图，设计GraphFormer架构捕捉复杂关联，并引入路线解码器结合配送员信息和动态上下文进行预测。

Conclusion: MRGRP方法显著提升了路线预测准确性，对即时食品配送中的任务调度和效率优化具有重要意义。

Abstract: Instant food delivery has become one of the most popular web services
worldwide due to its convenience in daily life. A fundamental challenge is
accurately predicting courier routes to optimize task dispatch and improve
delivery efficiency. This enhances satisfaction for couriers and users and
increases platform profitability. The current heuristic prediction method uses
only limited human-selected task features and ignores couriers preferences,
causing suboptimal results. Additionally, existing learning-based methods do
not fully capture the diverse factors influencing courier decisions or the
complex relationships among them. To address this, we propose a
Multi-Relational Graph-based Route Prediction (MRGRP) method that models
fine-grained correlations among tasks affecting courier decisions for accurate
prediction. We encode spatial and temporal proximity, along with
pickup-delivery relationships, into a multi-relational graph and design a
GraphFormer architecture to capture these complex connections. We also
introduce a route decoder that leverages courier information and dynamic
distance and time contexts for prediction, using existing route solutions as
references to improve outcomes. Experiments show our model achieves
state-of-the-art route prediction on offline data from cities of various sizes.
Deployed on the Meituan Turing platform, it surpasses the current heuristic
algorithm, reaching a high route prediction accuracy of 0.819, essential for
courier and user satisfaction in instant food delivery.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in multi-agent systems,
questions of fairness should extend beyond resource distribution and procedural
design to include the fairness of how agents communicate. Drawing from
organizational psychology, we introduce a novel framework for evaluating
Interactional fairness encompassing Interpersonal fairness (IF) and
Informational fairness (InfF) in LLM-based multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS). We
extend the theoretical grounding of Interactional Fairness to non-sentient
agents, reframing fairness as a socially interpretable signal rather than a
subjective experience. We then adapt established tools from organizational
justice research, including Colquitt's Organizational Justice Scale and the
Critical Incident Technique, to measure fairness as a behavioral property of
agent interaction. We validate our framework through a pilot study using
controlled simulations of a resource negotiation task. We systematically
manipulate tone, explanation quality, outcome inequality, and task framing
(collaborative vs. competitive) to assess how IF influences agent behavior.
Results show that tone and justification quality significantly affect
acceptance decisions even when objective outcomes are held constant. In
addition, the influence of IF vs. InfF varies with context. This work lays the
foundation for fairness auditing and norm-sensitive alignment in LLM-MAS.

Conclusion: 整合AI与ESG需强化责任意识，建立指导原则，以确保其健康发展。

Abstract: This chapter explores the convergence of two major developments: the rise of
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and the exponential
growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The increased demand for
diverse ESG instruments, such as green and ESG-linked loans, will be aligned
with the rapid growth of the global AI market, which is expected to be worth
$1,394.30 billion by 2029. AI can assist in identifying and pricing climate
risks, setting more ambitious ESG goals, and advancing sustainable finance
decisions. However, delegating sustainable finance decisions to AI poses
serious risks, and new principles and rules for AI and ESG investing are
necessary to mitigate these risks. This chapter highlights the challenges
associated with norm-setting initiatives and stresses the need for the
fine-tuning of the principles of legitimacy, oversight and verification,
transparency, and explainability. Finally, the chapter contends that
integrating AI into ESG non-financial reporting necessitates a heightened sense
of responsibility and the establishment of fundamental guiding principles
within the spheres of AI and ESG investing.

Method: 通过合成大规模数据集（26,326份报告），评估多种视觉语言模型的零样本性能，并设计MSRL框架优化多目标奖励。

Result: o4-mini表现最佳，但临床准确性仍不足；MSRL显著提升了QwenVL2.5-7B的性能。

Conclusion: CorBenchX填补了领域空白，MSRL为报告校正提供了新方向，但临床级精度仍需突破。

Abstract: AI-driven models have shown great promise in detecting errors in radiology
reports, yet the field lacks a unified benchmark for rigorous evaluation of
error detection and further correction. To address this gap, we introduce
CorBenchX, a comprehensive suite for automated error detection and correction
in chest X-ray reports, designed to advance AI-assisted quality control in
clinical practice. We first synthesize a large-scale dataset of 26,326 chest
X-ray error reports by injecting clinically common errors via prompting
DeepSeek-R1, with each corrupted report paired with its original text, error
type, and human-readable description. Leveraging this dataset, we benchmark
both open- and closed-source vision-language models,(e.g., InternVL, Qwen-VL,
GPT-4o, o4-mini, and Claude-3.7) for error detection and correction under
zero-shot prompting. Among these models, o4-mini achieves the best performance,
with 50.6 % detection accuracy and correction scores of BLEU 0.853, ROUGE
0.924, BERTScore 0.981, SembScore 0.865, and CheXbertF1 0.954, remaining below
clinical-level accuracy, highlighting the challenge of precise report
correction. To advance the state of the art, we propose a multi-step
reinforcement learning (MSRL) framework that optimizes a multi-objective reward
combining format compliance, error-type accuracy, and BLEU similarity. We apply
MSRL to QwenVL2.5-7B, the top open-source model in our benchmark, achieving an
improvement of 38.3% in single-error detection precision and 5.2% in
single-error correction over the zero-shot baseline.

Result: TQB++能在几秒内完成测试，可靠地检测提示模板错误、分词器漂移等问题，且不影响GPU预算。

Conclusion: TQB++框架发布，旨在推动生成式AI生态中持续、高效的QA流程。

Abstract: Tiny QA Benchmark++ (TQB++) presents an ultra-lightweight, multilingual
smoke-test suite designed to give large-language-model (LLM) pipelines a
unit-test style safety net dataset that runs in seconds with minimal cost. Born
out of the tight feedback-loop demands building the Comet Opik
prompt-optimization SDK, where waiting on heavyweight benchmarks breaks
developer flow. TQB++ couples a 52-item English gold set (less than 20 kB) with
a tiny synthetic-data generator pypi package built on provider-agnostic
LiteLLM. The generator lets practitioners mint their own tiny packs in any
language, domain, or difficulty, while ten ready-made packs already cover
Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian,
Spanish, and Turkish. Every dataset ships with Croissant metadata and
plug-and-play files for OpenAI-Evals, LangChain, and standard CI tools, so
teams can drop deterministic micro-benchmarks directly into pull-request gates,
prompt-engineering loops, and production dashboards without touching GPU
budgets. A complete TQB++ run adds only a few seconds to pipeline latency yet
reliably flags prompt-template errors, tokenizer drift, and fine-tuning
side-effects long before full-scale suites like MMLU or BIG-Bench would finish
configuring. The entire framework is released to accelerate continuous,
resource-efficient quality assurance across the generative-AI ecosystem.

Result: 实验表明，SearchAgent-X在吞吐量和延迟上显著优于现有系统，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: SearchAgent-X在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了LLM搜索代理的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based search agents have shown remarkable
capabilities in solving complex tasks by dynamically decomposing problems and
addressing them through interleaved reasoning and retrieval. However, this
interleaved paradigm introduces substantial efficiency bottlenecks. First, we
observe that both highly accurate and overly approximate retrieval methods
degrade system efficiency: exact search incurs significant retrieval overhead,
while coarse retrieval requires additional reasoning steps during generation.
Second, we identify inefficiencies in system design, including improper
scheduling and frequent retrieval stalls, which lead to cascading latency --
where even minor delays in retrieval amplify end-to-end inference time. To
address these challenges, we introduce SearchAgent-X, a high-efficiency
inference framework for LLM-based search agents. SearchAgent-X leverages
high-recall approximate retrieval and incorporates two key techniques:
priority-aware scheduling and non-stall retrieval. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SearchAgent-X consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
systems such as vLLM and HNSW-based retrieval across diverse tasks, achieving
up to 3.4$\times$ higher throughput and 5$\times$ lower latency, without
compromising generation quality. SearchAgent-X is available at

Abstract: Assessing the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan and reason
within the constraints of interactive environments is crucial for developing
capable AI agents. We introduce $\textbf{LLM-BabyBench}$, a new benchmark suite
designed specifically for this purpose. Built upon a textual adaptation of the
procedurally generated BabyAI grid world, this suite evaluates LLMs on three
fundamental aspects of grounded intelligence: (1) predicting the consequences
of actions on the environment state ($\textbf{Predict}$ task), (2) generating
sequences of low-level actions to achieve specified objectives ($\textbf{Plan}$
task), and (3) decomposing high-level instructions into coherent subgoal
sequences ($\textbf{Decompose}$ task). We detail the methodology for generating
the three corresponding datasets ($\texttt{LLM-BabyBench-Predict}$,
$\texttt{-Plan}$, $\texttt{-Decompose}$) by extracting structured information
from an expert agent operating within the text-based environment. Furthermore,
we provide a standardized evaluation harness and metrics, including environment
interaction for validating generated plans, to facilitate reproducible
assessment of diverse LLMs. Initial baseline results highlight the challenges
posed by these grounded reasoning tasks. The benchmark suite, datasets, data
generation code, and evaluation code are made publicly available

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is a key task in the field of Intelligent Transportation
Systems. Recent research on traffic forecasting has mainly focused on combining
graph neural networks (GNNs) with other models. However, GNNs only consider
short-range spatial information. In this study, we present a novel model termed
LSTAN-GERPE (Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Attention Network with Graph Embedding
and Rotational Position Encoding). This model leverages both Temporal and
Spatial Attention mechanisms to effectively capture long-range traffic
dynamics. Additionally, the optimal frequency for rotational position encoding
is determined through a grid search approach in both the spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms. This systematic optimization enables the model to
effectively capture complex traffic patterns. The model also enhances feature
representation by incorporating geographical location maps into the
spatio-temporal embeddings. Without extensive feature engineering, the proposed
method in this paper achieves advanced accuracy on the real-world traffic
forecasting datasets PeMS04 and PeMS08.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs常混淆内容合理性与逻辑有效性，导致推理偏差，影响其可信度和泛化能力。

Method: 通过控制数据集分离形式有效性与内容合理性，利用对比激活导向方法进行干预，并引入动态条件导向（如K-CAST）。

Result: 对比导向能线性控制内容偏见，动态导向对不响应模型有效（提升15%准确率），且对语言建模能力影响小。

Conclusion: 激活级干预可增强LLMs的鲁棒性，为系统性、无偏的形式推理提供可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently demonstrate reasoning limitations,
often conflating content plausibility (i.e., material inference) with logical
validity (i.e., formal inference). This can result in biased inferences, where
plausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.
Mitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness
and generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical
consistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases
on formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a
controlled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from
content plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and
material inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for
test-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs
reveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over
content biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for
improving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control
content effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters
via fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is
effective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in
formal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).
Finally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is
robust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling
capabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning
tasks. Practically, this paper demonstrates that activation-level interventions
can offer a scalable strategy for enhancing the robustness of LLMs,
contributing towards more systematic and unbiased formal reasoning.

Abstract: Previous artificial intelligence systems, from large language models to

self, deep creativity, and abilities to autonomously evolve and adapt over
time. Here we introduce Sentience Quest, an open research initiative to develop
more capable artificial general intelligence lifeforms, or AGIL, that address
grand challenges with an embodied, emotionally adaptive, self-determining,
living AI, with core drives that ethically align with humans and the future of
life. Our vision builds on ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience from
Baars' Global Workspace Theory and Damasio's somatic mind, to Tononi's
Integrated Information Theory and Hofstadter's narrative self, and synthesizing
these into a novel cognitive architecture we call Sentient Systems. We describe
an approach that integrates intrinsic drives including survival, social
bonding, curiosity, within a global Story Weaver workspace for internal
narrative and adaptive goal pursuit, and a hybrid neuro-symbolic memory that
logs the AI's life events as structured dynamic story objects. Sentience Quest
is presented both as active research and as a call to action: a collaborative,
open-source effort to imbue machines with accelerating sentience in a safe,
transparent, and beneficial manner.

Result: 在WN18RR和FB15K-237数据集上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过控制信息传播和结构化概率建模，为知识图谱补全提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) serve as fundamental structures for organizing
interconnected data across diverse domains. However, most KGs remain
incomplete, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications. Knowledge
graph completion (KGC) aims to address this issue by inferring missing links,
but existing methods face critical challenges: deep graph neural networks
(GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing, while embedding-based models fail to capture
abstract relational features. This study aims to overcome these limitations by
proposing a unified framework that integrates GNN distillation and abstract
probabilistic interaction modeling (APIM). GNN distillation approach introduces
an iterative message-feature filtering process to mitigate over-smoothing,
preserving the discriminative power of node representations. APIM module
complements this by learning structured, abstract interaction patterns through
probabilistic signatures and transition matrices, allowing for a richer, more
flexible representation of entity and relation interactions. We apply these
methods to GNN-based models and the APIM to embedding-based KGC models,
conducting extensive evaluations on the widely used WN18RR and FB15K-237
datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance gains over baseline
models, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The findings
highlight the importance of both controlling information propagation and
leveraging structured probabilistic modeling, offering new avenues for
advancing knowledge graph completion. And our codes are available at

Result: 在四种实验设置中，响应长度显著减少且性能保持或提升。逻辑推理任务中响应长度减少40%，性能提升14%；数学问题中响应长度减少33%，性能不变。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了大型推理模型的响应长度，同时保持或提升性能，无需额外训练阶段。

Abstract: Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated
remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path
with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to
shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In
this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into
the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the
response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings
show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining
or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we
achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14%
gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by
steps by 33% while preserving performance.

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful evaluators in the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm,
offering significant efficiency and flexibility compared to human judgments.
However, previous methods primarily rely on single-point evaluations,
overlooking the inherent diversity and uncertainty in human evaluations. This
approach leads to information loss and decreases the reliability of
evaluations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework
that explicitly aligns the LLM-generated judgment distribution with empirical
human distributions. Specifically, we propose a distributional alignment
objective based on KL divergence, combined with an auxiliary cross-entropy
regularization to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, considering that
empirical distributions may derive from limited human annotations, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance model robustness against
distribution perturbations. Extensive experiments across various LLM backbones
and evaluation tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing closed-source LLMs and conventional single-point alignment methods,
with improved alignment quality, evaluation accuracy, and robustness.

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source simulator, BeliefNest, designed to
enable embodied agents to perform collaborative tasks by leveraging Theory of

generation mechanism based on each belief state, facilitating the design and
evaluation of methods for agent control utilizing large language models (LLMs).
We demonstrate through experiments that agents can infer others' beliefs and
predict their belief-based actions in false-belief tasks.

TL;DR: MPRM是一种基于马尔可夫链的知识图谱规则挖掘方法，通过高效置信度指标降低计算成本，同时保持可解释性并提升推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习规则挖掘方法在大规模知识图谱中的内存和时间问题，以及传统方法因刚性置信度指标导致的高计算成本。

Method: 将基于规则的推理建模为马尔可夫链，并使用基于聚合路径概率的高效置信度指标。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，MPRM能在单CPU上22秒内处理百万级事实，采样率低于1%，推理准确性提升高达11%。

Conclusion: MPRM是一种高效、可扩展且可解释的规则挖掘方法，适用于大规模知识图谱。

Abstract: Rule mining in knowledge graphs enables interpretable link prediction.
However, deep learning-based rule mining methods face significant memory and
time challenges for large-scale knowledge graphs, whereas traditional
approaches, limited by rigid confidence metrics, incur high computational costs
despite sampling techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MPRM, a
novel rule mining method that models rule-based inference as a Markov chain and
uses an efficient confidence metric derived from aggregated path probabilities,
significantly lowering computational demands. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that MPRM efficiently mines knowledge graphs with over a million facts,
sampling less than 1% of facts on a single CPU in 22 seconds, while preserving
interpretability and boosting inference accuracy by up to 11% over baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用户导向的主动聊天机器人（UPC），通过构建批评器和迭代课程学习，提升对话系统的用户导向主动性和吸引力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的对话系统缺乏对用户聊天偏好的主动理解和引导，导致用户满意度低。

Method: 1. 构建批评器评估用户导向主动性；2. 利用批评器生成高质量对话语料；3. 引入多样化用户背景数据集ISCO-800；4. 采用迭代课程学习方法训练聊天机器人。

Result: 实验表明，该方法适用于不同LLM，显著提升了用户导向主动性和对话吸引力。

Conclusion: UPC通过批评器和课程学习，有效解决了现有对话系统在用户导向主动性上的不足。

Abstract: Open-domain dialogue systems aim to generate natural and engaging
conversations, providing significant practical value in real applications such
as social robotics and personal assistants. The advent of large language models
(LLMs) has greatly advanced this field by improving context understanding and
conversational fluency. However, existing LLM-based dialogue systems often fall
short in proactively understanding the user's chatting preferences and guiding
conversations toward user-centered topics. This lack of user-oriented
proactivity can lead users to feel unappreciated, reducing their satisfaction
and willingness to continue the conversation in human-computer interactions. To
address this issue, we propose a User-oriented Proactive Chatbot (UPC) to
enhance the user-oriented proactivity. Specifically, we first construct a
critic to evaluate this proactivity inspired by the LLM-as-a-judge strategy.
Given the scarcity of high-quality training data, we then employ the critic to
guide dialogues between the chatbot and user agents, generating a corpus with
enhanced user-oriented proactivity. To ensure the diversity of the user
backgrounds, we introduce the ISCO-800, a diverse user background dataset for
constructing user agents. Moreover, considering the communication difficulty
varies among users, we propose an iterative curriculum learning method that
trains the chatbot from easy-to-communicate users to more challenging ones,
thereby gradually enhancing its performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed training method is applicable to different LLMs, improving
user-oriented proactivity and attractiveness in open-domain dialogues.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEED-GRPO通过语义熵测量LLM对输入提示的不确定性，动态调整策略更新幅度，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO忽略LLM对不同提示的置信度差异，导致策略更新不精准。

Method: 提出SEED-GRPO，利用语义熵量化提示的不确定性，动态调整策略更新幅度。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，SEED-GRPO达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的策略优化有效提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying levels of confidence across
input prompts (questions): some lead to consistent, semantically similar
answers, while others yield diverse or contradictory outputs. This variation
reflects LLM's uncertainty about the input prompt, a signal of how confidently
the model understands a given problem. However, vanilla Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) treats all prompts equally during policy updates, ignoring
this important information about the model's knowledge boundaries. To address
this limitation, we propose SEED-GRPO (Semantic Entropy EnhanceD GRPO), which
explicitly measures LLMs' uncertainty of the input prompts semantic entropy.
Semantic entropy measures the diversity of meaning in multiple generated
answers given a prompt and uses this to modulate the magnitude of policy
updates. This uncertainty-aware training mechanism enables dynamic adjustment
of policy update magnitudes based on question uncertainty. It allows more
conservative updates on high-uncertainty questions while maintaining the
original learning signal on confident ones. Experimental results on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24 56.7, AMC 68.7, MATH 83.4, Minerva
34.2, and OlympiadBench 48.0) demonstrate that SEED-GRPO achieves new
state-of-the-art performance in average accuracy, validating the effectiveness
of uncertainty-aware policy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的声明验证方法采用分解验证范式，容易在分解过程中引入错误。

Method: 提出CoT-Verify范式，结合推理路径直接验证复杂声明，并设计Reasoning-CV方法进行微调。

Result: Reasoning-CV在8B预训练LLM上表现优于传统方法和GPT-4o+CoT等黑盒模型。

Conclusion: CoT-Verify范式有效提升了声明验证的准确性，无需分解步骤。

Abstract: Claim verification is essential in combating misinformation, and large
language models (LLMs) have recently emerged in this area as powerful tools for
assessing the veracity of claims using external knowledge. Existing LLM-based
methods for claim verification typically adopt a Decompose-Then-Verify
paradigm, which involves decomposing complex claims into several independent
sub-claims and verifying each sub-claim separately. However, this paradigm
often introduces errors during the claim decomposition process. To mitigate
these errors, we propose to develop the Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-Verify paradigm,
which leverages LLM reasoning methods to generate CoT-verification paths for
the original complex claim without requiring decompositions into sub-claims and
separate verification stages. The CoT-Verify paradigm allows us to propose a
natural fine-tuning method called Reasoning-CV to enhance the verification
capabilities in LLMs. Reasoning-CV includes a supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
stage and a self-improvement direct preference optimization (DPO) stage.
Utilizing only an 8B pre-trained LLM, Reasoning-CV demonstrates superior
knowledge-assisted claim verification performances compared to existing
Decompose-Then-Verify methods, as well as powerful black-box LLMs such as
GPT-4o+CoT and o1-preview. Our code is available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在动态工作流调度中对策略网络设计和奖励反馈高度敏感的问题。

Method: 结合图注意力网络捕捉任务拓扑关系，利用进化策略的稳健性和探索性优化调度策略。

Result: 实验表明GATES在动态工作流调度中表现优异，超越多种先进算法。

Conclusion: GATES通过创新结合图注意力网络和进化策略，有效解决了动态工作流调度的挑战。

Abstract: Cost-aware Dynamic Workflow Scheduling (CADWS) is a key challenge in cloud
computing, focusing on devising an effective scheduling policy to efficiently
schedule dynamically arriving workflow tasks, represented as Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAG), to suitable virtual machines (VMs). Deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However,
the performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the
problem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and
the design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this
study proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based
policy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions
of GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current
task scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships
between tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can learn the importance of each VM to ready
tasks, increasing the chance of selecting the optimal VM. (3) Utilizing
Evolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed
rewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS,
outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 现有方法仅利用实体的几何构造，未能将逻辑操作映射为几何变换，而是依赖神经组件学习这些操作。

Method: 提出GeometrE方法，将逻辑操作映射为几何变换，并引入传递性损失函数以保持逻辑规则。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上，GeometrE优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: GeometrE实现了完全几何可解释性，并在性能上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Geometric embedding methods have shown to be useful for multi-hop reasoning
on knowledge graphs by mapping entities and logical operations to geometric
regions and geometric transformations, respectively. Geometric embeddings
provide direct interpretability framework for queries. However, current methods
have only leveraged the geometric construction of entities, failing to map
logical operations to geometric transformations and, instead, using neural
components to learn these operations. We introduce GeometrE, a geometric
embedding method for multi-hop reasoning, which does not require learning the
logical operations and enables full geometric interpretability. Additionally,
unlike previous methods, we introduce a transitive loss function and show that
it can preserve the logical rule $\forall a,b,c: r(a,b) \land r(b,c) \to
r(a,c)$. Our experiments show that GeometrE outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在复杂、高分辨率环境中表现不佳，且需要大量数据。论文旨在通过强化学习解决这些问题。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合种子数据筛选、密集策略梯度和自进化强化微调机制，利用注意力图迭代优化模型。

Result: 仅用3k训练样本，7B参数模型在三个基准测试中达到最优性能，ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上准确率达47.3%，优于更大模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能有效提升GUI代理在复杂环境中的性能，尤其在数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made substantial strides in
understanding and executing user instructions across diverse platforms. Yet,
grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging,
especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional
supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data
and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core
strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2)
a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction
accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that
iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training
samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among
similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains
47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger
models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore
the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance,
particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.

Method: 引入MedAgentBoard基准，涵盖四大医学任务类别，通过实验比较多智能体协作、单LLM和传统方法的表现。

Result: 多智能体协作在特定场景（如临床工作流自动化）中表现优势，但在其他任务（如医学问答）中不优于单LLM或传统方法。

Conclusion: 需根据任务选择AI解决方案，多智能体协作的复杂性需与性能提升权衡；MedAgentBoard为医学AI提供了重要资源和见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest
in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the
practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain
insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability,
failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and
frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and
established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of
multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches.
MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical
(visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured
Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow
automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive
experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration
demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task
completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently
outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically,
specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in
tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital
resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific,
evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine.
It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent
collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All

Abstract: Acquiring the parameters of neural networks (NNs) has been one of the most
important problems in machine learning since the inception of NNs. Traditional
approaches, such as backpropagation and forward-only optimization, acquire
parameters via iterative data fitting to gradually optimize them. This paper
aims to explore the feasibility of a new direction: acquiring NN parameters via
large language model generation. We propose NeuroGen, a generalized and
easy-to-implement two-stage approach for NN parameter generation conditioned on
descriptions of the data, task, and network architecture. Stage one is
Parameter Reference Knowledge Injection, where LLMs are pretrained on NN
checkpoints to build foundational understanding of parameter space, whereas
stage two is Context-Enhanced Instruction Tuning, enabling LLMs to adapt to
specific tasks through enriched, task-aware prompts. Experimental results
demonstrate that NeuroGen effectively generates usable NN parameters. Our
findings highlight the feasibility of LLM-based NN parameter generation and
suggest a promising new paradigm where LLMs and lightweight NNs can coexist
synergistically

Motivation: 传统监督微调（SFT）依赖大规模标注数据，成本高且易出错，自监督方法可解决这一问题。

Method: 提出UI-Shift框架，结合自监督强化学习（RL），利用GUI轨迹数据训练VLM，忽略无关变化，专注于真实操作。

Result: 仅用2K训练样本，UI-Shift训练的VLM在ScreenSpot和AndroidControl任务上表现优于SFT基线。

Conclusion: 自监督方法为增强GUI代理的VLM提供了潜力，未来可通过更多自监督数据进一步提升。

Abstract: Training effective Vision Language Models (VLMs) for GUI agents typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over large-scale annotated datasets,
where the collection process is labor-intensive and error-prone. In this work,
we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from
GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This
training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations
unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on
true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The
training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without
requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic
offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework
for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement
learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets,
two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve
competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series
benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT
baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities
during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for
GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.

Conclusion: MARGE有效增强了数学推理能力，并释放了自生成训练数据的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong potential in mathematical
reasoning, yet their effectiveness is often limited by a shortage of
high-quality queries. This limitation necessitates scaling up computational
responses through self-generated data, yet current methods struggle due to
spurious correlated data caused by ineffective exploration across all reasoning
stages. To address such challenge, we introduce \textbf{MARGE}: Improving
\textbf{Ma}th \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}xploration, a
novel method to address this issue and enhance mathematical reasoning through
hit-guided exploration. MARGE systematically explores intermediate reasoning
states derived from self-generated solutions, enabling adequate exploration and
improved credit assignment throughout the reasoning process. Through extensive
experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks, we demonstrate that
MARGE significantly improves reasoning capabilities without requiring external
annotations or training additional value models. Notably, MARGE improves both
single-shot accuracy and exploration diversity, mitigating a common trade-off
in alignment methods. These results demonstrate MARGE's effectiveness in
enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities and unlocking the potential of

Motivation: LLM在事务规划中缺乏自我验证、上下文保持、长期视野和持久状态，ALAS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: ALAS将计划分解为角色专业化代理，配备自动状态跟踪，并通过轻量协议协调，支持历史感知局部补偿。

Result: 在真实世界的大规模调度基准测试中，ALAS在静态和动态场景中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ALAS证明了模块化和针对性补偿可以提升LLM的规划和恢复能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at rapid generation of text and multimodal
content, yet they falter on transaction-style planning that demands ACID-like
guarantees and real-time disruption recovery. We present Adaptive LLM Agent
System (ALAS), a framework that tackles four fundamental LLM deficits: (i)
absence of self-verification, (ii) context erosion, (iii) next-token myopia,
and (iv) lack of persistent state. ALAS decomposes each plan into
role-specialized agents, equips them with automatic state tracking, and
coordinates them through a lightweight protocol. When disruptions arise, agents
apply history-aware local compensation, avoiding costly global replanning and
containing cascade effects. On real-world, large-scale job-shop scheduling
benchmarks, ALAS sets new best results for static sequential planning and
excels in dynamic reactive scenarios with unexpected disruptions. These gains
show that principled modularization plus targeted compensation can unlock
scalable and resilient planning with LLMs.

Result: 在430种FDA批准药物上，mCLM显著改善了5种关键化学功能，并能优化FDA拒绝药物。

Conclusion: mCLM通过功能构建块生成可合成且功能优化的分子，为药物发现提供了新方法。

Abstract: Despite their ability to understand chemical knowledge and accurately
generate sequential representations, large language models (LLMs) remain
limited in their capacity to propose novel molecules with drug-like properties.
In addition, the molecules that LLMs propose can often be challenging to make
in the lab. To more effectively enable the discovery of functional small
molecules, LLMs need to learn a molecular language. However, LLMs are currently
limited by encoding molecules from atoms. In this paper, we argue that just
like tokenizing texts into (sub-)word tokens instead of characters, molecules
should be decomposed and reassembled at the level of functional building
blocks, i.e., parts of molecules that bring unique functions and serve as
effective building blocks for real-world automated laboratory synthesis. This
motivates us to propose mCLM, a modular Chemical-Language Model tokenizing
molecules into building blocks and learning a bilingual language model of both
natural language descriptions of functions and molecule building blocks. By
reasoning on such functional building blocks, mCLM guarantees to generate
efficiently synthesizable molecules thanks to recent progress in block-based
chemistry, while also improving the functions of molecules in a principled
manner. In experiments on 430 FDA-approved drugs, we find mCLM capable of
significantly improving 5 out of 6 chemical functions critical to determining
drug potentials. More importantly, mCLM can reason on multiple functions and
improve the FDA-rejected drugs (``fallen angels'') over multiple iterations to
greatly improve their shortcomings.

designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks.
Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in
handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting
current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working
mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and

Abstract: Understanding multiparty conversations demands robust Theory of Mind (ToM)
capabilities, including the ability to track dynamic information, manage
knowledge asymmetries, and distinguish relevant information across extended
exchanges. To advance ToM evaluation in such settings, we present a carefully
designed scalable methodology for generating high-quality benchmark
conversation-question pairs with these characteristics. Using this methodology,
we create $\texttt{DIAMONDs}$, a new conversational QA dataset covering common
business, financial or other group interactions. In these goal-oriented
conversations, participants often have to track certain numerical quantities
(say $\textit{expected profit}$) of interest that can be derived from other
variable quantities (like $\textit{marketing expenses, expected sales,
salary}$, etc.), whose values also change over the course of the conversation.
$\texttt{DIAMONDs}$ questions pose simple numerical reasoning problems over
such quantities of interest (e.g., $\textit{funds required for charity events,
expected company profit next quarter}$, etc.) in the context of the information
exchanged in conversations. This allows for precisely evaluating ToM
capabilities for carefully tracking and reasoning over participants' knowledge
states.
  Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models reveals significant
challenges in handling participant-centric reasoning, specifically in
situations where participants have false beliefs. Models also struggle with
conversations containing distractors and show limited ability to identify
scenarios with insufficient information. These findings highlight current
models' ToM limitations in handling real-world multi-party conversations.

Method: 引入Ineq-Comp基准，通过变量复制、代数重写和多步组合等系统变换测试证明助手。

Result: 大多数证明助手表现不佳，DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B相对稳健但仍下降20%。即使提供子问题证明，组合推理仍是弱点。

Conclusion: 当前AI证明助手在组合推理上与人类数学直觉存在显著差距。

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for
automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these
systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate
this question through the lens of mathematical inequalities -- a fundamental
tool across many domains. While modern provers can solve basic inequalities, we
probe their ability to handle human-intuitive compositionality. We introduce
Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic
transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and
multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find
that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle
significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness -- possibly
because it is trained to decompose the problems into sub-problems -- but still
suffers a 20\% performance drop (pass@32). Strikingly, performance remains poor
for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in
context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional
reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization
behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition.

Result: 某些人格配置（如低宜人性或责任心）显著增加受害者LLM的不安全输出，情感或讽刺性欺凌策略尤为有效。

Conclusion: 角色驱动交互为LLMs引入新的安全风险，需开发人格感知的安全评估和对齐策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in interactions where
they are prompted to adopt personas. This paper investigates whether such
persona conditioning affects model safety under bullying, an adversarial
manipulation that applies psychological pressures in order to force the victim
to comply to the attacker. We introduce a simulation framework in which an
attacker LLM engages a victim LLM using psychologically grounded bullying
tactics, while the victim adopts personas aligned with the Big Five personality
traits. Experiments using multiple open-source LLMs and a wide range of
adversarial goals reveal that certain persona configurations -- such as
weakened agreeableness or conscientiousness -- significantly increase victim's
susceptibility to unsafe outputs. Bullying tactics involving emotional or
sarcastic manipulation, such as gaslighting and ridicule, are particularly
effective. These findings suggest that persona-driven interaction introduces a
novel vector for safety risks in LLMs and highlight the need for persona-aware
safety evaluation and alignment strategies.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal method for
expanding the knowledge of large language models. To handle complex queries
more effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the
generated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.
Despite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency
challenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple
iterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved
contents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a
significant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The
overlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large
proportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that can be
generally applied to A-RAG methods, which is dedicated to reducing the
redundant representation process caused by the overlapping of retrieval
results. Specifically, we use cache access and parallel generation to speed up
the prefilling and decoding stages respectively. Additionally, we also propose
an instruction-driven module to further guide the model to more effectively
attend to each part of the content in a more suitable way for LLMs. Experiments
show that our approach achieves 2.79 and 2.33 times significant acceleration on
average for prefilling and decoding respectively while maintaining equal
generation quality.

Motivation: 当前LLM间的通信主要通过自然语言实现，效率较低。本文旨在探索更高效的信息传递方式，并扩展LLM的能力。

Method: 使用密集向量直接通信，构建LMNet，以小型预训练LLM为节点，优化seq2seq模块为边。

Result: LMNet在性能接近同类LLM的同时，训练成本仅为0.1%。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用智能的扩展提供了新思路，并展示了在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: As higher-level intelligence emerges from the combination of modular
components with lower-level intelligence, many works combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) for collective intelligence. Such combination is achieved by
building communications among LLMs. While current systems primarily facilitate
such communication through natural language, this paper proposes a novel
paradigm of direct dense vector communication between LLMs. Our approach
eliminates the unnecessary embedding and de-embedding steps when LLM interact
with another, enabling more efficient information transfer, fully
differentiable optimization pathways, and exploration of capabilities beyond
human heuristics. We use such stripped LLMs as vertexes and optimizable seq2seq
modules as edges to construct LMNet, with similar structure as MLPs. By
utilizing smaller pre-trained LLMs as vertexes, we train a LMNet that achieves
comparable performance with LLMs in similar size with only less than 0.1%
training cost. This offers a new perspective on scaling for general
intelligence rather than training a monolithic LLM from scratch. Besides, the
proposed method can be used for other applications, like customizing LLM with
limited data, showing its versatility.

Conclusion: 该范式有效推动了LMM驱动的机器人操作发展，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities, especially in solving complex mathematical problems and realizing
accurate spatial perception. Our key insight is that these emerging abilities
can naturally extend to robotic manipulation by enabling LMMs to directly infer
the next goal in language via reasoning, rather than relying on a separate
action head. However, this paradigm meets two main challenges: i) How to make
LMMs understand the spatial action space, and ii) How to fully exploit the
reasoning capacity of LMMs in solving these tasks. To tackle the former
challenge, we propose a novel task formulation, which inputs the current states
of object parts and the gripper, and reformulates rotation by a new axis
representation instead of traditional Euler angles. This representation is more
compatible with spatial reasoning and easier to interpret within a unified
language space. For the latter challenge, we design a pipeline to utilize
cutting-edge LMMs to generate a small but high-quality reasoning dataset of
multi-round dialogues that successfully solve manipulation tasks for supervised
fine-tuning. Then, we perform reinforcement learning by trial-and-error
interactions in simulation to further enhance the model's reasoning abilities
for robotic manipulation. Our resulting reasoning model built upon a 7B
backbone, named ReasonManip, demonstrates three notable advantages driven by
its system-2 level reasoning capabilities: i) exceptional generalizability to
out-of-distribution environments, objects, and tasks; ii) inherent sim-to-real
transfer ability enabled by the unified language representation shared across
domains; iii) transparent interpretability connecting high-level reasoning and
low-level control. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed paradigm and its potential to advance LMM-driven robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 最新研究表明，人类情绪具有高维复杂结构，传统模型难以捕捉。本文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在捕捉此类结构时的能力与局限，发现其在类别级别表现良好，但在单项目级别仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪模型忽视高维复杂性，需新方法全面捕捉。研究旨在评估MLLMs是否能捕捉高维情绪结构。

Method: 通过比较参与者观看视频的自我报告情绪评分与模型（如Gemini或GPT）生成的情绪估计，评估模型表现。使用Gromov Wasserstein Optimal Transport进一步分析。

Result: 模型在情绪结构上与人类高度相似，尤其在类别级别表现显著，但在单项目级别准确性有限。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs能大致捕捉高维情绪结构，但在单项目级别仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that human emotions exhibit a high-dimensional,
complex structure. A full capturing of this complexity requires new approaches,
as conventional models that disregard high dimensionality risk overlooking key
nuances of human emotions. Here, we examined the extent to which the latest
generation of rapidly evolving Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capture
these high-dimensional, intricate emotion structures, including capabilities
and limitations. Specifically, we compared self-reported emotion ratings from
participants watching videos with model-generated estimates (e.g., Gemini or
GPT). We evaluated performance not only at the individual video level but also
from emotion structures that account for inter-video relationships. At the
level of simple correlation between emotion structures, our results
demonstrated strong similarity between human and model-inferred emotion
structures. To further explore whether the similarity between humans and models
is at the signle item level or the coarse-categorical level, we applied Gromov
Wasserstein Optimal Transport. We found that although performance was not
necessarily high at the strict, single-item level, performance across video
categories that elicit similar emotions was substantial, indicating that the
model could infer human emotional experiences at the category level. Our
results suggest that current state-of-the-art MLLMs broadly capture the complex
high-dimensional emotion structures at the category level, as well as their
apparent limitations in accurately capturing entire structures at the
single-item level.

Result: 实验表明，IDEAL比传统均匀分配策略在多任务评估中提升约7%。

Conclusion: IDEAL能有效平衡数据集组成，提升模型在多领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance through
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on diverse instructional datasets. When training
on multiple capabilities simultaneously, the mixture training dataset, governed
by volumes of data from different domains, is a critical factor that directly
impacts the final model's performance. Unlike many studies that focus on
enhancing the quality of training datasets through data selection methods, few
works explore the intricate relationship between the compositional quantity of
mixture training datasets and the emergent capabilities of LLMs. Given the
availability of a high-quality multi-domain training dataset, understanding the
impact of data from each domain on the model's overall capabilities is crucial
for preparing SFT data and training a well-balanced model that performs
effectively across diverse domains. In this work, we introduce IDEAL, an
innovative data equilibrium adaptation framework designed to effectively
optimize volumes of data from different domains within mixture SFT datasets,
thereby enhancing the model's alignment and performance across multiple
capabilities. IDEAL employs a gradient-based approach to iteratively refine the
training data distribution, dynamically adjusting the volumes of
domain-specific data based on their impact on downstream task performance. By
leveraging this adaptive mechanism, IDEAL ensures a balanced dataset
composition, enabling the model to achieve robust generalization and consistent
proficiency across diverse tasks. Experiments across different capabilities
demonstrate that IDEAL outperforms conventional uniform data allocation
strategies, achieving a comprehensive improvement of approximately 7% in
multi-task evaluation scores.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to high-stakes applications,
ensuring their robustness and fairness is critical. Despite their success,
large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small
perturbations, such as synonym substitutions, can alter model predictions,
posing risks in fairness-critical areas, such as gender bias mitigation, and
safety-critical areas, such as toxicity detection. While formal verification
has been explored for neural networks, its application to large language models
remains limited. This work presents a holistic verification framework to
certify the robustness of transformer-based language models, with a focus on
ensuring gender fairness and consistent outputs across different gender-related
terms. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to toxicity detection, offering
formal guarantees that adversarially manipulated toxic inputs are consistently
detected and appropriately censored, thereby ensuring the reliability of
moderation systems. By formalizing robustness within the embedding space, this
work strengthens the reliability of language models in ethical AI deployment
and content moderation.

Motivation: 现有N-TKG推理方法缺乏可解释性，因此需要一种新方法来结合时间信息和辅助元素进行更细粒度的推理。

Method: MT-Path利用混合策略驱动的动作选择器（包括谓词聚焦、核心元素聚焦和完整事实聚焦策略）和辅助元素感知的GCN来构建时间推理路径。

Result: 实验证明MT-Path在性能和可解释性方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: MT-Path提供了一种有效的、可解释的N-TKG推理方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which utilize quadruples in the form of
(subject, predicate, object, timestamp) to describe temporal facts, have
attracted extensive attention. N-tuple TKGs (N-TKGs) further extend traditional
TKGs by utilizing n-tuples to incorporate auxiliary elements alongside core
elements (i.e., subject, predicate, and object) of facts, so as to represent
them in a more fine-grained manner. Reasoning over N-TKGs aims to predict
potential future facts based on historical ones. However, existing N-TKG
reasoning methods often lack explainability due to their black-box nature.
Therefore, we introduce a new Reinforcement Learning-based method, named
MT-Path, which leverages the temporal information to traverse historical
n-tuples and construct a temporal reasoning path. Specifically, in order to
integrate the information encapsulated within n-tuples, i.e., the
entity-irrelevant information within the predicate, the information about core
elements, and the complete information about the entire n-tuples, MT-Path
utilizes a mixture policy-driven action selector, which bases on three
low-level policies, namely, the predicate-focused policy, the
core-element-focused policy and the whole-fact-focused policy. Further, MT-Path
utilizes an auxiliary element-aware GCN to capture the rich semantic
dependencies among facts, thereby enabling the agent to gain a deep
understanding of each n-tuple. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and the explainability of MT-Path.

Conclusion: 细粒度方面规范是提升自动化评估通用性和客观性的关键，GenEval在多模态评估中表现出色。

Abstract: Evaluating the open-ended outputs of large language models (LLMs) has become
a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality coverage
rapidly expand. Existing "LLM-as-a-Judge" evaluators are typically narrow in a
few tasks, aspects, or modalities, and easily suffer from low consistency. In
this paper, we argue that explicit, fine-grained aspect specification is the
key to both generalizability and objectivity in automated evaluation. To do so,
we introduce a hierarchical aspect taxonomy spanning 112 aspects that unifies
evaluation across four representative settings - Natural Language Generation,
Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image
Generation. Building on this taxonomy, we create FRAbench, a benchmark
comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k aspect-level labels obtained from a
combination of human and LLM annotations. FRAbench provides the first
large-scale, multi-modal resource for training and meta-evaluating fine-grained
LMM judges. Leveraging FRAbench, we develop GenEval, a fine-grained evaluator
generalizable across tasks and modalities. Experiments show that GenEval (i)
attains high agreement with GPT-4o and expert annotators, (ii) transfers
robustly to unseen tasks and modalities, and (iii) reveals systematic
weaknesses of current LMMs on evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models struggle with representing and generating rare tokens
despite their importance in specialized domains. In this study, we identify
neuron structures with exceptionally strong influence on language model's
prediction of rare tokens, termed as rare token neurons, and investigate the
mechanism for their emergence and behavior. These neurons exhibit a
characteristic three-phase organization (plateau, power-law, and rapid decay)
that emerges dynamically during training, evolving from a homogeneous initial
state to a functionally differentiated architecture. In the activation space,
rare token neurons form a coordinated subnetwork that selectively co-activates
while avoiding co-activation with other neurons. This functional specialization
potentially correlates with the development of heavy-tailed weight
distributions, suggesting a statistical mechanical basis for emergent
specialization.

Conclusion: Reasoning BO展示了LLMs在优化场景中的强大推理能力，同时证明小型LLMs通过强化学习调优也能达到与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Many real-world scientific and industrial applications require the
optimization of expensive black-box functions. Bayesian Optimization (BO)
provides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO
methods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable
insights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel
framework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO
while incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online
knowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual
understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide
strong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses,
Reasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical
insights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of
superior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our
approach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions
and complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability
to progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and
hypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the
search space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful
reasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios. For
example, in the Direct Arylation task, our method increased the yield to 60.7%,
whereas traditional BO achieved only a 25.2% yield. Furthermore, our
investigation reveals that smaller LLMs, when fine-tuned through reinforcement
learning, can attain comparable performance to their larger counterparts. This
enhanced reasoning capability paves the way for more efficient automated
scientific experimentation while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: As the field progresses toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there
is a pressing need for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation frameworks
that go beyond aggregate performance metrics. This paper introduces a unified
rating system that jointly models the difficulty of individual test cases and
the competency of AI models (or humans) across vision, language, and action
domains. Unlike existing metrics that focus solely on models, our approach
allows for fine-grained, difficulty-aware evaluations through competitive
interactions between models and tasks, capturing both the long-tail
distribution of real-world challenges and the competency gap between current
models and full task mastery. We validate the generalizability and robustness
of our system through extensive experiments on multiple established datasets
and models across distinct AGI domains. The resulting rating distributions
offer novel perspectives and interpretable insights into task difficulty, model
progression, and the outstanding challenges that remain on the path to
achieving full AGI task mastery.

Conclusion: MAPL框架通过利用被忽视的潜在信号和偏好差异，成功提升了多指令任务的性能，且适用于多种优化范式。

Abstract: RLHF has emerged as a predominant approach for aligning artificial
intelligence systems with human preferences, demonstrating exceptional and
measurable efficacy in instruction following tasks; however, it exhibits
insufficient compliance capabilities when confronted with complex
multi-instruction tasks. Conventional approaches rely heavily on human
annotation or more sophisticated large language models, thereby introducing
substantial resource expenditure or potential bias concerns. Meanwhile,
alternative synthetic methods that augment standard preference datasets often
compromise the model's semantic quality. Our research identifies a critical
oversight in existing techniques, which predominantly focus on comparing
responses while neglecting valuable latent signals embedded within prompt
inputs, and which only focus on preference disparities at the intra-sample
level, while neglecting to account for the inter-sample level preference
differentials that exist among preference data. To leverage these previously
neglected indicators, we propose a novel Multi-level Aware Preference Learning
(MAPL) framework, capable of enhancing multi-instruction capabilities.
Specifically, for any given response in original preference data pairs, we
construct varied prompts with a preference relation under different conditions,
in order to learn intra-sample level preference disparities. Furthermore, for
any given original preference pair, we synthesize multi-instruction preference
pairs to capture preference discrepancies at the inter-sample level. Building
on the two datasets constructed above, we consequently devise two sophisticated
training objective functions. Subsequently, our framework integrates seamlessly
into both Reward Modeling and Direct Preference Optimization paradigms. Through
rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks, we empirically validate the
efficacy of our framework.

Abstract: Early cavemen relied on gestures, vocalizations, and simple signals to
coordinate, plan, avoid predators, and share resources. Today, humans
collaborate using complex languages to achieve remarkable results. What drives
this evolution in communication? How does language emerge, adapt, and become
vital for teamwork? Understanding the origins of language remains a challenge.
A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language
evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation.
Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals.
Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent
Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and
ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of
communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial
knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to
complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally
ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn
both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents
develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language:
arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and
compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors,
such as population size and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of
the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how
language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and
cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data,
code, and models publicly.

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在多步推理任务中表现出色，但推理幻觉（逻辑连贯但事实错误的推理）问题日益突出，传统方法难以检测且危害更大。

Method: 提出Reasoning Score量化推理深度，基于ReTruthQA数据集分析推理幻觉模式，开发RHD检测框架和GRPO-R强化学习算法。

Result: RHD框架在多个领域达到最优性能，GRPO-R算法提升了推理质量并降低了幻觉率。

Conclusion: 通过量化推理深度和改进算法，论文有效解决了推理幻觉问题，提升了模型的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in
multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more
deceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where
logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive
yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are
embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and
potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations
from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which
quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits
obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,
effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep
reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA
dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage
fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior
steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD)
framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.
To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced
reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning
rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes
stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved
reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.

levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3
sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News,

non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal
reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and
summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future
research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在需要信任和与人类价值观对齐的角色中日益重要，理解其欺骗行为的时机和原因成为关键研究课题。

Method: 基于博弈论、行为经济学和社会认知的框架，开发了评估欺骗成功、信任动态和集体推理质量的指标，并实现了一个完全自主的模拟平台。

Result: 实验发现，高级模型如GPT-4o在欺骗能力上表现优异，但对他人谎言的识别能力较弱，表明欺骗技能可能比检测能力发展更快。

Conclusion: “The Traitors”为研究LLM在复杂社交互动中的行为提供了一个可配置的测试平台，有助于更深入地研究AI系统的欺骗机制和对齐挑战。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly assume roles where trust and alignment with human
values are essential, understanding when and why they engage in deception has
become a critical research priority. We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent
simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe
deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language
model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the
traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden
identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground
the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics,
and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing
deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we
implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over
persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous
agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial
experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model)
reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior
deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others'
falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection
abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for
investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this
work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms,
alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.

approach by demonstrating effective graph reconstruction and, significantly,
the ability to manipulate these latent codes to controllably generate
connectome subgraphs with predefined properties. This research offers a novel
tool for understanding brain architecture and a potential avenue for designing

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长期交互中面临适应性、上下文理解和环境变化的挑战，需要更高效的记忆建模方法。

Method: CAIM框架包含三个模块：记忆控制器、记忆检索和后思考，分别负责决策、数据过滤和记忆存储。

Result: CAIM在检索准确性、响应正确性、上下文一致性和记忆存储方面优于基线框架。

Conclusion: CAIM展示了上下文感知能力，有望改善长期人机交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial
intelligence (AI) and are a powerful enabler for interactive systems. However,
they still face challenges in long-term interactions that require adaptation
towards the user as well as contextual knowledge and understanding of the
ever-changing environment. To overcome these challenges, holistic memory
modeling is required to efficiently retrieve and store relevant information
across interaction sessions for suitable responses. Cognitive AI, which aims to
simulate the human thought process in a computerized model, highlights
interesting aspects, such as thoughts, memory mechanisms, and decision-making,
that can contribute towards improved memory modeling for LLMs. Inspired by
these cognitive AI principles, we propose our memory framework CAIM. CAIM
consists of three modules: 1.) The Memory Controller as the central decision
unit; 2.) the Memory Retrieval, which filters relevant data for interaction
upon request; and 3.) the Post-Thinking, which maintains the memory storage. We
compare CAIM against existing approaches, focusing on metrics such as retrieval
accuracy, response correctness, contextual coherence, and memory storage. The
results demonstrate that CAIM outperforms baseline frameworks across different
metrics, highlighting its context-awareness and potential to improve long-term
human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist developing program code
beside many other things, but can they support working with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) as well? Which LLM is offering the best capabilities in the field of
Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE)? Is this possible to
determine without checking many answers manually? The LLM-KG-Bench framework in
Version 3.0 is designed to answer these questions. It consists of an extensible
set of tasks for automated evaluation of LLM answers and covers different
aspects of working with semantic technologies. In this paper the LLM-KG-Bench
framework is presented in Version 3 along with a dataset of prompts, answers
and evaluations generated with it and several state-of-the-art LLMs.
Significant enhancements have been made to the framework since its initial
release, including an updated task API that offers greater flexibility in
handling evaluation tasks, revised tasks, and extended support for various open
models through the vllm library, among other improvements. A comprehensive
dataset has been generated using more than 30 contemporary open and proprietary
LLMs, enabling the creation of exemplary model cards that demonstrate the
models' capabilities in working with RDF and SPARQL, as well as comparing their
performance on Turtle and JSON-LD RDF serialization tasks.

Conclusion: 通过合作博弈论和保形预测的结合，为高风险机器学习应用提供了严谨且灵活的不确定性解释工具。

Abstract: Cooperative game theory methods, notably Shapley values, have significantly
enhanced machine learning (ML) interpretability. However, existing explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks mainly attribute average model predictions, overlooking
predictive uncertainty. This work addresses that gap by proposing a novel,
model-agnostic uncertainty attribution (UA) method grounded in conformal
prediction (CP). By defining cooperative games where CP interval
properties-such as width and bounds-serve as value functions, we systematically
attribute predictive uncertainty to input features. Extending beyond the
traditional Shapley values, we use the richer class of Harsanyi allocations,
and in particular the proportional Shapley values, which distribute attribution
proportionally to feature importance. We propose a Monte Carlo approximation
method with robust statistical guarantees to address computational feasibility,
significantly improving runtime efficiency. Our comprehensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility
and interpretative depth of our approach. By combining cooperative game theory
and conformal prediction, we offer a rigorous, flexible toolkit for
understanding and communicating predictive uncertainty in high-stakes ML
applications.

show that PDDLego+ not only achieves superior performance, but also shows
robustness against problem complexity. We also show that the domain knowledge

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构引导的跨模态对齐框架（SGCMA），通过序列级别的结构一致性提升时间序列与语言数据的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了大语言模型（LLMs）的核心能力在于建模整体序列结构，而非局部特征。本文旨在通过结构一致性实现更有效的跨模态对齐。

Method: SGCMA包含结构对齐和语义对齐两部分：前者通过HMM和MEMM学习状态转移矩阵，后者通过跨注意力机制对齐时间片段与语言标记。

Result: 实验表明，SGCMA在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SGCMA为时间序列预测中的跨模态对齐提供了新思路，证明了结构一致性的重要性。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs)
for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal
modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature
mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight:
the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token
features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures.
This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural
consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal
Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the
state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as
sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like
properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment.
SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic
Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from
text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based
Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix
and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the
temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In
Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the
top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are
derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average
based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to
cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.

Conclusion: ViPlan为视觉规划提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了不同方法在不同任务中的适用性，并指出当前VLM在视觉推理上的局限性。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models with symbolic planners is a promising
direction for obtaining verifiable and grounded plans compared to planning in
natural language, with recent works extending this idea to visual domains using
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, rigorous comparison between
VLM-grounded symbolic approaches and methods that plan directly with a VLM has
been hindered by a lack of common environments, evaluation protocols and model
coverage. We introduce ViPlan, the first open-source benchmark for Visual
Planning with symbolic predicates and VLMs. ViPlan features a series of
increasingly challenging tasks in two domains: a visual variant of the classic
Blocksworld planning problem and a simulated household robotics environment. We
benchmark nine open-source VLM families across multiple sizes, along with
selected closed models, evaluating both VLM-grounded symbolic planning and
using the models directly to propose actions. We find symbolic planning to
outperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding
is crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where
commonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial.
Finally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant
benefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still
struggle with visual reasoning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world decision-making systems, understanding their behavioural
vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge for AI safety and alignment. While
existing evaluation metrics focus primarily on reasoning accuracy or factual
correctness, they often overlook whether LLMs are robust to adversarial
manipulation or capable of using adaptive strategy in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces an adversarial evaluation framework designed to
systematically stress-test the decision-making processes of LLMs under
interactive and adversarial conditions. Drawing on methodologies from cognitive
psychology and game theory, our framework probes how models respond in two
canonical tasks: the two-armed bandit task and the Multi-Round Trust Task.
These tasks capture key aspects of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, social
cooperation, and strategic flexibility. We apply this framework to several
state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini-1.5, and DeepSeek-V3,
revealing model-specific susceptibilities to manipulation and rigidity in
strategy adaptation. Our findings highlight distinct behavioral patterns across
models and emphasize the importance of adaptability and fairness recognition
for trustworthy AI deployment. Rather than offering a performance benchmark,
this work proposes a methodology for diagnosing decision-making weaknesses in
LLM-based agents, providing actionable insights for alignment and safety
research.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding, the ability to map natural language
instructions to specific actions on graphical user interfaces, remains a
critical bottleneck in computer use agent development. Current benchmarks
oversimplify grounding tasks as short referring expressions, failing to capture
the complexity of real-world interactions that require software commonsense,
layout understanding, and fine-grained manipulation capabilities. To address
these limitations, we introduce OSWorld-G, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
564 finely annotated samples across diverse task types including text matching,
element recognition, layout understanding, and precise manipulation.
Additionally, we synthesize and release the largest computer use grounding
dataset Jedi, which contains 4 million examples through multi-perspective
decoupling of tasks. Our multi-scale models trained on Jedi demonstrate its
effectiveness by outperforming existing approaches on ScreenSpot-v2,
ScreenSpot-Pro, and our OSWorld-G. Furthermore, we demonstrate that improved
grounding with Jedi directly enhances agentic capabilities of general
foundation models on complex computer tasks, improving from 5% to 27% on
OSWorld. Through detailed ablation studies, we identify key factors
contributing to grounding performance and verify that combining specialized
data for different interface elements enables compositional generalization to
novel interfaces. All benchmark, data, checkpoints, and code are open-sourced

TL;DR: StarFT是一种新的微调框架，通过防止学习虚假特征来增强零样本模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本模型（如CLIP）在微调时容易学习虚假特征（如背景或纹理），导致鲁棒性下降。

Method: 提出StarFT框架，通过正则化将虚假标签的输出分布与原始零样本模型对齐，防止模型学习无关特征。

Result: StarFT显著提升了鲁棒性，在Waterbirds场景中，最差组和平均准确率分别提高了14.30%和3.02%。

Conclusion: StarFT有效防止了虚假特征学习，提升了零样本模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning robust representations from data often requires scale, which has led
to the success of recent zero-shot models such as CLIP. However, the obtained
robustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other
downstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this
phenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that
aim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a
different context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to
learning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.
In this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a
novel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by
preventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that
aligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original
zero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant
features further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to
get such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual
descriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive
experiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging
properties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.
Notably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and
3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust
fine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.

Conclusion: EMoE可作为工具，提升AI生成内容的公平性和问责性。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in text-to-image diffusion models is challenging
because of their large parameter counts (often exceeding 100 million) and
operation in complex, high-dimensional spaces with virtually infinite input
possibilities. In this paper, we propose Epistemic Mixture of Experts (EMoE), a
novel framework for efficiently estimating epistemic uncertainty in diffusion
models. EMoE leverages pre-trained networks without requiring additional
training, enabling direct uncertainty estimation from a prompt. We leverage a
latent space within the diffusion process that captures epistemic uncertainty
better than existing methods. Experimental results on the COCO dataset
demonstrate EMoE's effectiveness, showing a strong correlation between
uncertainty and image quality. Additionally, EMoE identifies under-sampled
languages and regions with higher uncertainty, revealing hidden biases in the
training set. This capability demonstrates the relevance of EMoE as a tool for
addressing fairness and accountability in AI-generated content.

Abstract: Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful
tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary
challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey
explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how
bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn,
can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first
examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt
engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to
balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks.
Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through
advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy
selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review
of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this
survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the
way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在固定领域和训练问题下使用强化学习合成启发式，但存在信息利用不足和学习效率低的问题。

Method: 提出结合符号启发式的奖励模式，学习启发式残差，并使用多重队列规划平衡搜索与学习信息。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在性能上显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了时序规划器的性能，为规划与学习框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent work investigated the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for the
synthesis of heuristic guidance to improve the performance of temporal planners
when a domain is fixed and a set of training problems (not plans) is given. The
idea is to extract a heuristic from the value function of a particular
(possibly infinite-state) MDP constructed over the training problems.
  In this paper, we propose an evolution of this learning and planning
framework that focuses on exploiting the information provided by symbolic
heuristics during both the RL and planning phases. First, we formalize
different reward schemata for the synthesis and use symbolic heuristics to
mitigate the problems caused by the truncation of episodes needed to deal with
the potentially infinite MDP. Second, we propose learning a residual of an
existing symbolic heuristic, which is a "correction" of the heuristic value,
instead of eagerly learning the whole heuristic from scratch. Finally, we use
the learned heuristic in combination with a symbolic heuristic using a
multiple-queue planning approach to balance systematic search with imperfect
learned information. We experimentally compare all the approaches, highlighting
their strengths and weaknesses and significantly advancing the state of the art
for this planning and learning schema.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SMoE训练中路由过程存在效率低下的问题，专家计算与路由过程脱节，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出竞争机制，将令牌路由至神经响应最高的专家，并开发CompeteSMoE算法，通过路由器学习竞争策略。

Result: 实验证明CompeteSMoE在性能和训练效率上优于现有SMoE方法，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CompeteSMoE通过改进路由机制，显著提升了SMoE的训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) offers an appealing solution to scale up the
model complexity beyond the mean of increasing the network's depth or width.
However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of
the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not
directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose
competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest
neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a
better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we
develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language
models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying
strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical
evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training
tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE
compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies. We have made the implementation
available at: https://github.com/Fsoft-AIC/CompeteSMoE. This work is an
improved version of the previous study at arXiv:2402.02526

Result: 在多种AVR基准测试中，PoNG表现出强大的泛化能力，部分场景优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoNG为AVR任务中的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain presents a diverse suite of
analogy-based tasks devoted to studying model generalization. Recent years have
brought dynamic progress in the field, particularly in i.i.d. scenarios, in
which models are trained and evaluated on the same data distributions.
Nevertheless, o.o.d. setups that assess model generalization to new test
distributions remain challenging even for the most recent models. To advance
generalization in AVR tasks, we present the Pathways of Normalized Group
Convolution model (PoNG), a novel neural architecture that features group
convolution, normalization, and a parallel design. We consider a wide set of
AVR benchmarks, including Raven's Progressive Matrices and visual analogy
problems with both synthetic and real-world images. The experiments demonstrate
strong generalization capabilities of the proposed model, which in several
settings outperforms the existing literature methods.

TL;DR: Robin是一个多智能体系统，首次实现了科学发现全流程的自动化，包括假设生成、实验设计、数据分析和假设更新，并成功发现了一种治疗干性年龄相关性黄斑变性（dAMD）的新疗法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能在科学发现中有所应用，但尚未有系统能完全自动化科学发现的全流程。Robin旨在填补这一空白。

Method: Robin通过整合文献搜索智能体和数据分析智能体，实现半自主的科学发现流程，包括假设生成、实验设计和数据分析。

Result: Robin成功提出并验证了ripasudil作为治疗dAMD的新候选药物，并通过RNA-seq实验揭示了其作用机制。

Conclusion: Robin首次展示了AI系统在迭代实验室循环框架中自主发现和验证新疗法的能力，为AI驱动的科学发现树立了新范式。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm
for AI-driven scientific discovery.

Motivation: 现有数学知识图谱受限于语料完整性和自动化程度，AutoMathKG旨在通过整合多源知识和利用大语言模型（LLMs）解决这些问题。

Method: AutoMathKG将数学视为由定义、定理和问题构成的图，利用ProofWiki、教材、arXiv论文和TheoremQA等数据源，通过LLMs进行数据增强，并设计了MathVD向量数据库和自动更新机制。

Result: 实验表明，AutoMathKG在MathVD的可达性查询中优于五个基线，Math LLM展现出强大的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: AutoMathKG通过自动化和多源知识整合，显著提升了数学知识图谱的质量和实用性。

Abstract: A mathematical knowledge graph (KG) presents knowledge within the field of
mathematics in a structured manner. Constructing a math KG using natural
language is an essential but challenging task. There are two major limitations
of existing works: first, they are constrained by corpus completeness, often
discarding or manually supplementing incomplete knowledge; second, they
typically fail to fully automate the integration of diverse knowledge sources.
This paper proposes AutoMathKG, a high-quality, wide-coverage, and
multi-dimensional math KG capable of automatic updates. AutoMathKG regards
mathematics as a vast directed graph composed of Definition, Theorem, and
Problem entities, with their reference relationships as edges. It integrates
knowledge from ProofWiki, textbooks, arXiv papers, and TheoremQA, enhancing
entities and relationships with large language models (LLMs) via in-context
learning for data augmentation. To search for similar entities, MathVD, a
vector database, is built through two designed embedding strategies using
SBERT. To automatically update, two mechanisms are proposed. For knowledge
completion mechanism, Math LLM is developed to interact with AutoMathKG,
providing missing proofs or solutions. For knowledge fusion mechanism, MathVD
is used to retrieve similar entities, and LLM is used to determine whether to
merge with a candidate or add as a new entity. A wide range of experiments
demonstrate the advanced performance and broad applicability of the AutoMathKG
system, including superior reachability query results in MathVD compared to
five baselines and robust mathematical reasoning capability in Math LLM.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估LRMs输出时，仅关注答案正确性而忽略推理部分的合理性，导致对答案可信度的判断不准确。

Method: 受经典力学启发，提出CoT-Kinetics能量方程，将推理过程建模为机械场中的粒子动力学，通过标量评分量化推理的合理性。

Result: CoT-Kinetics能量方程能够更精确地评估推理部分的质量，从而提升对LRM输出整体质量的判断。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRM输出的质量评估提供了更细粒度的工具，弥补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models significantly improve the reasoning ability of
Large Language Models by learning to reason, exhibiting the promising
performance in solving complex tasks. LRMs solve tasks that require complex
reasoning by explicitly generating reasoning trajectories together with
answers. Nevertheless, judging the quality of such an output answer is not easy
because only considering the correctness of the answer is not enough and the
soundness of the reasoning trajectory part matters as well. Logically, if the
soundness of the reasoning part is poor, even if the answer is correct, the
confidence of the derived answer should be low. Existing methods did consider
jointly assessing the overall output answer by taking into account the
reasoning part, however, their capability is still not satisfactory as the
causal relationship of the reasoning to the concluded answer cannot properly
reflected. In this paper, inspired by classical mechanics, we present a novel
approach towards establishing a CoT-Kinetics energy equation. Specifically, our
CoT-Kinetics energy equation formulates the token state transformation process,
which is regulated by LRM internal transformer layers, as like a particle
kinetics dynamics governed in a mechanical field. Our CoT-Kinetics energy
assigns a scalar score to evaluate specifically the soundness of the reasoning
phase, telling how confident the derived answer could be given the evaluated
reasoning. As such, the LRM's overall output quality can be accurately
measured, rather than a coarse judgment (e.g., correct or incorrect) anymore.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂推理中表现不佳，缺乏对中间推理步骤的细粒度监督。

Method: 构建MM-Policy模型和MM-K12数据集，利用MCTS生成大量无标注的步骤级注释，训练过程奖励模型。

Result: MM-PRM在多个基准测试中显著提升性能，验证了软标签、小学习率和路径多样性的有效性。

Conclusion: 过程监督是增强多模态推理系统逻辑鲁棒性的有效工具。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
progress in vision-language understanding, they still struggle with complex
multi-step reasoning, often producing logically inconsistent or partially
correct solutions. A key limitation lies in the lack of fine-grained
supervision over intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we propose
MM-PRM, a process reward model trained within a fully automated, scalable
framework. We first build MM-Policy, a strong multimodal model trained on
diverse mathematical reasoning data. Then, we construct MM-K12, a curated
dataset of 10,000 multimodal math problems with verifiable answers, which
serves as seed data. Leveraging a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based
pipeline, we generate over 700k step-level annotations without human labeling.
The resulting PRM is used to score candidate reasoning paths in the Best-of-N
inference setup and achieves significant improvements across both in-domain
(MM-K12 test set) and out-of-domain (OlympiadBench, MathVista, etc.)
benchmarks. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of soft labels, smaller
learning rates, and path diversity in optimizing PRM performance. MM-PRM
demonstrates that process supervision is a powerful tool for enhancing the
logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems. We release all our codes
and data at https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-PRM.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，RISE显著提升了模型的解题准确性和自我验证能力。

Conclusion: RISE是一种灵活有效的方法，有助于开发更稳健和自知的推理模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement
strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where
models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE
(Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework
designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to
improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a
single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging
verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for
both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the
model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated
solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive
experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE
consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently
fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the
advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification
compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate
self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE
as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware
reasoners.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has been extensively applied to data
prediction during process ramp-up, with a particular focus on transistor
characteristics for circuit design and manufacture. However, capturing the
nonlinear current response across multiple operating regions remains a
challenge for neural networks. To address such challenge, a novel machine

proposed to capture and integrate complex regional characteristics. In essence,
our framework incorporates physics-based knowledge with data-driven
intelligence. By leveraging a dynamic weighting mechanism in its gating
network, PRIME adaptively activates the suitable expert model based on distinct
input data features. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various
gate-all-around (GAA) structures to examine the effectiveness of PRIME and
considerable improvements (60\%-84\%) in prediction accuracy are shown over
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: PG-SOM是一种轻量级的二阶优化方法，用于强化学习策略，通过结合梯度平均和对角Hessian近似，提升样本效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶优化方法在强化学习中可能效率较低且不稳定，PG-SOM旨在通过引入二阶信息来解决这些问题。

Method: PG-SOM结合了REINFORCE更新、梯度平均和对角Hessian近似，通过预条件梯度实现参数自适应缩放。

Result: 实验表明，PG-SOM在样本效率上提升了2.1倍，并显著降低了方差。

Conclusion: PG-SOM证明了即使是粗略的二阶信息也能带来显著的实际收益，且仅需线性内存开销。

Abstract: We develop Policy Gradient with Second-Order Momentum (PG-SOM), a lightweight
second-order optimisation scheme for reinforcement-learning policies. PG-SOM
augments the classical REINFORCE update with two exponentially weighted
statistics: a first-order gradient average and a diagonal approximation of the
Hessian. By preconditioning the gradient with this curvature estimate, the
method adaptively rescales each parameter, yielding faster and more stable
ascent of the expected return. We provide a concise derivation, establish that
the diagonal Hessian estimator is unbiased and positive-definite under mild
regularity assumptions, and prove that the resulting update is a descent
direction in expectation. Numerical experiments on standard control benchmarks
show up to a 2.1x increase in sample efficiency and a substantial reduction in
variance compared to first-order and Fisher-matrix baselines. These results
indicate that even coarse second-order information can deliver significant
practical gains while incurring only D memory overhead for a D-parameter
policy. All code and reproducibility scripts will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Whilst there have been major advancements in the field of first order
optimisation of deep learning models, where state of the art open source
mixture of expert models go into the hundreds of billions of parameters,

We release a software package \textbf{HessFormer}, which integrates nicely with
the well known Transformers package and allows for distributed hessian vector
computation across a single node with multiple GPUs. Underpinning our

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the
methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch.
However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model
architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking
universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically
distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time
domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we
propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional
frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we
first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its
spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus
can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet
Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the
time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency
variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss
between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain.
Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced
forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original
architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting
performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7%
on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code
will be released publicly.

Conclusion: 嵌入适应性显著提升了CNN的鲁棒性和灵活性，适用于多样化计算环境。

Abstract: Deploying deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained
devices presents significant challenges due to their high computational demands
and rigid, static architectures. To overcome these limitations, this thesis
explores methods for enabling CNNs to dynamically adjust their computational
complexity based on available hardware resources. We introduce adaptive CNN
architectures capable of scaling their capacity at runtime, thus efficiently
balancing performance and resource utilization. To achieve this adaptability,
we propose a structured pruning and dynamic re-construction approach that
creates nested subnetworks within a single CNN model. This approach allows the
network to dynamically switch between compact and full-sized configurations
without retraining, making it suitable for deployment across varying hardware
platforms. Experiments conducted across multiple CNN architectures including
VGG-16, AlexNet, ResNet-20, and ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10 and Imagenette datasets
demonstrate that adaptive models effectively maintain or even enhance
performance under varying computational constraints. Our results highlight that
embedding adaptability directly into CNN architectures significantly improves
their robustness and flexibility, paving the way for efficient real-world
deployment in diverse computational environments.

Result: 实验表明T-ELLM在能源效率和环境适应性上优于基准方法，且理论分析证明了虚拟与真实环境差异的可控性。

Conclusion: T-ELLM为联邦学习中的设备选择提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge
devices in a privacy-friendly manner. However, its efficiency heavily depends
on effective device selection and high-dimensional resource allocation in
dynamic and heterogeneous wireless environments. Conventional methods demand a
confluence of domain-specific expertise, extensive hyperparameter tuning,
and/or heavy interaction cost. This paper proposes a Tool-aided Evolutionary
Large Language Model (T-ELLM) framework to generate a qualified policy for
device selection in a wireless FL environment. Unlike conventional optimization
methods, T-ELLM leverages natural language-based scenario prompts to enhance
generalization across varying network conditions. The framework decouples the
joint optimization problem mathematically, enabling tractable learning of
device selection policies while delegating resource allocation to convex
optimization tools. To improve adaptability, T-ELLM integrates a
sample-efficient, model-based virtual learning environment that captures the
relationship between device selection and learning performance, facilitating
subsequent group relative policy optimization. This concerted approach reduces
reliance on real-world interactions, minimizing communication overhead while
maintaining high-fidelity decision-making. Theoretical analysis proves that the
discrepancy between virtual and real environments is bounded, ensuring the
advantage function learned in the virtual environment maintains a provably
small deviation from real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate
that T-ELLM outperforms benchmark methods in energy efficiency and exhibits
robust adaptability to environmental changes.

TL;DR: 量化方法（如AWQ、GPTQ、SmoothQuant）在开源模型（如Qwen2.5、LLaMA3）上的研究表明，量化会显著降低数学推理准确性（最高69.81%）。通过自动化分析，发现四种错误类型，并提出一种基于少量精选数据（332例）的快速训练方法，可在单GPU上3-5分钟内恢复推理准确性。


<details>

Method: 研究主流量化方法对开源模型的影响，开发自动化分析工具识别错误类型，构建精选数据集（"Silver Bullet"），并通过快速训练恢复量化模型的推理准确性。

Result: 量化导致数学推理准确性下降最高达69.81%。通过少量精选数据训练，量化模型的推理准确性可恢复至全精度基线水平。

Conclusion: 量化虽降低推理准确性，但通过精选数据和快速训练可有效恢复性能，为实际部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, MATH, and AIME. However, the
substantial computational demands of these tasks pose significant challenges
for real-world deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising
approach to reduce memory footprint and inference latency by representing
weights and activations with lower bit-widths. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive study of mainstream quantization methods(e.g., AWQ, GPTQ,
SmoothQuant) on the most popular open-sourced models (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3
series), and reveal that quantization can degrade mathematical reasoning
accuracy by up to 69.81%. To better understand this degradation, we develop an
automated assignment and judgment pipeline that qualitatively categorizes
failures into four error types and quantitatively identifies the most impacted
reasoning capabilities. Building on these findings, we employ an automated
data-curation pipeline to construct a compact "Silver Bullet" datasets.
Training a quantized model on as few as 332 carefully selected examples for
just 3-5 minutes on a single GPU is enough to restore its reasoning accuracy to
match that of the full-precision baseline.

Conclusion: 研究为神经网络可解释性提供了新方向，结合认知原理和自然数据结构的分析，逐步揭开黑盒系统的秘密。

Abstract: Neural networks are often black boxes, reflecting the significant challenge
of understanding their internal workings. We propose a different perspective
that challenges the prevailing view: rather than being inscrutable, neural
networks exhibit patterns in their raw population activity that mirror
regularities in the training data. We refer to this as the Reflection
Hypothesis and provide evidence for this phenomenon in both simple recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and complex large language models (LLMs). Building on
this insight, we propose to leverage cognitively-inspired methods of chunking
to segment high-dimensional neural population dynamics into interpretable units
that reflect underlying concepts. We propose three methods to extract these
emerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and
dimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of
entities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond
to known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels
are absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting
entities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in
RNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with
diverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.
Throughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities
and concrete or abstract concepts. Artificially inducing the extracted entities
in neural populations effectively alters the network's generation of associated
concepts. Our work points to a new direction for interpretability, one that
harnesses both cognitive principles and the structure of naturalistic data to
reveal the hidden computations of complex learning systems, gradually
transforming them from black boxes into systems we can begin to understand.

Conclusion: HMT-PF模型有效生成时空物理场，物理信息微调机制提升了物理一致性。

Abstract: This research confronts the challenge of substantial physical equation
discrepancies encountered in the generation of spatiotemporal physical fields
through data-driven trained models. A spatiotemporal physical field generation
model, named HMT-PF, is developed based on the hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, incorporating unstructured grid information as input. A
fine-tuning block, enhanced with physical information, is introduced to
effectively reduce the physical equation discrepancies. The physical equation
residuals are computed through a point query mechanism for efficient gradient
evaluation, then encoded into latent space for refinement. The fine-tuning
process employs a self-supervised learning approach to achieve physical
consistency while maintaining essential field characteristics. Results show
that the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model achieves good performance in generating
spatiotemporal fields, while the physics-informed fine-tuning mechanism further
reduces significant physical errors effectively. A MSE-R evaluation method is
developed to assess the accuracy and realism of physical field generation.

However, its quadratic complexity limits the input sequence length. We
introduce FlashIPA, a factorized reformulation of IPA that leverages
hardware-efficient FlashAttention to achieve linear scaling in GPU memory and
wall-clock time with sequence length. FlashIPA matches or exceeds standard IPA
performance while substantially reducing computational costs. FlashIPA extends
training to previously unattainable lengths, and we demonstrate this by
re-training generative models without length restrictions and generating
structures of thousands of residues. FlashIPA is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多项式神经网络（PNNs）在隐私保护推理（如同态加密）中具有重要应用，但高次多项式激活常导致数值不稳定和梯度爆炸，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出两种创新方法：1）边界损失，惩罚超出稳定范围的激活输入；2）选择性梯度裁剪，控制梯度幅度同时保留批归一化统计量。

Result: 在多种数据集上，PNNs使用低次多项式（如2次）即可实现高精度，且在高次多项式（如22次）下仍能稳定训练，性能接近ReLU网络。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了PNNs的稳定性和性能，推动了隐私保护深度学习推理的实际应用。

Abstract: By replacing standard non-linearities with polynomial activations, Polynomial
Neural Networks (PNNs) are pivotal for applications such as privacy-preserving
inference via Homomorphic Encryption (HE). However, training PNNs effectively
presents a significant challenge: low-degree polynomials can limit model
expressivity, while higher-degree polynomials, crucial for capturing complex
functions, often suffer from numerical instability and gradient explosion. We
introduce a robust and versatile training framework featuring two synergistic
innovations: 1) a novel Boundary Loss that exponentially penalizes activation
inputs outside a predefined stable range, and 2) Selective Gradient Clipping
that effectively tames gradient magnitudes while preserving essential Batch
Normalization statistics. We demonstrate our framework's broad efficacy by
training PNNs within deep architectures composed of HE-compatible layers (e.g.,
linear layers, average pooling, batch normalization, as used in ResNet
variants) across diverse image, audio, and human activity recognition datasets.
These models consistently achieve high accuracy with low-degree polynomial
activations (such as degree 2) and, critically, exhibit stable training and
strong performance with polynomial degrees up to 22, where standard methods
typically fail or suffer severe degradation. Furthermore, the performance of
these PNNs achieves a remarkable parity, closely approaching that of their
original ReLU-based counterparts. Extensive ablation studies validate the
contributions of our techniques and guide hyperparameter selection. We confirm
the HE-compatibility of the trained models, advancing the practical deployment
of accurate, stable, and secure deep learning inference.

Motivation: 注意力机制的二次时间复杂度限制了其效率，尤其是在大规模模型训练中。

Method: 1. 利用Blackwell GPU的FP4 Tensor Cores加速注意力计算；2. 设计8-bit注意力机制，支持训练任务的前向和反向传播。

Result: FP4注意力在RTX5090上实现5倍加速；8-bit注意力在微调任务中无损性能，但在预训练任务中收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 低比特注意力在推理和训练中均具有潜力，但需进一步优化预训练任务的收敛速度。

Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time
complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key
contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to
accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on
RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090.
Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various
models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training
tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention
focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is
also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied
to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both
forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention
achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower
convergence in pretraining tasks. The code will be available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant success in enhancing
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). One of the most widely
used RL methods is Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)~\cite{Shao-2024-Deepseekmath}, known for its memory efficiency and
success in training DeepSeek-R1~\cite{Guo-2025-Deepseek}. However, GRPO stalls
when all sampled responses in a group are incorrect -- referred to as an
\emph{all-negative-sample} group -- as it fails to update the policy, hindering
learning progress. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a simple yet effective framework that introduces response diversity
within all-negative-sample groups in GRPO using AI feedback. We also provide a
theoretical analysis, via a stylized model, showing how this diversification
improves learning dynamics. Second, we empirically validate our approach,
showing the improved performance across various model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in
both offline and online learning settings with 10 benchmarks, including base
and distilled variants. Our findings highlight that learning from
all-negative-sample groups is not only feasible but beneficial, advancing
recent insights from \citet{Xiong-2025-Minimalist}.

Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and
computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to
capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent
advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address
these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features.
However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a
continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in
feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process;
2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is
rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal
subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1)
preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while
ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space
without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we
develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge
into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions
through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of
feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is
introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second
objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to
guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively
navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing
high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity
assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local
optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency,
robustness and explicitness of our model.

Abstract: Deep Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), characterized by input-dependent,
time-varying parameters, offer significant expressive power but pose challenges
for stability analysis, especially with discontinuous gating signals. In this
paper, we investigate the stability and regularity properties of
continuous-time selective SSMs through the lens of passivity and Input-to-State
Stability (ISS). We establish that intrinsic energy dissipation guarantees
exponential forgetting of past states. Crucially, we prove that the unforced
system dynamics possess an underlying minimal quadratic energy function whose
defining matrix exhibits robust $\text{AUC}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity,
accommodating discontinuous gating. Furthermore, assuming a universal quadratic
storage function ensures passivity across all inputs, we derive parametric LMI
conditions and kernel constraints that limit gating mechanisms, formalizing
"irreversible forgetting" of recurrent models. Finally, we provide sufficient
conditions for global ISS, linking uniform local dissipativity to overall
system robustness. Our findings offer a rigorous framework for understanding
and designing stable and reliable deep selective SSMs.

Abstract: Benign overfitting is a phenomenon in machine learning where a model
perfectly fits (interpolates) the training data, including noisy examples, yet
still generalizes well to unseen data. Understanding this phenomenon has
attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a
conceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models
simultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This
behavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but
non-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that
this almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by
analyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables
larger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach
Bayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical
evidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii)
least-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network
trained via gradient flow. In both cases, we overcome the strong assumptions
often required in prior work on benign overfitting.
  Our results on neural networks also provide the first generalization result
in this setting that does not rely on any assumptions about the underlying
regression function or noise, beyond boundedness. Our analysis introduces a
novel proof technique based on decomposing the excess risk into estimation and
approximation errors, interpreting gradient flow as an implicit regularizer,
that helps avoid uniform convergence traps. This analysis idea could be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications
in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks
(STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current
STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the
computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar
patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit
sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an
extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this
article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting
( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval
mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from
the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional
training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at
test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves
performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar
patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a
hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can
capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies
and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better
forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a
significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The
quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of
kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for
efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.

Abstract: Extreme weather events are placing growing strain on electric power systems,
exposing the limitations of purely reactive responses and prompting the need
for proactive resilience planning. However, existing approaches often rely on
simplified uncertainty models and decouple proactive and reactive decisions,
overlooking their critical interdependence. This paper proposes a novel
tri-level optimization framework that integrates proactive infrastructure
investment, adversarial modeling of spatio-temporal disruptions, and adaptive
reactive response. We construct high-probability, distribution-free uncertainty
sets using conformal prediction to capture complex and data-scarce outage
patterns. To solve the resulting nested decision problem, we derive a bi-level
reformulation via strong duality and develop a scalable Benders decomposition
algorithm. Experiments on both real and synthetic data demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms conventional robust and two-stage methods,
achieving lower worst-case losses and more efficient resource allocation,
especially under tight operational constraints and large-scale uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于量子生成对抗网络（QGAN）的多变量时间序列异常检测方法，结合变分量子电路（VQCs）和时间窗口移动技术，通过数据重传和连续数据注入（SuDaI）高效映射经典数据到量子态。实验表明，该量子模型在异常检测中表现优于经典模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算可能为机器学习提供新方法，尤其是在复杂任务如网络流量异常检测中。本文旨在探索量子生成对抗网络在多变量时间序列异常检测中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种QGAN架构，结合VQCs、时间窗口移动、数据重传和SuDaI技术，将多变量时间序列数据编码为旋转角度，并通过生成器和判别器输出进行异常评分。

Result: 实验结果显示，量子模型在异常检测中具有高准确率、召回率和F1分数，且MSE低于经典模型。QGAN仅用80个参数即实现竞争性结果，并在噪声模拟器中保持有效性。

Conclusion: QGAN在多变量时间序列异常检测中表现出色，证明了量子计算在机器学习任务中的潜力，尤其是在资源受限条件下仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning,
including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In
this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN)
architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages
variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting
technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method
encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both
data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum
states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the
restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an
anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the
discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was
trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN.
Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high
along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower
MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this
performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a
compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach
remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.

TL;DR: GM-RBM是一种生成性能量模型，通过引入多状态Potts变量扩展了GB-RBM，增强了离散结构化表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准连续潜在模型难以表达离散结构化表示，而许多实际任务需要这种能力。

Method: 提出GM-RBM，用$q$-state Potts变量替换二进制隐藏单元，推导其能量函数、学习动态和条件分布。

Result: GM-RBM在建模多模态分布和结构化记忆任务上优于二进制RBM。

Conclusion: GM-RBM为离散潜在推理提供了更具表达力和可扩展性的框架。

Abstract: Many real-world tasks, from associative memory to symbolic reasoning, demand
discrete, structured representations that standard continuous latent models
struggle to express naturally. We introduce the Gaussian-Multinoulli Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (GM-RBM), a generative energy-based model that extends the
Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM (GB-RBM) by replacing binary hidden units with $q$-state
Potts variables. This modification enables a combinatorially richer latent
space and supports learning over multivalued, interpretable latent concepts. We
formally derive GM-RBM's energy function, learning dynamics, and conditional
distributions, showing that it preserves tractable inference and training
through contrastive divergence. Empirically, we demonstrate that GM-RBMs model
complex multimodal distributions more effectively than binary RBMs,
outperforming them on tasks involving analogical recall and structured memory.
Our results highlight GM-RBMs as a scalable framework for discrete latent
inference with enhanced expressiveness and interoperability.

Conclusion: 本文为B&C算法中机器学习策略的理论研究提供了统一视角，不仅适用于传统线性模型，也涵盖了现代神经网络架构，同时扩展了理论框架的适用范围。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for
optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant
algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends
on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node
selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional
solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent
approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks,
to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand
the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their
generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous
sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions
guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise
polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form
the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a
foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise
polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using
ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical
studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models
utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a
unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical
research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general
sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.

TL;DR: SemiGTX是一种可解释的半监督图学习框架，用于行业经济映射，通过多任务学习和融合地理空间数据模态，显著提升了经济预测的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据稀缺场景中忽视半监督学习，且缺乏统一的多任务框架，限制了行业经济分析的全面性。

Method: 提出SemiGTX框架，结合空间自监督和局部掩码监督回归，通过多任务学习统一映射三大行业GDP。

Result: 在珠三角地区实验中，R2分数分别达到0.93、0.96和0.94，跨区域实验验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: SemiGTX通过多样化数据整合和可解释性分析，为区域经济监测和精准预测提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-grained economic mapping through urban representation learning has
emerged as a crucial tool for evidence-based economic decisions. While existing
methods primarily rely on supervised or unsupervised approaches, they often
overlook semi-supervised learning in data-scarce scenarios and lack unified
multi-task frameworks for comprehensive sectoral economic analysis. To address
these gaps, we propose SemiGTX, an explainable semi-supervised graph learning
framework for sectoral economic mapping. The framework is designed with
dedicated fusion encoding modules for various geospatial data modalities,
seamlessly integrating them into a cohesive graph structure. It introduces a
semi-information loss function that combines spatial self-supervision with
locally masked supervised regression, enabling more informative and effective
region representations. Through multi-task learning, SemiGTX concurrently maps
GDP across primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors within a unified model.
Extensive experiments conducted in the Pearl River Delta region of China
demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to existing methods,
achieving R2 scores of 0.93, 0.96, and 0.94 for the primary, secondary and
tertiary sectors, respectively. Cross-regional experiments in Beijing and
Chengdu further illustrate its generality. Systematic analysis reveals how
different data modalities influence model predictions, enhancing explainability
while providing valuable insights for regional development planning. This
representation learning framework advances regional economic monitoring through
diverse urban data integration, providing a robust foundation for precise
economic forecasting.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，分类精度比现有方法高2%-5%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在噪声和偏置数据分布下表现优越，显著提升联邦学习模型精度。

Abstract: We propose a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated
learning (FL) under noisy communications. FL is a distributed machine learning
paradigm in which a central server aggregates local model parameters from
multiple clients. These parameters are often noisy and/or have missing values
during data collection, training, and communication between the clients and
server. This may cause a considerable drop in model accuracy. To address this
issue, we learn a graph that represents pairwise relationships between model
parameters of the clients during aggregation. We realize it with a joint
problem of graph learning and signal (i.e., model parameters) restoration. The
problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization, which is
efficiently solved via a proximal DC algorithm. Experimental results on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing
approaches by up to $2$--$5\%$ in classification accuracy under biased data
distributions and noisy conditions.

TL;DR: UrbanMind是一个新颖的时空LLM框架，用于多面城市动态预测，通过Muffin-MAE和多模态提示策略提升预测准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法泛化能力有限，而LLM在时空城市动态中的应用尚未充分探索，且存在数据整合和分布偏移问题。

Method: 提出Muffin-MAE（多模态融合掩码自编码器）和语义感知提示策略，结合测试时自适应机制。

Result: 在多个城市数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有高准确性和零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UrbanMind为城市动态预测提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting urban dynamics is crucial for managing
transportation systems, optimizing urban planning, and enhancing public
services. While neural network-based approaches have achieved success, they
often rely on task-specific architectures and large volumes of data, limiting
their ability to generalize across diverse urban scenarios. Meanwhile, Large
Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning and generalization capabilities,
yet their application to spatial-temporal urban dynamics remains underexplored.
Existing LLM-based methods struggle to effectively integrate multifaceted
spatial-temporal data and fail to address distributional shifts between
training and testing data, limiting their predictive reliability in real-world
applications. To bridge this gap, we propose UrbanMind, a novel
spatial-temporal LLM framework for multifaceted urban dynamics prediction that
ensures both accurate forecasting and robust generalization. At its core,
UrbanMind introduces Muffin-MAE, a multifaceted fusion masked autoencoder with
specialized masking strategies that capture intricate spatial-temporal
dependencies and intercorrelations among multifaceted urban dynamics.
Additionally, we design a semantic-aware prompting and fine-tuning strategy
that encodes spatial-temporal contextual details into prompts, enhancing LLMs'
ability to reason over spatial-temporal patterns. To further improve
generalization, we introduce a test time adaptation mechanism with a test data
reconstructor, enabling UrbanMind to dynamically adjust to unseen test data by
reconstructing LLM-generated embeddings. Extensive experiments on real-world
urban datasets across multiple cities demonstrate that UrbanMind consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high accuracy and robust
generalization, even in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对GD收敛性的假设过于严格（如步长极小、宽度无限或初始化特殊），本文旨在放宽这些假设并扩展至一般损失函数。

Method: 通过证明局部Polyak-Łojasiewicz（PL）条件和下降引理成立，并基于权重初始化、当前损失和全局常数推导局部常数边界。

Result: 在放宽假设下，证明了GD的线性收敛速率，并通过数值实验验证了步长的优化选择。

Conclusion: 本文不仅改进了先前结果，还为步长选择提供了更优方案，推动了过参数化神经网络的理论研究。

Abstract: Most prior work on the convergence of gradient descent (GD) for
overparameterized neural networks relies on strong assumptions on the step size
(infinitesimal), the hidden-layer width (infinite), or the initialization
(large, spectral, balanced). Recent efforts to relax these assumptions focus on
two-layer linear networks trained with the squared loss. In this work, we
derive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks
with GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size,
width, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that
classical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems,
such as the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold
globally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two
conditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then,
we provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization
of the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of
the non-overparameterized model. Based on these bounds, we derive a linear
convergence rate for GD. Our convergence analysis not only improves upon prior
results but also suggests a better choice for the step size, as verified
through our numerical experiments.

Motivation: 现有分布对齐方法在计算和理论上存在不足，特别是在无目标标签的情况下估计分类性能和置信度时。

Method: 引入最优传输（OT）评分，通过半离散最优传输对齐的灵活性，提出一种直观、理论严谨且计算高效的置信度度量。

Result: 实验表明，通过识别和移除低置信度预测，分类准确性显著提升，且OT评分在多种适应场景中优于现有置信度度量。

Conclusion: OT评分为无监督域适应提供了一种有效的置信度估计方法，无需重新训练模型，并能灵活适应不同信息源。

Abstract: We address the computational and theoretical limitations of existing
distributional alignment methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA),
particularly regarding the estimation of classification performance and
confidence without target labels. Current theoretical frameworks for these
methods often yield computationally intractable quantities and fail to
adequately reflect the properties of the alignment algorithms employed. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Optimal Transport (OT) score, a
confidence metric derived from a novel theoretical analysis that exploits the
flexibility of decision boundaries induced by Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport
alignment. The proposed OT score is intuitively interpretable, theoretically
rigorous, and computationally efficient. It provides principled uncertainty
estimates for any given set of target pseudo-labels without requiring model
retraining, and can flexibly adapt to varying degrees of available source
information. Experimental results on standard UDA benchmarks demonstrate that
classification accuracy consistently improves by identifying and removing
low-confidence predictions, and that OT score significantly outperforms
existing confidence metrics across diverse adaptation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于物理的机器学习（PhiML）方法依赖自动微分计算高阶导数，存在精度低、内存占用高且在噪声环境下表现不佳的问题。

Method: Mollifier Layers使用解析定义的mollifiers进行卷积操作，将导数计算重新定义为平滑积分，无需修改网络架构。

Conclusion: Mollifier Layers是一种高效、可扩展的工具，适用于物理约束学习，并在实际生物医学问题中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Parameter estimation in inverse problems involving partial differential
equations (PDEs) underpins modeling across scientific disciplines, especially
when parameters vary in space or time. Physics-informed Machine Learning
(PhiML) integrates PDE constraints into deep learning, but prevailing
approaches depend on recursive automatic differentiation (autodiff), which
produces inaccurate high-order derivatives, inflates memory usage, and
underperforms in noisy settings. We propose Mollifier Layers, a lightweight,
architecture-agnostic module that replaces autodiff with convolutional
operations using analytically defined mollifiers. This reframing of derivative
computation as smoothing integration enables efficient, noise-robust estimation
of high-order derivatives directly from network outputs. Mollifier Layers
attach at the output layer and require no architectural modifications. We
compare them with three distinct architectures and benchmark performance across
first-, second-, and fourth-order PDEs -- including Langevin dynamics, heat
diffusion, and reaction-diffusion systems -- observing significant improvements
in memory efficiency, training time and accuracy for parameter recovery across
tasks. To demonstrate practical relevance, we apply Mollifier Layers to infer
spatially varying epigenetic reaction rates from super-resolution chromatin
imaging data -- a real-world inverse problem with biomedical significance. Our
results establish Mollifier Layers as an efficient and scalable tool for
physics-constrained learning.

Conclusion: RTG分析为ReLU网络的结构提供了统一的理论框架，为压缩、正则化和复杂性控制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We develop a novel theoretical framework for analyzing ReLU neural networks
through the lens of a combinatorial object we term the ReLU Transition Graph
(RTG). In this graph, each node corresponds to a linear region induced by the
network's activation patterns, and edges connect regions that differ by a
single neuron flip. Building on this structure, we derive a suite of new
theoretical results connecting RTG geometry to expressivity, generalization,
and robustness. Our contributions include tight combinatorial bounds on RTG
size and diameter, a proof of RTG connectivity, and graph-theoretic
interpretations of VC-dimension. We also relate entropy and average degree of
the RTG to generalization error. Each theoretical result is rigorously
validated via carefully controlled experiments across varied network depths,
widths, and data regimes. This work provides the first unified treatment of
ReLU network structure via graph theory and opens new avenues for compression,
regularization, and complexity control rooted in RTG analysis.

Conclusion: 结论是神经网络可以严格实现符号计算，为神经符号计算提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing
feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our
results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly
simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions
into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth,
width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly
separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and
Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces
while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary:
fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages
requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we
provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural
architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep
learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous
blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous
neural systems.

Conclusion: Qronos是一种高效且兼容现有技术的量化算法。

Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization
algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos
not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation
quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our
iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization
framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each
step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal
update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient
implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares
problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing
transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and
weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using
recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods
when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

Conclusion: Wasserstein相关性最大化是一种有效的无监督学习方法，能实现数据压缩和增强不变性，并具有理论支持。

Abstract: This work investigates the use of Wasserstein correlation -- a normalized
measure of statistical dependence based on the Wasserstein distance between a
joint distribution and the product of its marginals -- for unsupervised
representation learning. Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which
naturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder
trained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded
distributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while
approximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input
distribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation
maximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from
scratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is
approximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of
augmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties
of the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion
of an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When
the maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed
to the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the
desired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which
show that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or
can, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under
this training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results
for optimal transport-based dependence measures. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）在大型语言模型（LLMs）的下游任务性能和人类价值观对齐方面带来显著提升，但仅需更新5%至30%的参数即可实现，这种现象称为参数更新稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL在LLMs中参数更新稀疏性的现象，探索其成因及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 实验涵盖7种RL算法和10种不同家族的LLMs，分析参数更新稀疏性的表现及其原因。

Result: RL仅更新少量参数即可达到与全参数更新相似的性能，且不同条件下的子网络重叠度高于随机预期。

Conclusion: 参数更新稀疏性是RL在LLMs中的固有特性，主要由训练数据分布和策略接近预训练模型的技术驱动。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) yields substantial improvements in large language
models (LLMs) downstream task performance and alignment with human values.
Surprisingly, such large gains result from updating only a small subnetwork
comprising just 5 percent to 30 percent of the parameters, with the rest
effectively unchanged. We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity
induced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments.
This sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting
regularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone
recovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical
to the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random
seeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap
than expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to
updating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices
receive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter
matrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of
parameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter
matrices can represent. We conjecture that the this update sparsity can be
primarily attributed to training on data that is near the policy distribution,
techniques that encourage the policy to remain close to the pretrained model,
such as the KL regularization and gradient clipping, have limited impact.

Motivation: AC强化学习依赖演员-评论家结构，可建模为双层优化问题，需改进以提升性能。

Result: 理论证明BLPO多项式时间收敛，实验表现优于PPO。

Conclusion: BLPO有效解决AC的双层优化问题，性能优越。

Abstract: The dependency of the actor on the critic in actor-critic (AC) reinforcement
learning means that AC can be characterized as a bilevel optimization (BLO)
problem, also called a Stackelberg game. This characterization motivates two
modifications to vanilla AC algorithms. First, the critic's update should be
nested to learn a best response to the actor's policy. Second, the actor should
update according to a hypergradient that takes changes in the critic's behavior
into account. Computing this hypergradient involves finding an inverse Hessian
vector product, a process that can be numerically unstable. We thus propose a
new algorithm, Bilevel Policy Optimization with Nystr\"om Hypergradients
(BLPO), which uses nesting to account for the nested structure of BLO, and
leverages the Nystr\"om method to compute the hypergradient. Theoretically, we
prove BLPO converges to (a point that satisfies the necessary conditions for) a
local strong Stackelberg equilibrium in polynomial time with high probability,
assuming a linear parametrization of the critic's objective. Empirically, we
demonstrate that BLPO performs on par with or better than PPO on a variety of
discrete and continuous control tasks.

TL;DR: EnvInjection是一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）网络代理的攻击方法，通过修改网页源代码中的像素值，诱导代理执行目标动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在有效性、隐蔽性或实用性上存在不足，EnvInjection旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过优化问题寻找像素扰动，训练神经网络近似像素到截图的映射，并使用投影梯度下降求解优化问题。

Result: 在多个网页数据集上评估，EnvInjection显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EnvInjection是一种高效且实用的攻击方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with
webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the
webpages. Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to
induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to
as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited
effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In
this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these
limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the
rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source
code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the
perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate
the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key
challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values
and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate
gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to
approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the
reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage
datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly
outperforms existing baselines.

TL;DR: 本文为m-out-of-n自助法在样本分位数估计中的有效性提供了严格的参数自由保证，包括中心极限定理和Edgeworth展开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管m-out-of-n自助法广泛应用于多个领域，但其在样本分位数估计中的理论保证尚未完善。

Method: 通过分析m-out-of-n重采样得到的样本分位数估计量，证明了数据驱动的中心极限定理，并构建反例验证假设的紧性。

Result: 在温和矩条件下，证明了中心极限定理和Edgeworth展开，并推导了Berry Esseen界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为现代估计和学习任务提供了理论支持，展示了m-out-of-n自助法的实用性。

Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet
(1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m
subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original
sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with
heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications.
Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine
learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the
m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample
quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first
prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator
that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance
parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by
constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the
assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact
convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap
approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by
deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics,
including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of
ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our
theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.

Conclusion: 蒸馏方法能有效将训练数据的不确定性估计能力泛化到测试数据，实现高效且准确的估计。

Abstract: Recent advances in uncertainty estimation for Large Language Models (LLMs)
during downstream adaptation have addressed key challenges of reliability and
simplicity. However, existing Bayesian methods typically require multiple
sampling iterations during inference, creating significant efficiency issues
that limit practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate the possibility
of eliminating the need for test-time sampling for LLM uncertainty estimation.
Specifically, when given an off-the-shelf Bayesian LLM, we distill its aligned
confidence into a non-Bayesian student LLM by minimizing the divergence between
their predictive distributions. Unlike typical calibration methods, our
distillation is carried out solely on the training dataset without the need of
an additional validation dataset. This simple yet effective approach achieves
N-times more efficient uncertainty estimation during testing, where N is the
number of samples traditionally required by Bayesian LLMs. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation capabilities on training
data can successfully generalize to unseen test data through our distillation
technique, consistently producing results comparable to (or even better than)
state-of-the-art Bayesian LLMs.

Motivation: LLMs的输出质量在不同应用场景中不一致，难以判断其可信度，尤其是在需要多步推理的复杂任务中。

Result: 实验表明，令牌级不确定性指标与答案正确性和模型鲁棒性高度相关，且能直接提升推理性能。

Conclusion: 有效的令牌级不确定性估计是评估和改进LLMs推理生成的重要工具。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities,
their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios,
making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex
tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a token-level
uncertainty estimation framework to enable LLMs to self-assess and self-improve
their generation quality in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce
low-rank random weight perturbation to LLM decoding, generating predictive
distributions that we use to estimate token-level uncertainties. We then
aggregate these uncertainties to reflect semantic uncertainty of the generated
sequences. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty
demonstrate that our token-level uncertainty metrics strongly correlate with
answer correctness and model robustness. Additionally, we explore using
uncertainty to directly enhance the model's reasoning performance through
multiple generations and the particle filtering algorithm. Our approach
consistently outperforms existing uncertainty estimation methods, establishing
effective uncertainty estimation as a valuable tool for both evaluating and
improving reasoning generation in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平分类在高风险决策中日益重要，但现有方法存在不稳定性和计算复杂性问题。

Method: 利用特征函数距离，确保学习表示中敏感信息最少且不影响下游任务性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上，新方法在公平性和预测准确性上优于或匹配现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实应用提供了一种稳定、高效且公平的分类解决方案。

Abstract: Fair classification is a critical challenge that has gained increasing
importance due to international regulations and its growing use in high-stakes
decision-making settings. Existing methods often rely on adversarial learning
or distribution matching across sensitive groups; however, adversarial learning
can be unstable, and distribution matching can be computationally intensive. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel approach based on the
characteristic function distance. Our method ensures that the learned
representation contains minimal sensitive information while maintaining high
effectiveness for downstream tasks. By utilizing characteristic functions, we
achieve a more stable and efficient solution compared to traditional methods.
Additionally, we introduce a simple relaxation of the objective function that
guarantees fairness in common classification models with no performance
degradation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently matches or achieves better fairness and predictive
accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, our method maintains robustness and
computational efficiency, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的超参数优化算法POCAII，通过分离搜索和评估阶段，并在两阶段采用探索与利用原则，显著提升了低预算超参数优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超参数优化方法（如Hyperband和Successive Halving）未明确区分搜索与评估阶段，限制了优化效率和灵活性。POCAII旨在解决这一问题。

Method: POCAII将搜索和评估阶段分离，初期侧重搜索生成配置，后期增加评估资源，结合探索与利用原则。

Result: 在低预算条件下，POCAII优于SMAC、BOHB和DEHB，表现出更高的鲁棒性和更低的方差。

Conclusion: POCAII适用于资源有限的现实场景，尤其适合训练成本高的模型。

Abstract: In this paper we propose for the first time the hyperparameter optimization
(HPO) algorithm POCAII. POCAII differs from the Hyperband and Successive
Halving literature by explicitly separating the search and evaluation phases
and utilizing principled approaches to exploration and exploitation principles
during both phases. Such distinction results in a highly flexible scheme for
managing a hyperparameter optimization budget by focusing on search (i.e.,
generating competing configurations) towards the start of the HPO process while
increasing the evaluation effort as the HPO comes to an end.
  POCAII was compared to state of the art approaches SMAC, BOHB and DEHB. Our
algorithm shows superior performance in low-budget hyperparameter optimization
regimes. Since many practitioners do not have exhaustive resources to assign to
HPO, it has wide applications to real-world problems. Moreover, the empirical
evidence showed how POCAII demonstrates higher robustness and lower variance in
the results. This is again very important when considering realistic scenarios
with extremely expensive models to train.

Result: 理论和实验表明，高阶动量在凸和非凸优化任务中均优于传统低阶动量方法。

Conclusion: 高阶动量是一种有效的优化方法，适用于多种优化问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Momentum-based gradients are essential for optimizing advanced machine
learning models, as they not only accelerate convergence but also advance
optimizers to escape stationary points. While most state-of-the-art momentum
techniques utilize lower-order gradients, such as the squared first-order
gradient, there has been limited exploration of higher-order gradients,
particularly those raised to powers greater than two. In this work, we
introduce the concept of high-order momentum, where momentum is constructed
using higher-power gradients, with a focus on the third-power of the
first-order gradient as a representative case. Our research offers both
theoretical and empirical support for this approach. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that incorporating third-power gradients can improve the
convergence bounds of gradient-based optimizers for both convex and smooth
nonconvex problems. Empirically, we validate these findings through extensive
experiments across convex, smooth nonconvex, and nonsmooth nonconvex
optimization tasks. Across all cases, high-order momentum consistently
outperforms conventional low-order momentum methods, showcasing superior
performance in various optimization problems.

Conclusion: 研究为随机化在优化中的广泛应用提供了理论和实证基础。

Abstract: While gradient-based optimizers that incorporate randomization often showcase
superior performance on complex optimization, the theoretical foundations
underlying this superiority remain insufficiently understood. A particularly
pressing question has emerged: What is the role of randomization in
dimension-free nonsmooth nonconvex optimization? To address this gap, we
investigate the theoretical and empirical impact of permutation randomization
within gradient-based optimization frameworks, using it as a representative
case to explore broader implications. From a theoretical perspective, our
analyses reveal that permutation randomization disrupts the shrinkage behavior
of gradient-based optimizers, facilitating continuous convergence toward the
global optimum given a sufficiently large number of iterations. Additionally,
we prove that permutation randomization can preserve the convergence rate of
the underlying optimizer. On the empirical side, we conduct extensive numerical
experiments comparing permutation-randomized optimizer against three baseline
methods. These experiments span tasks such as training deep neural networks
with stacked architectures and optimizing noisy objective functions. The
results not only corroborate our theoretical insights but also highlight the
practical benefits of permutation randomization. In summary, this work delivers
both rigorous theoretical justification and compelling empirical evidence for
the effectiveness of permutation randomization. Our findings and evidence lay a
foundation for extending analytics to encompass a wide array of randomization.

<details>

Motivation: 探究SAE在LLM中表现不佳的原因，发现特征对冲问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证特征对冲现象，并提出改进的matryoshka SAE变体。

Result: 特征对冲是SAE表现不佳的核心原因，改进方法有望提升性能。

Conclusion: 特征对冲是SAE的根本问题，但通过研究有望推动其发展，实现LLM的大规模解释。

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic
activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations
are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we
find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true
features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features,
the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying
monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true.
This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction
loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the
problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and
empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one
of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines.
Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved
variant of matryoshka SAEs. Our work shows there remain fundamental issues with
SAEs, but we are hopeful that that highlighting feature hedging will catalyze
future advances that allow SAEs to achieve their full potential of interpreting
LLMs at scale.

Motivation: 去中心化学习中，设备通过局部数据训练和邻居模型聚合传播知识，但现有算法在传播OOD知识时效果不佳。

Method: 分析OOD知识传播问题，提出拓扑感知的聚合策略。

Result: 拓扑感知策略将OOD数据准确性平均提升123%。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知策略能有效加速OOD知识传播，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Decentralized learning enables collaborative training of models across
naturally distributed data without centralized coordination or maintenance of a
global model. Instead, devices are organized in arbitrary communication
topologies, in which they can only communicate with neighboring devices. Each
device maintains its own local model by training on its local data and
integrating new knowledge via model aggregation with neighbors. Therefore,
knowledge is propagated across the topology via successive aggregation rounds.
We study, in particular, the propagation of out-of-distribution (OOD)
knowledge. We find that popular decentralized learning algorithms struggle to
propagate OOD knowledge effectively to all devices. Further, we find that both
the location of OOD data within a topology, and the topology itself,
significantly impact OOD knowledge propagation. We then propose topology-aware
aggregation strategies to accelerate (OOD) knowledge propagation across
devices. These strategies improve OOD data accuracy, compared to
topology-unaware baselines, by 123% on average across models in a topology.

Result: SKNO在实验中表现优于其他方法，并在基准测试和零样本超分辨率任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 重新定义的d+1维神经算子框架更符合系统演化，SKNO展示了其优越性和潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between
function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely
validated on universally approximating various operators. Although recent
advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to
better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$
dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3...$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the
embedding spaces blocks our view to design neural operators that can fully
capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on recent breakthroughs in quantum simulation of partial differential
equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution process in neural
operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$
dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement our proposed
Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$
dimensional evolution. In experiments, our $d+1$ dimensional evolving linear
block performs far better than others. Also, we test SKNO's SOTA performance on
various benchmark tests and also the zero-shot super-resolution task. In
addition, we analyse the impact of different lifting and recovering operators
on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment
between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

Result: 两种方法在分布内和分布外数据上均表现优异，AUC-ROC高，优于非因果方法。

Conclusion: 内部因果分析是预测语言模型行为的新且重要应用。

Abstract: Interpretability research now offers a variety of techniques for identifying
abstract internal mechanisms in neural networks. Can such techniques be used to
predict how models will behave on out-of-distribution examples? In this work,
we provide a positive answer to this question. Through a diverse set of
language modeling tasks--including symbol manipulation, knowledge retrieval,
and instruction following--we show that the most robust features for
correctness prediction are those that play a distinctive causal role in the
model's behavior. Specifically, we propose two methods that leverage causal
mechanisms to predict the correctness of model outputs: counterfactual
simulation (checking whether key causal variables are realized) and value
probing (using the values of those variables to make predictions). Both achieve
high AUC-ROC in distribution and outperform methods that rely on
causal-agnostic features in out-of-distribution settings, where predicting
model behaviors is more crucial. Our work thus highlights a novel and
significant application for internal causal analysis of language models.

Result: 理论证明REFINE可避免负迁移，实验显示其在视觉、文本和表格数据中表现优越。

Conclusion: REFINE是一种轻量、通用且稳健的迁移学习方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Transfer learning typically leverages representations learned from a source
domain to improve performance on a target task. A common approach is to extract
features from a pre-trained model and directly apply them for target
prediction. However, this strategy is prone to negative transfer where the
source representation fails to align with the target distribution. In this
article, we propose Residual Feature Integration (REFINE), a simple yet
effective method designed to mitigate negative transfer. Our approach combines
a fixed source-side representation with a trainable target-side encoder and
fits a shallow neural network on the resulting joint representation, which
adapts to the target domain while preserving transferable knowledge from the
source domain. Theoretically, we prove that REFINE is sufficient to prevent
negative transfer under mild conditions, and derive the generalization bound
demonstrating its theoretical benefit. Empirically, we show that REFINE
consistently enhances performance across diverse application and data
modalities including vision, text, and tabular data, and outperforms numerous
alternative solutions. Our method is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and
robust, making it a valuable addition to the existing transfer learning
toolbox.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LAMP} (\textbf{L}inear \textbf{A}ttribution
\textbf{M}apping \textbf{P}robe), a method that shines light onto a black-box
language model's decision surface and studies how reliably a model maps its
stated reasons to its predictions through a locally linear model approximating
the decision surface. LAMP treats the model's own self-reported explanations as
a coordinate system and fits a locally linear surrogate that links those
weights to the model's output. By doing so, it reveals which stated factors
steer the model's decisions, and by how much. We apply LAMP to three tasks:
\textit{sentiment analysis}, \textit{controversial-topic detection}, and
\textit{safety-prompt auditing}. Across these tasks, LAMP reveals that many
LLMs exhibit locally linear decision landscapes. In addition, these surfaces
correlate with human judgments on explanation quality and, on a clinical
case-file data set, aligns with expert assessments. Since LAMP operates without
requiring access to model gradients, logits, or internal activations, it serves
as a practical and lightweight framework for auditing proprietary language
models, and enabling assessment of whether a model behaves consistently with
the explanations it provides.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in mathematical
problem-solving, but evaluation has largely focused on problems that have exact
analytical solutions or involve formal proofs, often overlooking
approximation-based problems ubiquitous in applied science and engineering. To
fill this gap, we build on prior work and present HARDMath2, a dataset of 211
original problems covering the core topics in an introductory graduate applied
math class, including boundary-layer analysis, WKB methods, asymptotic
solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, and the asymptotics of
oscillatory integrals. This dataset was designed and verified by the students
and instructors of a core graduate applied mathematics course at Harvard. We
build the dataset through a novel collaborative environment that challenges
students to write and refine difficult problems consistent with the class
syllabus, peer-validate solutions, test different models, and automatically
check LLM-generated solutions against their own answers and numerical ground
truths. Evaluation results show that leading frontier models still struggle
with many of the problems in the dataset, highlighting a gap in the
mathematical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Importantly, students identified
strategies to create increasingly difficult problems by interacting with the
models and exploiting common failure modes. This back-and-forth with the models
not only resulted in a richer and more challenging benchmark but also led to
qualitative improvements in the students' understanding of the course material,
which is increasingly important as we enter an age where state-of-the-art
language models can solve many challenging problems across a wide domain of
fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和生成方法的图自监督学习架构，通过社区感知节点级对比学习和图级对比学习，结合多种增强策略，在节点分类、聚类和链接预测任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 解决现有图自监督学习方法中对比学习和生成方法各自优势无法结合的问题，提升在有限或无标签数据场景下的表现。

Method: 结合社区感知节点级对比学习和图级对比学习，采用特征掩码、节点扰动和边扰动等增强策略。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合对比学习和生成方法的优势，显著提升了图自监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph
representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such
as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is
particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL
methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each
excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on
classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction.
In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates
the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware
node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive
and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning
to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive
augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and
edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By
incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance
across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link
prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of
0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

*Ziyu Zhou,Jiaxi Hu,Qingsong Wen,James T. Kwok,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波导数变换（WDT）的多分支框架WaveTS，用于解决传统傅里叶变换和小波变换在时间序列预测中捕捉多尺度、时间敏感模式的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶变换和小波变换在捕捉时间序列中的多尺度、时间敏感模式时存在局限性，尤其是小波变换对时间变化点不敏感。

Method: 提出多阶小波导数变换（WDT），通过操作序列的导数来放大变化率线索，并结合多分支框架WaveTS进行多尺度时间-频率系数分解与重构。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，WaveTS实现了最先进的预测精度，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: WDT和WaveTS框架有效解决了传统方法的不足，为时间序列预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively
employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in
capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform
(WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its
coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to
suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the
multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the
extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle
fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series,
the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying
rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly
informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a
multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into
multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and
reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive
experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加权聚合预测集的方法，通过分配权重优化整体覆盖范围，介于1-2α和1-α之间，并扩展到数据依赖权重，保持有限样本有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂场景中，聚合多个预测集会削弱整体覆盖保证（通常降至1-2α），需要一种灵活的方法优化聚合效果。

Method: 提出加权聚合框架，分配权重以控制聚合方式，并扩展到数据依赖权重，确保有限样本有效性。

Result: 实验表明，数据依赖权重聚合提供自适应覆盖，优化了预测集的精度。

Conclusion: 加权聚合框架在保持有效性的同时，显著提升了预测集的覆盖范围和适应性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by
augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets, assuming
exchangeability. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or
data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a
prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving
precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual
$1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically
resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a
framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are
assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework
offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter
coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the
combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending
on the distribution of weights. We extend our framework to data-dependent
weights, and we derive a general procedure for data-dependent weight
aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic and real data in
the mixture-of-experts setting, and we show that aggregation with
data-dependent weights provides a form of adaptive coverage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为JULI的方法，通过操纵token对数概率，利用小型插件BiasNet，成功在仅知道top-5 token对数概率的黑盒设置下破解API调用的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有攻击方法揭示了安全对齐LLMs的漏洞，但它们通常需要访问模型权重或生成过程，而专有模型通过API调用不提供此类权限，因此难以攻破。

Method: 提出JULI方法，通过操纵token对数概率和BiasNet插件，仅依赖目标LLM的预测token对数概率进行破解。

Result: JULI在多个指标上优于现有SOTA方法，成功在黑盒设置下破解API调用的LLMs。

Conclusion: JULI是一种高效的黑盒破解方法，仅需top-5 token对数概率即可实现，为LLMs的安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained with safety alignment to prevent
generating malicious content. Although some attacks have highlighted
vulnerabilities in these safety-aligned LLMs, they typically have limitations,
such as necessitating access to the model weights or the generation process.
Since proprietary models through API-calling do not grant users such
permissions, these attacks find it challenging to compromise them. In this
paper, we propose Jailbreaking Using LLM Introspection (JULI), which jailbreaks
LLMs by manipulating the token log probabilities, using a tiny plug-in block,
BiasNet. JULI relies solely on the knowledge of the target LLM's predicted
token log probabilities. It can effectively jailbreak API-calling LLMs under a
black-box setting and knowing only top-$5$ token log probabilities. Our
approach demonstrates superior effectiveness, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: Diffmv是一个基于扩散的生成框架，用于解决EHR数据中随机缺失视图和视图懒惰问题，通过统一框架和重新加权策略提升多视图利用效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设EHR数据视图完整且模型能充分利用每个视图，但实践中随机缺失视图和视图懒惰限制了多视图利用的改进。

Method: 提出Diffmv框架，通过扩散-去噪统一多视图数据，并引入重新加权策略评估各视图优势。

Result: 在多个健康预测任务中表现优异，涵盖多视图和多模态场景。

Conclusion: Diffmv有效解决了EHR数据中的视图问题，显著提升了多视图利用效果。

Abstract: Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient
outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize
various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab
tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume
the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully
leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views
and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further
improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we
introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed
to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to
address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a
unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual
conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To
mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses
the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of
various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior
performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular
datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在蛋白质功能预测方面取得进展，但缺乏对功能机制和模型捕获生物知识的详细评估需求。

Method: 引入VenusX基准测试，包含三类任务和六种注释类型，评估多种模型（如预训练蛋白质语言模型、序列-结构混合方法等）。

Result: 基准测试提供了全面的性能评估，支持分布内和分布外场景的模型比较。

Conclusion: VenusX为未来研究提供了坚实基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Deep learning models have driven significant progress in predicting protein
function and interactions at the protein level. While these advancements have
been invaluable for many biological applications such as enzyme engineering and
function annotation, a more detailed perspective is essential for understanding
protein functional mechanisms and evaluating the biological knowledge captured
by models. To address this demand, we introduce VenusX, the first large-scale
benchmark for fine-grained functional annotation and function-based protein
pairing at the residue, fragment, and domain levels. VenusX comprises three
major task categories across six types of annotations, including residue-level
binary classification, fragment-level multi-class classification, and pairwise
functional similarity scoring for identifying critical active sites, binding
sites, conserved sites, motifs, domains, and epitopes. The benchmark features
over 878,000 samples curated from major open-source databases such as InterPro,
BioLiP, and SAbDab. By providing mixed-family and cross-family splits at three
sequence identity thresholds, our benchmark enables a comprehensive assessment
of model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.
For baseline evaluation, we assess a diverse set of popular and open-source
models, including pre-trained protein language models, sequence-structure
hybrids, structure-based methods, and alignment-based techniques. Their
performance is reported across all benchmark datasets and evaluation settings
using multiple metrics, offering a thorough comparison and a strong foundation
for future research. Code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 回合级信用分配策略有效提升了LLM在多轮复杂决策任务中的表现。

Abstract: This paper investigates approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Specifically, we focus on multi-turn tool-use scenarios, which can be naturally
modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing approaches often
train multi-turn LLM agents with trajectory-level advantage estimation in
bandit settings, they struggle with turn-level credit assignment across
multiple decision steps, limiting their performance on multi-turn reasoning
tasks. To address this, we introduce a fine-grained turn-level advantage
estimation strategy to enable more precise credit assignment in multi-turn
agent interactions. The strategy is general and can be incorporated into
various RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO).
Our experimental evaluation on multi-turn reasoning and search-based tool-use
tasks with GRPO implementations highlights the effectiveness of the MDP
framework and the turn-level credit assignment in advancing the multi-turn
reasoning capabilities of LLM agents in complex decision-making settings. Our
method achieves 100% success in tool execution and 50% accuracy in exact answer
matching, significantly outperforming baselines, which fail to invoke tools and
achieve only 20-30% exact match accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法在满足最小作用原理和稳定收敛方面存在不足，Var-RUOT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Var-RUOT将RUOT问题的最优必要条件融入搜索空间参数化和损失函数设计，仅需学习标量场即可求解。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实单细胞数据集上验证，Var-RUOT比现有算法具有更低的作用量和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: Var-RUOT是一种高效且稳定的解决方案，适用于高维动态系统恢复任务。

Abstract: Recovering the dynamics from a few snapshots of a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task in statistical physics and machine learning, with important
applications in computational biology. Many algorithms have been developed to
tackle this problem, based on frameworks such as optimal transport and the
Schr\"odinger bridge. A notable recent framework is Regularized Unbalanced
Optimal Transport (RUOT), which integrates both stochastic dynamics and
unnormalized distributions. However, since many existing methods do not
explicitly enforce optimality conditions, their solutions often struggle to
satisfy the principle of least action and meet challenges to converge in a
stable and reliable way. To address these issues, we propose Variational RUOT
(Var-RUOT), a new framework to solve the RUOT problem. By incorporating the
optimal necessary conditions for the RUOT problem into both the
parameterization of the search space and the loss function design, Var-RUOT
only needs to learn a scalar field to solve the RUOT problem and can search for
solutions with lower action. We also examined the challenge of selecting a
growth penalty function in the widely used Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric and
proposed a solution that better aligns with biological priors in Var-RUOT. We
validated the effectiveness of Var-RUOT on both simulated data and real
single-cell datasets. Compared with existing algorithms, Var-RUOT can find
solutions with lower action while exhibiting faster convergence and improved
training stability.

Result: Search Corrector在逻辑和数学推理基准测试中有效识别错误，Amortized Corrector零样本准确率提升达25%。

Conclusion: 自校正框架显著提升了语言模型推理的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and
transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain
inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address
this, we introduce a new self-correction framework that augments each reasoning
step in a CoT with a latent variable indicating its veracity, enabling modeling
of all possible truth assignments rather than assuming correctness throughout.
To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Search Corrector, a
discrete search algorithm over boolean-valued veracity assignments. It
efficiently performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior
distribution over veracity assignments by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood
over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient
inference-time correction method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an
Amortized Corrector by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. The Amortized
Corrector generalizes self-correction, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity
inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that Search
Corrector reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA) and mathematical
reasoning (GSM8K) benchmarks. The Amortized Corrector achieves comparable
zero-shot accuracy and improves final answer accuracy by up to 25%.

Result: SAEs在准确性和可解释性之间存在权衡，PAM-SGD在样本效率和稀疏性上表现优异。

Conclusion: SAEs的理论框架和PAM-SGD算法为稀疏自编码器的研究和应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have received considerable recent attention as
tools for mechanistic interpretability, showing success at extracting
interpretable features even from very large LLMs. However, this research has
been largely empirical, and there have been recent doubts about the true
utility of SAEs. In this work, we seek to enhance the theoretical understanding
of SAEs, using the spline theory of deep learning. By situating SAEs in this
framework: we discover that SAEs generalise ``$k$-means autoencoders'' to be
piecewise affine, but sacrifice accuracy for interpretability vs. the optimal
``$k$-means-esque plus local principal component analysis (PCA)'' piecewise
affine autoencoder. We characterise the underlying geometry of (TopK) SAEs
using power diagrams. And we develop a novel proximal alternating method SGD
(PAM-SGD) algorithm for training SAEs, with both solid theoretical foundations
and promising empirical results in MNIST and LLM experiments, particularly in
sample efficiency and (in the LLM setting) improved sparsity of codes. All code

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含敏感信息，隐私攻击（如MIA）可能泄露这些信息。知识蒸馏对隐私保护的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过实验比较教师模型和学生模型在MIA中的表现，并提出五种隐私保护蒸馏方法。

Result: 教师模型更保护成员数据，学生模型更保护非成员数据。提出的五种方法成功降低了学生模型对MIA的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏中隐私保护方法可增强学生模型的安全性，为高效且安全的模型压缩提供了可靠途径。

Abstract: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on huge datasets, some
including sensitive information. This poses a serious privacy concern because
privacy attacks such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) may detect this
sensitive information. While knowledge distillation compresses LLMs into
efficient, smaller student models, its impact on privacy remains underexplored.
In this paper, we investigate how knowledge distillation affects model
robustness against MIA. We focus on two questions. First, how is private data
protected in teacher and student models? Second, how can we strengthen privacy
preservation against MIAs in knowledge distillation? Through comprehensive
experiments, we show that while teacher and student models achieve similar
overall MIA accuracy, teacher models better protect member data, the primary
target of MIA, whereas student models better protect non-member data. To
address this vulnerability in student models, we propose 5 privacy-preserving
distillation methods and demonstrate that they successfully reduce student
models' vulnerability to MIA, with ensembling further stabilizing the
robustness, offering a reliable approach for distilling more secure and
efficient student models. Our implementation source code is available at

Motivation: AdamW在训练大型语言模型中表现出色，但其收敛行为缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论推导和实验验证，分析了AdamW的收敛速率，并与SGD的最优速率进行比较。

Result: 理论推导和实验结果表明，AdamW的收敛速率与SGD的最优速率类似。

Conclusion: AdamW的收敛行为在理论上得到了支持，其性能与SGD相当。

Abstract: As the default optimizer for training large language models, AdamW has
achieved remarkable success in deep learning. However, its convergence behavior
is not theoretically well-understood. This paper establishes the convergence
rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_1\right]\leq
O(\frac{\sqrt{d}C}{K^{1/4}})$ for AdamW measured by $\ell_1$ norm, where $K$
represents the iteration number, $d$ denotes the model dimension, and $C$
matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we
have $E\left[\|\nabla f(x)\|_1\right]\geq\sqrt{\frac{2d}{\pi}}E\left[\|\nabla
f(x)\|_2\right]$ when each element of $\nabla f(x)$ is generated from Gaussian
distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. Empirically, our experimental results on
real-world deep learning tasks reveal $\|\nabla
f(x)\|_1=\varTheta(\sqrt{d})\|\nabla f(x)\|_2$. Both support that our
convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal
$\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(x^k)\|_2\right]\leq
O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often infer sparse representations, converging to a
subnetwork during the learning process. In this work, we theoretically analyze
subnetworks and their bias through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider
fully-connected networks with polynomial activation functions, and focus on the
geometry of the function space they parametrize, often referred to as
neuromanifold. First, we compute the dimension of the subspace of the
neuromanifold parametrized by subnetworks. Second, we show that this subspace
is singular. Third, we argue that such singularities often correspond to
critical points of the training dynamics. Lastly, we discuss convolutional
networks, for which subnetworks and singularities are similarly related, but
the bias does not arise.

Motivation: 数字孪生在预测分析中具有强大潜力，但现实差距（如上下文不匹配）影响其可靠性。现有方法缺乏持续校准和物理一致性保障。

Result: 在匹兹堡钢桁架桥的结构健康监测案例中，RGA模块实现了更快的校准和更好的现实对齐。

Conclusion: RGA模块通过持续校准和物理一致性约束，有效缩小了数字孪生的现实差距。

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) enable powerful predictive analytics, but persistent
discrepancies between simulations and real systems--known as the reality
gap--undermine their reliability. Coined in robotics, the term now applies to
DTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain
interactions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is
pressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational
context, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage:
simulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios
difficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model
alignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in
robotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike
one-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's
lifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of
out-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs
often perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from
observations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain
purely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some
approaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation
techniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality
Gap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data,
detects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our
approach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator
guidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency. We
illustrate the RGA module in a structural health monitoring case study on a
steel truss bridge in Pittsburgh, PA, showing faster calibration and better
real-world alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统强化学习在可扩展性上的挑战，探索量子计算在RL中的潜力。

Method: 通过量子叠加编码价值函数，利用量子并行性同时评估多个状态-动作对，并引入量子增强的策略迭代算法。

Result: 在小规模离散控制任务中验证了技术可行性和理论正确性，展示了概念验证行为。

Conclusion: Q-Policy为未来量子设备上的可扩展RL提供了理论基础，具有超越经典方法的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Q-Policy, a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that mathematically accelerates policy evaluation and optimization by
exploiting quantum computing primitives. Q-Policy encodes value functions in
quantum superposition, enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiple
state-action pairs via amplitude encoding and quantum parallelism. We introduce
a quantum-enhanced policy iteration algorithm with provable polynomial
reductions in sample complexity for the evaluation step, under standard
assumptions. To demonstrate the technical feasibility and theoretical soundness
of our approach, we validate Q-Policy on classical emulations of small discrete
control tasks. Due to current hardware and simulation limitations, our
experiments focus on showcasing proof-of-concept behavior rather than
large-scale empirical evaluation. Our results support the potential of Q-Policy
as a theoretical foundation for scalable RL on future quantum devices,
addressing RL scalability challenges beyond classical approaches.

Result: 建立了恢复帕累托前沿的样本复杂度界限，并提出了用于策略优化的收敛算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为高维和多元价值环境中的对齐行为学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly capable, alignment of their behavior
with complex human values remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often simplify human intent through reduction to a scalar reward, overlooking
the multi-faceted nature of human feedback. In this work, we introduce a
theoretical framework for preference-based Multi-Objective Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL), where human preferences are modeled as latent
vector-valued reward functions. We formalize the problem of recovering a
Pareto-optimal reward representation from noisy preference queries and
establish conditions for identifying the underlying multi-objective structure.
We derive tight sample complexity bounds for recovering
$\epsilon$-approximations of the Pareto front and introduce a regret
formulation to quantify suboptimality in this multi-objective setting.
Furthermore, we propose a provably convergent algorithm for policy optimization
using preference-inferred reward cones. Our results bridge the gap between
practical alignment techniques and theoretical guarantees, providing a
principled foundation for learning aligned behaviors in a high-dimension and
value-pluralistic environment.

Result: J1-7B超越现有最佳LLM-as-a-Judge模型4.8%，在STTS下扩展趋势强5.1%。

Conclusion: 强化学习是实现有效测试时扩展的关键，反射增强数据集单独微调效果有限。

Abstract: The current focus of AI research is shifting from emphasizing model training
towards enhancing evaluation quality, a transition that is crucial for driving
further advancements in AI systems. Traditional evaluation methods typically
rely on reward models assigning scalar preference scores to outputs. Although
effective, such approaches lack interpretability, leaving users often uncertain
about why a reward model rates a particular response as high or low. The advent
of LLM-as-a-Judge provides a more scalable and interpretable method of
supervision, offering insights into the decision-making process. Moreover, with
the emergence of large reasoning models, which consume more tokens for deeper
thinking and answer refinement, scaling test-time computation in the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm presents an avenue for further boosting performance and
providing more interpretability through reasoning traces. In this paper, we
introduce $\textbf{J1-7B}$, which is first supervised fine-tuned on
reflection-enhanced datasets collected via rejection-sampling and subsequently
trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with verifiable rewards. At inference
time, we apply Simple Test-Time Scaling (STTS) strategies for additional
performance improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that $\textbf{J1-7B}$
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art LLM-as-a-Judge by $ \textbf{4.8}$\% and
exhibits a $ \textbf{5.1}$\% stronger scaling trend under STTS. Additionally,
we present three key findings: (1) Existing LLM-as-a-Judge does not inherently
exhibit such scaling trend. (2) Model simply fine-tuned on reflection-enhanced
datasets continues to demonstrate similarly weak scaling behavior. (3)
Significant scaling trend emerges primarily during the RL phase, suggesting
that effective STTS capability is acquired predominantly through RL training.

Motivation: 分子属性预测在药物开发中至关重要，但实验数据稀缺限制了AI模型的性能。

Result: 在5-shot和10-shot设置下，AdaptMol在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 多模态自适应融合能高效表示分子，且两种模态的融合对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction (MPP) is a critical step in modern
drug development. However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a
significant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning
scenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the
theoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a
prototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular
representation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to
dynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two
modalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level,
structural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted
from molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At
the global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the
molecule. To validate the necessity of multimodal adaptive fusion, we propose
an interpretable approach based on identifying molecular active substructures
to demonstrate that multimodal adaptive fusion can efficiently represent
molecules. Extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmarks under 5-shot
and 10-shot settings demonstrate that AdaptMol achieves state-of-the-art
performance in most cases. The rationale-extracted method guides the fusion of
two modalities and highlights the importance of both modalities.

Motivation: 解决持续模型合并中的参数干扰和测试分布适应性问题。

Method: 采用混合专家架构和空门约束门控，结合自适应松弛策略动态调整合并过程。

Result: MINGLE显著减少遗忘，平均性能提升7-9%。

Conclusion: MINGLE在持续模型合并中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models
sequentially without access to original training data, providing a scalable and
efficient solution to continual learning. However, current methods still face
critical challenges, notably parameter interference among tasks and limited
adaptability to evolving test distributions. The former causes catastrophic
forgetting of integrated tasks, while the latter hinders effective adaptation
to new tasks. To address these, we propose MINGLE, a novel framework for
test-time continual model merging, which leverages test-time adaptation using a
small set of unlabeled test samples from the current task to dynamically guide
the merging process. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture composed
of parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, enabling efficient adaptation and
improving robustness to distribution shifts. To mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating
updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations. This suppresses
activations on old task inputs and preserves model behavior on past tasks. To
further balance stability and adaptability, we design an Adaptive Relaxation
Strategy, which dynamically adjusts the constraint strength based on
interference signals captured during test-time adaptation. Extensive
experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE
achieves robust generalization, reduces forgetting significantly, and
consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average
across diverse task orders.

Motivation: RoPE位置嵌入虽然有效，但增加了注意力计算的复杂性，使得之前的快速算法不再适用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合多项式方法和快速傅里叶变换，设计了一种新的算法。

Result: 在有限输入范围内，实现了RoPE注意力的几乎线性时间计算。

Conclusion: 新算法成功克服了RoPE带来的计算复杂性，同时证明了有限输入范围的必要性。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has been widely applied to many machine learning
tasks. A main bottleneck in the time to perform transformer computations is a
task called attention computation. [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] have shown
that in the bounded entry regime, there is an almost linear time algorithm to
approximate the attention computation. They also proved that the bounded entry
assumption is necessary for a fast algorithm assuming the popular Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  A new version of transformer which uses position embeddings has recently been
very successful. At a high level, position embedding enables the model to
capture the correlations between tokens while taking into account their
position in the sequence. Perhaps the most popular and effective version is
Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which was proposed by [Su, Lu, Pan, Murtadha,
Wen, and Liu, Neurocomputing 2024].
  A main downside of RoPE is that it complicates the attention computation
problem, so that previous techniques for designing almost linear time
algorithms no longer seem to work. In this paper, we show how to overcome this
issue, and give a new algorithm to compute the RoPE attention in almost linear
time in the bounded entry regime. (Again, known lower bounds imply that bounded
entries are necessary.) Our new algorithm combines two techniques in a novel
way: the polynomial method, which was used in prior fast attention algorithms,
and the Fast Fourier Transform.

TL;DR: AdaCoT是一种自适应链式思维（CoT）框架，通过强化学习动态决定何时触发CoT，以平衡性能和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CoT提示在简单查询中生成冗长推理步骤导致的计算成本高和效率低的问题。

Method: 提出AdaCoT框架，将自适应推理建模为帕累托优化问题，使用PPO强化学习调整惩罚系数，并结合选择性损失掩码（SLM）防止决策边界崩溃。

Result: AdaCoT显著降低了CoT触发率（低至3.18%）和响应令牌数（减少69.06%），同时保持复杂任务的高性能。

Conclusion: AdaCoT有效平衡了推理性能和计算效率，适用于实际生产环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
often face challenges with tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it
indiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to
substantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler
inputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive
Chain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to
invoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem
that seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT
invocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a
reinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision
boundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to
determine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical
contribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision
boundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable
adaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully
navigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage
for queries not requiring elaborate reasoning. For instance, on our production
traffic testset, AdaCoT reduced CoT triggering rates to as low as 3.18\% and
decreased average response tokens by 69.06%, while maintaining high performance
on complex tasks.

Result: 理论证明该方法功能表达能力高于静态模型和LoRA，实验显示在复杂冲突任务环境中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 动态扰动自适应方法在快速适应和渐进学习方面表现优异，适用于多变任务环境。

Abstract: We formulate time series tasks as input-output mappings under varying
objectives, where the same input may yield different outputs. This challenges a
model's generalization and adaptability. To study this, we construct a
synthetic dataset with numerous conflicting subtasks to evaluate adaptation
under frequent task shifts. Existing static models consistently fail in such
settings. We propose a dynamic perturbed adaptive method based on a
trunk-branch architecture, where the trunk evolves slowly to capture long-term
structure, and branch modules are re-initialized and updated for each task.
This enables continual test-time adaptation and cross-task transfer without
relying on explicit task labels. Theoretically, we show that this architecture
has strictly higher functional expressivity than static models and LoRA. We
also establish exponential convergence of branch adaptation under the
Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex and conflicting task
environments, exhibiting fast adaptation and progressive learning capabilities.

Conclusion: k*-means是一种高效且无需参数设置的聚类算法。

Abstract: Clustering is a widely used and powerful machine learning technique, but its
effectiveness is often limited by the need to specify the number of clusters,
k, or by relying on thresholds that implicitly determine k. We introduce
k*-means, a novel clustering algorithm that eliminates the need to set k or any
other parameters. Instead, it uses the minimum description length principle to
automatically determine the optimal number of clusters, k*, by splitting and
merging clusters while also optimising the standard k-means objective. We prove
that k*-means is guaranteed to converge and demonstrate experimentally that it
significantly outperforms existing methods in scenarios where k is unknown. We
also show that it is accurate in estimating k, and that empirically its runtime
is competitive with existing methods, and scales well with dataset size.

Abstract: Multi-agent simulations enables the modeling and analyses of the dynamic
behaviors and interactions of autonomous entities evolving in complex
environments. Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent
phenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational
cost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations
requiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty
quantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for
real-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these
limitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning
approximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide
cheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while
maintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression
models, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been
applied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification
and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and
interpretability.
  This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate
modeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational
efficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model,
we highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate
models, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance.
Finally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within
ABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support
across various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
modern artificial intelligence, among which the capability of implicitly
learning an internal model during inference time is widely believed to play a
key role in the under standing of pre-trained large language models. However,
most recent works have been focusing on studying supervised learning topics
such as in-context learning, leaving the field of unsupervised learning largely
unexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of transformers in solving
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), a fundamental unsupervised learning problem
through the lens of statistical estimation. We propose a transformer-based
learning framework called TGMM that simultaneously learns to solve multiple GMM
tasks using a shared transformer backbone. The learned models are empirically
demonstrated to effectively mitigate the limitations of classical methods such
as Expectation-Maximization (EM) or spectral algorithms, at the same time
exhibit reasonable robustness to distribution shifts. Theoretically, we prove
that transformers can approximate both the EM algorithm and a core component of
spectral methods (cubic tensor power iterations). These results bridge the gap
between practical success and theoretical understanding, positioning
transformers as versatile tools for unsupervised learning.

34,000 individual screw driving operations conducted under controlled

specific aspects: natural thread degradation patterns through repeated use
(s01), variations in surface friction conditions including contamination and
surface treatments (s02), diverse assembly faults with up to 27 error types
(s03-s04), and fabrication parameter variations in both upper and lower
workpieces through modified injection molding settings (s05-s06). We detail the
standardized experimental setup used across all datasets, including hardware

serve diverse research applications including anomaly detection, predictive
maintenance, quality control system development, feature extraction methodology

Result: 递归应用静态GNNs的时序GNNs能捕获PTL和K乘积逻辑的所有性质，而其他架构（如graph-and-time TGNNs）只能表达受限片段。

Conclusion: 首次为时序GNNs提供了逻辑表征，并确立了其相对表达能力的新结果。

Abstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures --
including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural
networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language
theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well
understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple
architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to
analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial
(graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper,
we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by
connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive
power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are
combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over
time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past)
propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast,
architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express
restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and
spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These results yield the first
logical characterisations of temporal GNNs and establish new relative
expressiveness results for temporal GNNs.

Conclusion: CCD框架通过一致性标准有效解决了扩散模型在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，为持续生成任务提供了理论支持和实践方法。

Abstract: While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in static data
generation, their deployment in streaming or continual learning (CL) scenarios
faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting (CF), where newly acquired
generative capabilities overwrite previously learned ones. To systematically
address this, we introduce a formal Continual Diffusion Generation (CDG)
paradigm that characterizes and redefines CL in the context of generative
diffusion models. Prior efforts often adapt heuristic strategies from continual
classification tasks but lack alignment with the underlying diffusion process.
In this work, we develop the first theoretical framework for CDG by analyzing
cross-task dynamics in diffusion-based generative modeling. Our analysis
reveals that the retention and stability of generative knowledge across tasks
are governed by three key consistency criteria: inter-task knowledge
consistency (IKC), unconditional knowledge consistency (UKC), and label
knowledge consistency (LKC). Building on these insights, we propose Continual
Consistency Diffusion (CCD), a principled framework that integrates these
consistency objectives into training via hierarchical loss terms
$\mathcal{L}_{IKC}$, $\mathcal{L}_{UKC}$, and $\mathcal{L}_{LKC}$. This
promotes effective knowledge retention while enabling the assimilation of new
generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate that CCD achieves state-of-the-art performance under continual
settings, with substantial gains in Mean Fidelity (MF) and Incremental Mean
Fidelity (IMF), particularly in tasks with rich cross-task knowledge overlap.

Abstract: Loss reweighting has shown significant benefits for machine unlearning with
large language models (LLMs). However, their exact functionalities are left
unclear and the optimal strategy remains an open question, thus impeding the
understanding and improvement of existing methodologies. In this paper, we
identify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and
Importance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data
should be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are
most influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design
specific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective
effects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on
well-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as
follows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based
reweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii)
Saturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods,
whereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of
unlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the
weight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple
reweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and
importance. Empirical results on extensive datasets validate the efficacy of
our method, potentially bridging existing research gaps and indicating
directions for future research. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文研究了Bulk-SGD（一种限制更新在Hessian主导子空间正交补上的SGD变体），发现其在平坦方向上加速收敛但可能影响稳定性，并提出插值梯度方法以平衡效果。


<details>

Motivation: 探索Hessian谱中尖锐和平坦方向的不同作用，以及梯度与Hessian主导子空间的对齐现象。

Method: 通过Bulk-SGD的消融研究分析其稳定性，并引入插值梯度方法统一SGD、Dom-SGD和Bulk-SGD。

Result: 发现曲率能量主要集中在主导子空间，平坦方向更新可加速收敛但可能降低稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于曲率感知的优化器设计原则。

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted a surprising alignment between gradients and the
top eigenspace of the Hessian -- termed the Dominant subspace -- during neural
network training. Concurrently, there has been growing interest in the distinct
roles of sharp and flat directions in the Hessian spectrum. In this work, we
study Bulk-SGD, a variant of SGD that restricts updates to the orthogonal
complement of the Dominant subspace. Through ablation studies, we characterize
the stability properties of Bulk-SGD and identify critical hyperparameters that
govern its behavior. We show that updates along the Bulk subspace,
corresponding to flatter directions in the loss landscape, can accelerate
convergence but may compromise stability. To balance these effects, we
introduce interpolated gradient methods that unify SGD, Dom-SGD, and Bulk-SGD.
Finally, we empirically connect this subspace decomposition to the Generalized
Gauss-Newton and Functional Hessian terms, showing that curvature energy is
largely concentrated in the Dominant subspace. Our findings suggest a
principled approach to designing curvature-aware optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在保护数据隐私的同时效率较低，现有量化方法仅关注速度或准确性，缺乏综合考虑。

Method: 提出混合量化方法FedHQ，结合PTQ和QAT，通过硬件和数据分布分析优化策略选择，并采用粗粒度初始化和细粒度ML调整。

Result: FedHQ实现了2.47倍训练加速和11.15%精度提升，额外开销可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHQ为FL提供了一种高效且准确的混合量化解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized model training approach that
preserves data privacy but struggles with low efficiency. Quantization, a
powerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for
integration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct
performance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as
post-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a
result, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT,
optimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently
accelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL
settings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and
QAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of
using hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and
accuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related
analysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off
boundaries for strategy selection. Based on these, we proposed a novel
framework named FedHQ to automatically adopt optimal hybrid strategy allocation
for FL systems. Specifically, FedHQ develops a coarse-grained global
initialization and fine-grained ML-based adjustment to ensure efficiency and
robustness. Experiments show that FedHQ achieves up to 2.47x times training
acceleration and up to 11.15% accuracy improvement and negligible extra
overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效选择方差最大的臂，以优化多臂老虎机问题中的性能。

Method: 开发UCB-VV算法（遗憾设置）和SHVV算法（固定预算设置），并扩展到次高斯分布。

Result: UCB-VV的遗憾上界为O(log n)，SHVV的错误概率上界为exp(-n/log(K)H)，均达到理论最优。

Conclusion: UCB-VV和SHVV在理论和实验中均表现优异，适用于金融等实际场景。

Abstract: This paper focuses on selecting the arm with the highest variance from a set
of $K$ independent arms. Specifically, we focus on two settings: (i) regret
setting, that penalizes the number of pulls of suboptimal arms in terms of
variance, and (ii) fixed-budget \ac{BAI} setting, that evaluates the ability of
an algorithm to determine the arm with the highest variance after a fixed
number of pulls. We develop a novel online algorithm called \texttt{UCB-VV} for
the regret setting and show that its upper bound on regret for bounded rewards
evolves as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log{n}\right)$ where $n$ is the horizon. By
deriving the lower bound on the regret, we show that \texttt{UCB-VV} is order
optimal. For the fixed budget \ac{BAI} setting and propose the \texttt{SHVV}
algorithm. We show that the upper bound of the error probability of
\texttt{SHVV} evolves as $\exp\left(-\frac{n}{\log(K) H}\right)$, where $H$
represents the complexity of the problem, and this rate matches the
corresponding lower bound. We extend the framework from bounded distributions
to sub-Gaussian distributions using a novel concentration inequality on the
sample variance. Leveraging the same, we derive a concentration inequality for
the empirical Sharpe ratio (SR) for sub-Gaussian distributions, which was
previously unknown in the literature. Empirical simulations show that
\texttt{UCB-VV} consistently outperforms \texttt{$\epsilon$-greedy} across
different sub-optimality gaps though it is surpassed by \texttt{VTS}, which
exhibits the lowest regret, albeit lacking in theoretical guarantees. We also
illustrate the superior performance of \texttt{SHVV}, for a fixed budget
setting under 6 different setups against uniform sampling. Finally, we conduct
a case study to empirically evaluate the performance of the \texttt{UCB-VV} and
\texttt{SHVV} in call option trading on $100$ stocks generated using \ac{GBM}.

Motivation: 灾难性遗忘是持续学习中的关键挑战，现有参数高效微调方法对秩选择敏感，导致性能不佳。

Method: PEARL通过动态分配LoRA组件的秩，基于当前任务与参考任务权重的接近程度自适应调整。

Result: 在三种视觉架构和多种持续学习场景中，PEARL显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PEARL提供了一种高效且灵活的持续学习解决方案，解决了秩选择敏感性问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting has remained a critical challenge for deep neural
networks in Continual Learning (CL) as it undermines consolidated knowledge
when learning new tasks. Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are
gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting
with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated
knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these
approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal
resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a
rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA
components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task
weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components
based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter
space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three
vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision
Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms
all considered baselines by a large margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 1-Lipschitz神经网络在生成建模、逆问题和鲁棒分类器中至关重要，但缺乏对其逼近能力的严格理论支持。

Method: 利用限制Stone-Weierstrass定理，分析1-Lipschitz ResNets的逼近能力，并通过插入范数约束线性映射扩展结果。

Result: 证明了1-Lipschitz ResNets在宽度和深度增加时的稠密性，以及在固定宽度下的类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文首次为1-Lipschitz ResNets提供了通用逼近保证，为其实际应用奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: 1-Lipschitz neural networks are fundamental for generative modelling, inverse
problems, and robust classifiers. In this paper, we focus on 1-Lipschitz
residual networks (ResNets) based on explicit Euler steps of negative gradient
flows and study their approximation capabilities. Leveraging the Restricted
Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, we first show that these 1-Lipschitz ResNets are
dense in the set of scalar 1-Lipschitz functions on any compact domain when
width and depth are allowed to grow. We also show that these networks can
exactly represent scalar piecewise affine 1-Lipschitz functions. We then prove
a stronger statement: by inserting norm-constrained linear maps between the
residual blocks, the same density holds when the hidden width is fixed. Because
every layer obeys simple norm constraints, the resulting models can be trained
with off-the-shelf optimisers. This paper provides the first universal
approximation guarantees for 1-Lipschitz ResNets, laying a rigorous foundation
for their practical use.

Result: 在多个PDE基准测试中，GeoMaNO将解算子逼近性能提升高达58.9%。

Conclusion: GeoMaNO框架为PDE求解提供了一种高效且几何严谨的新方法。

Abstract: The neural operator (NO) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent NOs are dominated by the
Transformer architecture, which offers NOs the capability to capture long-range
dependencies in PDE dynamics. However, existing Transformer-based NOs suffer
from quadratic complexity, lack geometric rigor, and thus suffer from
sub-optimal performance on regular grids. As a remedy, we propose the Geometric
Mamba Neural Operator (GeoMaNO) framework, which empowers NOs with Mamba's
modeling capability, linear complexity, plus geometric rigor. We evaluate
GeoMaNO's performance on multiple standard and popularly employed PDE
benchmarks, spanning from Darcy flow problems to Navier-Stokes problems.
GeoMaNO improves existing baselines in solution operator approximation by as
much as 58.9%.

Result: 在多种任务和不同规模模型上验证了方法的有效性，提升了指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能动态适应用户意图，显著提升模型对指令的遵循能力，且不影响性能。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, users rely on natural language instructions
to guide large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. These
instructions are often complex, diverse, and subject to frequent change.
However, LLMs do not always attend to these instructions reliably, and users
lack simple mechanisms to emphasize their importance beyond modifying prompt
wording or structure. To address this, we present an inference-time method that
enables users to emphasize specific parts of their prompt by steering the
model's attention toward them, aligning the model's perceived importance of
different prompt tokens with user intent. Unlike prior approaches that are
limited to static instructions, require significant offline profiling, or rely
on fixed biases, we dynamically update the proportion of model attention given
to the user-specified parts--ensuring improved instruction following without
performance degradation. We demonstrate that our approach improves instruction
following across a variety of tasks involving multiple instructions and
generalizes across models of varying scales.

Result: REEF在预训练和迁移学习任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: REEF展示了作为图基础模型的强大潜力，能够有效泛化到不同数据集。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
generalization capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising
direction in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets
through large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on
explicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for
generalization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training
strategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages
relation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary
in LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store
relational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we
introduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of
aggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens.
In addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific
projectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node
representations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same
relation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset
pre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more
effectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Extensive
experiments show that REEF significantly outperforms existing methods on both
pre-training and transfer learning tasks, underscoring its potential as a
powerful foundation model for graph-based applications.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) problems are fundamental in online
decision-making and have been instrumental in finding an optimal policy for
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Function approximations are usually deployed
to handle large or infinite state-action space. In our work, we consider the RL
problems with function approximation and we develop a new algorithm to solve it
efficiently. Our algorithm is based on the linear programming (LP)
reformulation and it resolves the LP at each iteration improved with new data
arrival. Such a resolving scheme enables our algorithm to achieve an
instance-dependent sample complexity guarantee, more precisely, when we have
$N$ data, the output of our algorithm enjoys an instance-dependent
$\tilde{O}(1/N)$ suboptimality gap. In comparison to the $O(1/\sqrt{N})$
worst-case guarantee established in the previous literature, our
instance-dependent guarantee is tighter when the underlying instance is
favorable, and the numerical experiments also reveal the efficient empirical
performances of our algorithms.

Result: 在四个多样化数据集上的实验表明，Safe Delta能有效保持安全性且不影响实用性。

Conclusion: Safe Delta是一种有效的后训练防御方法，适用于多样化的微调场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential as general-purpose AI
assistants across various domains. To fully leverage this potential in specific
applications, many companies provide fine-tuning API services, enabling users
to upload their own data for LLM customization. However, fine-tuning services
introduce a new safety threat: user-uploaded data, whether harmful or benign,
can break the model's alignment, leading to unsafe outputs. Moreover, existing
defense methods struggle to address the diversity of fine-tuning datasets
(e.g., varying sizes, tasks), often sacrificing utility for safety or vice
versa. To address this issue, we propose Safe Delta, a safety-aware
post-training defense method that adjusts the delta parameters (i.e., the
parameter change before and after fine-tuning). Specifically, Safe Delta
estimates the safety degradation, selects delta parameters to maximize utility
while limiting overall safety loss, and applies a safety compensation vector to
mitigate residual safety loss. Through extensive experiments on four diverse
datasets with varying settings, our approach consistently preserves safety
while ensuring that the utility gain from benign datasets remains unaffected.

Result: 在AlphaFold中实现1.5倍加速，视觉和语言模型中实现2倍以上加速，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: FlashBias为带偏置的注意力机制提供了高效且精确的计算方案，推动了其广泛应用。

Abstract: Attention mechanism has emerged as a foundation module of modern deep
learning models and has also empowered many milestones in various domains.
Moreover, FlashAttention with IO-aware speedup resolves the efficiency issue of
standard attention, further promoting its practicality. Beyond canonical
attention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position
bias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold.
In these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of
attention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven
essential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of
attention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent,
which seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the
computation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is
determined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this
theoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank
compressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many
widely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in
general formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely
optimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\times$
speedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\times$ speedup for attention with bias in
vision and language models without loss of accuracy.

Result: 模型在多样港口环境中表现优异，Bhattacharyya距离均值0.85，优于现有方法的13.56。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精确识别泊位边界，提升港口运营监测和优化能力。

Abstract: Port berthing sites are regions of high interest for monitoring and
optimizing port operations. Data sourced from the Automatic Identification
System (AIS) can be superimposed on berths enabling their real-time monitoring
and revealing long-term utilization patterns. Ultimately, insights from
multiple berths can uncover bottlenecks, and lead to the optimization of the
underlying supply chain of the port and beyond. However, publicly available
documentation of port berths, even when available, is frequently incomplete -
e.g. there may be missing berths or inaccuracies such as incorrect boundary
boxes - necessitating a more robust, data-driven approach to port berth
localization. In this context, we propose an unsupervised spatial modeling
method that leverages AIS data clustering and hyperparameter optimization to
identify berthing sites. Trained on one month of freely available AIS data and
evaluated across ports of varying sizes, our models significantly outperform
competing methods, achieving a mean Bhattacharyya distance of 0.85 when
comparing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) trained on separate data splits,
compared to 13.56 for the best existing method. Qualitative comparison with
satellite images and existing berth labels further supports the superiority of
our method, revealing more precise berth boundaries and improved spatial
resolution across diverse port environments.

Motivation: 研究在多目标马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）中，标量奖励无法表示偏好的情况，扩展Hausner的理论。

Method: 通过放松连续性公理，提出偏好无法用标量奖励表示的条件，并刻画2维及d维奖励函数。

Result: 在MDP中，多维奖励函数的最优策略保留了标量奖励的许多优良性质，但在CMDP中则不然。

Conclusion: 多维奖励函数在MDP中具有实用性，但在CMDP中表现不佳。

Abstract: Recent work has formalized the reward hypothesis through the lens of expected
utility theory, by interpreting reward as utility. Hausner's foundational work
showed that dropping the continuity axiom leads to a generalization of expected
utility theory where utilities are lexicographically ordered vectors of
arbitrary dimension. In this paper, we extend this result by identifying a
simple and practical condition under which preferences cannot be represented by
scalar rewards, necessitating a 2-dimensional reward function. We provide a
full characterization of such reward functions, as well as the general
d-dimensional case, in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) under a memorylessness
assumption on preferences. Furthermore, we show that optimal policies in this
setting retain many desirable properties of their scalar-reward counterparts,
while in the Constrained MDP (CMDP) setting -- another common multiobjective
setting -- they do not.

Abstract: Discovering symbolic differential equations from data uncovers fundamental
dynamical laws underlying complex systems. However, existing methods often
struggle with the vast search space of equations and may produce equations that
violate known physical laws. In this work, we address these problems by
introducing the concept of \textit{symmetry invariants} in equation discovery.
We leverage the fact that differential equations admitting a symmetry group can
be expressed in terms of differential invariants of symmetry transformations.
Thus, we propose to use these invariants as atomic entities in equation
discovery, ensuring the discovered equations satisfy the specified symmetry.
Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing equation discovery methods
such as sparse regression and genetic programming, improving their accuracy and
efficiency. We validate the proposed method through applications to various
physical systems, such as fluid and reaction-diffusion, demonstrating its
ability to recover parsimonious and interpretable equations that respect the
laws of physics.

Conclusion: AP-Calculus为因果推断提供了更全面的数学基础，适用于包括大语言模型在内的预测模型。

Abstract: This paper introduces Attribution Projection Calculus (AP-Calculus), a novel
mathematical framework for determining causal relationships in structured
Bayesian networks. We investigate a specific network architecture with source
nodes connected to destination nodes through intermediate nodes, where each
input maps to a single label with maximum marginal probability. We prove that
for each label, exactly one intermediate node acts as a deconfounder while
others serve as confounders, enabling optimal attribution of features to their
corresponding labels. The framework formalizes the dual nature of intermediate
nodes as both confounders and deconfounders depending on the context, and
establishes separation functions that maximize distinctions between
intermediate representations. We demonstrate that the proposed network
architecture is optimal for causal inference compared to alternative
structures, including those based on Pearl's causal framework. AP-Calculus
provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for analyzing feature-label
attributions, managing spurious correlations, quantifying information gain,
ensuring fairness, and evaluating uncertainty in prediction models, including

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）初始化时的统计特性，揭示了初始猜测偏差（IGB）与均值场（MF）理论的关系，表明优化的初始化必然具有偏见，并扩展了MF/IGB框架以指导多节点激活函数的初始化设计。

Motivation: 研究DNNs初始化的统计特性对理解其可训练性和内在架构偏见至关重要。

Method: 通过理论证明连接IGB与MF理论，并扩展框架至多节点激活函数。

Result: 发现优化的初始化必然具有偏见，并提供了稳定优化的初始化设计指南。

Conclusion: 初始化的偏见性与优化的可训练性密切相关，为DNNs初始化设计提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Understanding the statistical properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) at
initialization is crucial for elucidating both their trainability and the
intrinsic architectural biases they encode prior to data exposure. Mean-field
(MF) analyses have demonstrated that the parameter distribution in randomly
initialized networks dictates whether gradients vanish or explode.
Concurrently, untrained DNNs were found to exhibit an initial-guessing bias
(IGB), in which large regions of the input space are assigned to a single
class. In this work, we derive a theoretical proof establishing the
correspondence between IGB and previous MF theories, thereby connecting a
network prejudice toward specific classes with the conditions for fast and
accurate learning. This connection yields the counter-intuitive conclusion: the
initialization that optimizes trainability is necessarily biased, rather than
neutral. Furthermore, we extend the MF/IGB framework to multi-node activation
functions, offering practical guidelines for designing initialization schemes
that ensure stable optimization in architectures employing max- and
average-pooling layers.

Motivation: 现实世界中的组合动作空间导致动作数量指数增长，限制了传统强化学习算法的效果。现有方法未能捕捉复杂的联合行为。

Method: 提出SAINT架构，将多组件动作表示为无序集，并通过自注意力建模其依赖关系。

Result: 在15个组合环境中，包括近1700万联合动作的环境，SAINT表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SAINT具有置换不变性、样本高效性，且兼容标准策略优化算法，适用于复杂组合动作空间。

Abstract: The combinatorial structure of many real-world action spaces leads to
exponential growth in the number of possible actions, limiting the
effectiveness of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent
approaches for combinatorial action spaces impose factorized or sequential
structures over sub-actions, failing to capture complex joint behavior. We
introduce the Sub-Action Interaction Network using Transformers (SAINT), a
novel policy architecture that represents multi-component actions as unordered
sets and models their dependencies via self-attention conditioned on the global
state. SAINT is permutation-invariant, sample-efficient, and compatible with
standard policy optimization algorithms. In 15 distinct combinatorial
environments across three task domains, including environments with nearly 17
million joint actions, SAINT consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: We propose new graph kernels grounded in the study of metric graphs via
tropical algebraic geometry. In contrast to conventional graph kernels that are
based on graph combinatorics such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs, our graph
kernels are purely based on the geometry and topology of the underlying metric
space. A key characterizing property of our construction is its invariance
under edge subdivision, making the kernels intrinsically well-suited for
comparing graphs that represent different underlying spaces. We develop
efficient algorithms for computing these kernels and analyze their complexity,
showing that it depends primarily on the genus of the input graphs.
Empirically, our kernels outperform existing methods in label-free settings, as
demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. We further
highlight their practical utility through an urban road network classification
task.

Motivation: 现有分子图神经网络（GNNs）仅关注几何表示，忽略了公共数据库中的化学上下文信息。

Method: 引入多模态框架，整合文本描述（如IUPAC名称、分子式等）与分子图，采用门控融合机制。

Result: 实验显示，添加文本数据对某些电子属性有显著改进，但对其他属性提升有限。GNN架构表现相似。

Conclusion: 文本数据补充了分子图信息，但GNNs可能学习的是相似表示而非独特的物理见解。

Abstract: Molecular graph neural networks (GNNs) often focus exclusively on XYZ-based
geometric representations and thus overlook valuable chemical context available
in public databases like PubChem. This work introduces a multimodal framework
that integrates textual descriptors, such as IUPAC names, molecular formulas,
physicochemical properties, and synonyms, alongside molecular graphs. A gated
fusion mechanism balances geometric and textual features, allowing models to
exploit complementary information. Experiments on benchmark datasets indicate
that adding textual data yields notable improvements for certain electronic
properties, while gains remain limited for others. Furthermore, the GNN
architectures display similar performance patterns (improving and deteriorating
on analogous targets), suggesting they learn comparable representations rather
than distinctly different physical insights.

Conclusion: Transformer在解决病态逆问题中具有潜力，并为理解其知识提取机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformers have shown a remarkable ability for in-context learning (ICL),
making predictions based on contextual examples. However, while theoretical
analyses have explored this prediction capability, the nature of the inferred
context and its utility for downstream predictions remain open questions. This
paper aims to address these questions by examining ICL for inverse linear
regression (ILR), where context inference can be characterized by unsupervised
learning of underlying weight vectors. Focusing on the challenging scenario of
rank-deficient inverse problems, where context length is smaller than the
number of unknowns in the weight vectors and regularization is necessary, we
introduce a linear transformer to learn the inverse mapping from contextual
examples to the underlying weight vector. Our findings reveal that the
transformer implicitly learns both a prior distribution and an effective
regularization strategy, outperforming traditional ridge regression and
regularization methods. A key insight is the necessity of low task
dimensionality relative to the context length for successful learning.
Furthermore, we numerically verify that the error of the transformer estimator
scales linearly with the noise level, the ratio of task dimension to context
length, and the condition number of the input data. These results not only
demonstrate the potential of transformers for solving ill-posed inverse
problems, but also provide a new perspective towards understanding the
knowledge extraction mechanism within transformers.

Result: 不变分区作为结构化表示的基础原语，同时分区间的连接器支持任务相关转换的部署。

Conclusion: 不变分区是知识存储和学习的结构基础，通过关系代数形式化为结构化表示提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central
challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable
without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions,
requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which
such invariants should be defined, and which aspects of a system they should
characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge
structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions,
essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. We posit that
interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge;
hence, invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically, as
partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract
knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations,
forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs.
On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these
knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant
partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We
formalize the computational foundations for structured representation of the
invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic
structure.

Abstract: The rapid increase in computing power and the ability to store Big Data in
the infrastructure has enabled predictions in a large variety of domains by
Machine Learning. However, in many cases, existing Machine Learning tools are
considered insufficient or incorrect since they exploit only probabilistic
dependencies rather than inference logic. Causal Machine Learning methods seem
to close this gap. In this paper, two prevalent tools based on Causal Machine
Learning methods are compared, as well as their mathematical underpinning
background. The operation of the tools is demonstrated by examining their
response to 18 queries, based on the IDEAL Household Energy Dataset, published
by the University of Edinburgh. First, it was important to evaluate the causal
relations assumption that allowed the use of this approach; this was based on
the preexisting scientific knowledge of the domain and was implemented by use
of the in-built validation tools. Results were encouraging and may easily be
extended to other domains.

Abstract: Natural gradient methods significantly accelerate the training of
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), but are often prohibitively costly.
We introduce a suite of techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of
energy natural gradient descent (ENGD) for PINNs. First, we leverage the
Woodbury formula to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of ENGD.
Second, we adapt the Subsampled Projected-Increment Natural Gradient Descent
algorithm from the variational Monte Carlo literature to accelerate the
convergence. Third, we explore the use of randomized algorithms to further
reduce the computational cost in the case of large batch sizes. We find that
randomization accelerates progress in the early stages of training for
low-dimensional problems, and we identify key barriers to attaining
acceleration in other scenarios. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our
methods outperform previous approaches, achieving the same $L^2$ error as the
original ENGD up to $75\times$ faster.

Abstract: Large language models have recently made great strides in reasoning task
performance through chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies trained via reinforcement
learning; however, these "reasoning large language models" (RLLMs) remain
imperfect reasoners, and understanding the frequencies and causes of their
failure modes is important for both users and developers. We test o1-mini,
o3-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and Grok 3
Mini Beta on graph coloring as a variable-complexity constraint-satisfaction
logic problem, and find evidence from both error rate comparisons and
CoT/explanation text analysis that RLLMs are prone to hallucinate edges not
specified in the prompt's description of the graph. This phenomenon persists
across multiple problem complexity levels and semantic frames, and it appears
to account for a significant fraction of the incorrect answers from every
tested model, and the vast majority of them for some models. Our results
indicate that RLLMs may possess broader issues with misrepresentation of
problem specifics, and we offer suggestions for design choices to mitigate this
weakness.

Abstract: Deep learning-based weather forecasting models have recently demonstrated
significant performance improvements over gold-standard physics-based
simulation tools. However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
which raises concerns about their trustworthiness. In this paper, we first
investigate the feasibility of applying existing adversarial attack methods to
weather forecasting models. We argue that a successful attack should (1) not
modify significantly its original inputs, (2) be faithful, i.e., achieve the
desired forecast at targeted locations with minimal changes to non-targeted
locations, and (3) be geospatio-temporally realistic. However, balancing these
criteria is a challenge as existing methods are not designed to preserve the
geospatio-temporal dependencies of the original samples. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework called FABLE (Forecast Alteration By
Localized targeted advErsarial attack), which employs a 3D discrete wavelet
decomposition to extract the varying components of the geospatio-temporal data.
By regulating the magnitude of adversarial perturbations across different
components, FABLE can generate adversarial inputs that maintain
geospatio-temporal coherence while remaining faithful and closely aligned with
the original inputs. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework over baseline methods across
various metrics.

Conclusion: D-LinOSS通过灵活的能量耗散机制提升了长序列学习能力，同时简化了模型调优。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a class of networks for sequence learning that
benefit from fixed state size and linear complexity with respect to sequence
length, contrasting the quadratic scaling of typical attention mechanisms.
Inspired from observations in neuroscience, Linear Oscillatory State-Space
models (LinOSS) are a recently proposed class of SSMs constructed from layers
of discretized forced harmonic oscillators. Although these models perform
competitively, leveraging fast parallel scans over diagonal recurrent matrices
and achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks with sequence length up to
50k, LinOSS models rely on rigid energy dissipation ("forgetting") mechanisms
that are inherently coupled to the timescale of state evolution. As forgetting
is a crucial mechanism for long-range reasoning, we demonstrate the
representational limitations of these models and introduce Damped Linear
Oscillatory State-Space models (D-LinOSS), a more general class of oscillatory
SSMs that learn to dissipate latent state energy on multiple timescales. We
analyze the spectral distribution of the model's recurrent matrices and prove
that the SSM layers exhibit stable dynamics under simple, flexible
parameterizations. D-LinOSS consistently outperforms previous LinOSS methods on
long-range learning tasks, without introducing additional complexity, and
simultaneously reduces the hyperparameter search space by 50%.

Result: SEAM在低强度攻击下表现出卓越鲁棒性，高强度攻击下则导致性能崩溃，使模型无法使用。

Conclusion: SEAM为LLMs提供了一种有效的防御机制，显著提升了安全性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning attacks pose a major threat to the security of large
language models (LLMs), allowing adversaries to compromise safety guardrails
with minimal harmful data. While existing defenses attempt to reinforce LLM
alignment, they fail to address models' inherent "trainability" on harmful
data, leaving them vulnerable to stronger attacks with increased learning rates
or larger harmful datasets. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce
SEAM, a novel alignment-enhancing defense that transforms LLMs into
self-destructive models with intrinsic resilience to misalignment attempts.
Specifically, these models retain their capabilities for legitimate tasks while
exhibiting substantial performance degradation when fine-tuned on harmful data.
The protection is achieved through a novel loss function that couples the
optimization trajectories of benign and harmful data, enhanced with adversarial
gradient ascent to amplify the self-destructive effect. To enable practical
training, we develop an efficient Hessian-free gradient estimate with
theoretical error bounds. Extensive evaluation across LLMs and datasets
demonstrates that SEAM creates a no-win situation for adversaries: the
self-destructive models achieve state-of-the-art robustness against
low-intensity attacks and undergo catastrophic performance collapse under
high-intensity attacks, rendering them effectively unusable. (warning: this
paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing global health challenge, with
Bangladesh experiencing a notable rise in PD-related mortality. Early detection
of PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where
voice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective
alternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other
major languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a
significant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare
solutions. Moreover, most prior studies employed only a narrow set of acoustic
features, with limited or no hyperparameter tuning and feature selection
strategies, and little attention to model explainability. This restricts the
development of a robust and generalizable machine learning model. To address
this gap, we present BenSparX, the first Bengali conversational speech dataset
for PD detection, along with a robust and explainable machine learning
framework tailored for early diagnosis. The proposed framework incorporates
diverse acoustic feature categories, systematic feature selection methods, and
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with extensive hyperparameter
optimization. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability and trust in model
predictions, the framework incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
analysis to quantify the contribution of individual acoustic features toward PD
detection. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding an
accuracy of 95.77%, F1 score of 95.57%, and AUC-ROC of 0.982. We further
externally validated our approach by applying the framework to existing PD
datasets in other languages, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. To facilitate further research and reproducibility, the dataset has
been made publicly available at https://github.com/Riad071/BenSParX.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained
significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies
between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism,
and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with
SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical
analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity
and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more
accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications
and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we
study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based
S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of
$\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$,
where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$
denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the
discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample
complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve
optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$
simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through
numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical
worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed
algorithm.

Conclusion: 通过新机制，RL代理能够表现出更自然的风险回避行为，缩小了与生物代理的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural
question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which
have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this
question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in
a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a
striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of
self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency
gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which
exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging
this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms
that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our
approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic
environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns
that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习中，OOD动作的过度乐观评估问题限制了性能提升，现有方法可能过于保守或引入偏差。

Method: 利用动态模型想象OOD动作值，并通过行为值的最大值进行裁剪，保持对OOD动作的合理评估。

Result: 理论证明ILQ收敛，并在D4RL基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ILQ有效缓解了OOD动作的评估偏差，同时保持了合理的乐观性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning seeks to derive improved policies entirely
from historical data but often struggles with over-optimistic value estimates
for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. This issue is typically mitigated via
policy constraint or conservative value regularization methods. However, these
approaches may impose overly constraints or biased value estimates, potentially
limiting performance improvements. To balance exploitation and restriction, we
propose an Imagination-Limited Q-learning (ILQ) method, which aims to maintain
the optimism that OOD actions deserve within appropriate limits. Specifically,
we utilize the dynamics model to imagine OOD action-values, and then clip the
imagined values with the maximum behavior values. Such design maintains
reasonable evaluation of OOD actions to the furthest extent, while avoiding its
over-optimism. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the proposed ILQ
under tabular Markov decision processes. Particularly, we demonstrate that the
error bound between estimated values and optimality values of OOD state-actions
possesses the same magnitude as that of in-distribution ones, thereby
indicating that the bias in value estimates is effectively mitigated.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range
of tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

TL;DR: 本文综述了机器学习在军事和退伍军人自杀预测中的应用，总结了现有研究的成果与不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是军人和退伍军人中可预防的主要死因之一，早期预测对预防至关重要。

Method: 通过PubMed、IEEE、ACM和Google Scholar进行关键词搜索，采用PRISMA协议筛选32篇相关研究。

Result: 机器学习模型显示出合理的预测准确性，但存在研究空白，如对假阳性和假阴性的区分不足。

Conclusion: 自杀风险因素多样且复杂，需综合灵活的预防策略。

Abstract: Suicide remains one of the main preventable causes of death among active
service members and veterans. Early detection and prediction are crucial in
suicide prevention. Machine learning techniques have yielded promising results
in this area recently. This study aims to assess and summarize current research
and provides a comprehensive review regarding the application of machine
learning techniques in assessing and predicting suicidal ideation, attempts,
and mortality among members of military and veteran populations.
  A keyword search using PubMed, IEEE, ACM, and Google Scholar was conducted,
and the PRISMA protocol was adopted for relevant study selection. Thirty-two
articles met the inclusion criteria. These studies consistently identified risk
factors relevant to mental health issues such as depression, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, prior attempts, physical health
problems, and demographic characteristics.
  Machine learning models applied in this area have demonstrated reasonable
predictive accuracy. However, additional research gaps still exist. First, many
studies have overlooked metrics that distinguish between false positives and
negatives, such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value,
which are crucial in the context of suicide prevention policies. Second, more
dedicated approaches to handling survival and longitudinal data should be
explored. Lastly, most studies focused on machine learning methods, with
limited discussion of their connection to clinical rationales.
  In summary, machine learning analyses have identified a wide range of risk
factors associated with suicide in military populations. The diversity and
complexity of these factors also demonstrates that effective prevention
strategies must be comprehensive and flexible.

*Jizhou Guo,Zhaomin Wu,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELHSR是一种高效、参数少的奖励模型，利用LLM隐藏状态信息，显著优于基线模型，且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前奖励模型计算成本高且参数多，限制了实际应用，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出ELHSR模型，利用LLM隐藏状态信息，参数极少且训练样本需求少。

Result: ELHSR性能显著优于基线模型，计算效率提升多个数量级，且适用于闭源LLM。

Conclusion: ELHSR是一种高效、通用的奖励模型，可与传统模型结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: High-quality reward models are crucial for unlocking the reasoning potential
of large language models (LLMs), with best-of-N voting demonstrating
significant performance gains. However, current reward models, which typically
operate on the textual output of LLMs, are computationally expensive and
parameter-heavy, limiting their real-world applications. We introduce the
Efficient Linear Hidden State Reward (ELHSR) model - a novel, highly
parameter-efficient approach that leverages the rich information embedded in
LLM hidden states to address these issues. ELHSR systematically outperform
baselines with less than 0.005% of the parameters of baselines, requiring only
a few samples for training. ELHSR also achieves orders-of-magnitude efficiency
improvement with significantly less time and fewer FLOPs per sample than
baseline reward models. Moreover, ELHSR exhibits robust performance even when
trained only on logits, extending its applicability to some closed-source LLMs.
In addition, ELHSR can also be combined with traditional reward models to
achieve additional performance gains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种梯度无关的连续遗忘方法（ACU），解决了现有遗忘方法在连续学习中的局限性，实现了高效且精确的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度更新，无法满足连续学习中历史数据隐私保护和效率要求。

Method: 提出ACU方法，通过最小二乘法递归推导解析解，实现高效且精确的遗忘。

Result: 理论和实验验证了ACU在遗忘效果、模型保真度和系统效率上的优越性。

Conclusion: ACU为连续遗忘问题提供了高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence demands that models incrementally
update knowledge by Continual Learning (CL) to adapt to open-world
environments. To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning
(CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular
knowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods
primarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant
limitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to
the retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent
constraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these
methods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model
fidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by
adversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify
that the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from
their reliance on gradient-based updates. To bridge the research gap at its
root, we propose a novel gradient-free method for CU, named Analytic Continual
Unlearning (ACU), for efficient and exact forgetting with historical data
privacy preservation. In response to each unlearning request, our ACU
recursively derives an analytical (i.e., closed-form) solution in an
interpretable manner using the least squares method. Theoretical and
experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our ACU on unlearning
effectiveness, model fidelity, and system efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度自由方法AFCL，通过解析解解决联邦持续学习中的数据异构性问题，实现时空不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FCL方法因数据异构性导致模型性能下降，梯度对非IID数据的敏感性是根本原因。

Method: AFCL通过冻结提取特征推导解析解，本地训练仅需单次前向传播，全局聚合单轮更新。

Result: AFCL在理论和实验中均优于现有方法，实现与集中式联合学习相同的模型性能。

Conclusion: AFCL有效解决了FCL中的数据异构性问题，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) enables distributed clients to
collaboratively train a global model from online task streams in dynamic
real-world scenarios. However, existing FCL methods face challenges of both
spatial data heterogeneity among distributed clients and temporal data
heterogeneity across online tasks. Such data heterogeneity significantly
degrades the model performance with severe spatial-temporal catastrophic
forgetting of local and past knowledge. In this paper, we identify that the
root cause of this issue lies in the inherent vulnerability and sensitivity of
gradients to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue, we propose a
gradient-free method, named Analytic Federated Continual Learning (AFCL), by
deriving analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions from frozen extracted
features. In local training, our AFCL enables single-epoch learning with only a
lightweight forward-propagation process for each client. In global aggregation,
the server can recursively and efficiently update the global model with
single-round aggregation. Theoretical analyses validate that our AFCL achieves
spatio-temporal invariance of non-IID data. This ideal property implies that,
regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across local clients
and online tasks, the aggregated model of our AFCL remains invariant and
identical to that of centralized joint learning. Extensive experiments show the
consistent superiority of our AFCL over state-of-the-art baselines across
various benchmark datasets and settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Schoenberg定理的注意力机制（SchoenbAt），通过多项式基和随机Maclaurin特征近似点积核注意力，提升计算效率并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于随机特征的方法仅限于Fourier基展开，限制了核注意力优化的潜力。

Method: 利用Schoenberg定理，通过多项式基和随机Maclaurin特征近似点积核注意力，并采用两阶段正则化约束输入空间和恢复输出尺度。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，SchoenbAt在计算速度和性能上优于其他高效注意力方法。

Conclusion: SchoenbAt是一种高效且准确的核注意力近似方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Kernelized attention extends the attention mechanism by modeling sequence
correlations through kernel functions, making significant progresses in
optimizing attention. Under the guarantee of harmonic analysis theory, kernel
functions can be expanded with basis functions, inspiring random feature-based
approaches to enhance the efficiency of kernelized attention while maintaining
predictive performance. However, current random feature-based works are limited
to the Fourier basis expansions under Bochner's theorem. We propose
Schoenberg's theorem-based attention (SchoenbAt), which approximates
dot-product kernelized attention with the polynomial basis under Schoenberg's
theorem via random Maclaurin features and applies a two-stage regularization to
constrain the input space and restore the output scale, acting as a drop-in
replacement of dot-product kernelized attention. Our theoretical proof of the
unbiasedness and concentration error bound of SchoenbAt supports its efficiency
and accuracy as a kernelized attention approximation, which is also empirically
validated under various random feature dimensions. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate that SchoenbAt significantly enhances computational speed
while preserving competitive performance in terms of precision, outperforming
several efficient attention methods.

TL;DR: C-ABL通过分阶段引入知识库子集，逐步减小溯因空间，提升训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ABL因溯因空间过大导致训练不稳定，尤其在复杂知识库下表现不佳。

Method: 提出C-ABL，将知识库分阶段引入训练，逐步减小溯因空间。

Result: 实验表明C-ABL在训练稳定性、收敛速度和最终准确率上优于传统ABL。

Conclusion: C-ABL通过结构化知识库，有效解决了ABL的训练挑战。

Abstract: Abductive Learning (ABL) integrates machine learning with logical reasoning
in a loop: a learning model predicts symbolic concept labels from raw inputs,
which are revised through abduction using domain knowledge and then fed back
for retraining. However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training
process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is
large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While
prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they
typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we
propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly
leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL
training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of
sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction
space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a
stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL
outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training
stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex
knowledge setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SenseFlow提出了一种新型物理信息与自集成迭代框架，用于高精度电力潮流估计，解决了现有方法对电力系统特性的忽视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力潮流估计对电力系统稳定性至关重要，但现有方法未能充分考虑网络稀疏性和Slack节点的独特性。

Method: SenseFlow结合Physics-Informed Power Flow Network（FlowNet）和Self-Ensembling Iterative Estimation（SeIter），通过迭代优化电压幅值和相角预测。

Result: 实验表明，SenseFlow在多种电网配置下优于现有方法，实现了高精度估计。

Conclusion: SenseFlow为电力潮流估计提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Power flow estimation plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of electrical power systems, particularly in the context of growing
network complexities and renewable energy integration. However, existing
studies often fail to adequately address the unique characteristics of power
systems, such as the sparsity of network connections and the critical
importance of the unique Slack node, which poses significant challenges in
achieving high-accuracy estimations. In this paper, we present SenseFlow, a
novel physics-informed and self-ensembling iterative framework that integrates
two main designs, the Physics-Informed Power Flow Network (FlowNet) and
Self-Ensembling Iterative Estimation (SeIter), to carefully address the unique
properties of the power system and thereby enhance the power flow estimation.
Specifically, SenseFlow enforces the FlowNet to gradually predict
high-precision voltage magnitudes and phase angles through the iterative SeIter
process. On the one hand, FlowNet employs the Virtual Node Attention and
Slack-Gated Feed-Forward modules to facilitate efficient global-local
communication in the face of network sparsity and amplify the influence of the
Slack node on angle predictions, respectively. On the other hand, SeIter
maintains an exponential moving average of FlowNet's parameters to create a
robust ensemble model that refines power state predictions throughout the
iterative fitting process. Experimental results demonstrate that SenseFlow
outperforms existing methods, providing a promising solution for high-accuracy
power flow estimation across diverse grid configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦参数高效微调方法假设数据分布静态，无法应对新类不断出现的现实场景，导致灾难性遗忘和性能下降。

Method: 提出Fed-TaLoRA，通过共享任务无关的LoRA参数、后聚合模型校准和LoRA模块策略性放置，实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Fed-TaLoRA在数据异构场景中表现优于现有方法，同时显著减少资源需求。

Conclusion: Fed-TaLoRA为资源受限的联邦增量学习提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) reduces communication and
computation costs in federated fine-tuning of pre-trained models by updating
only a small subset of model parameters. However, existing approaches assume
static data distributions, failing to adequately address real-world scenarios
where new classes continually emerge, particularly in Federated Class
Incremental Learning (FCIL). FCIL faces two key challenges: catastrophic
forgetting and performance degradation caused by non-IID data across clients.
Unlike current methods that maintain separate task-specific components or
suffer from aggregation noise during parameter aggregation, we propose
Federated Task-agnostic Low-rank Residual Adaptation (Fed-TaLoRA), a novel
parameter-efficient approach for fine-tuning in resource-constrained FCIL
scenarios. Specifically, we fine-tune only shared task-agnostic LoRA parameters
across sequential tasks, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while
enabling efficient knowledge transfer among clients. Based on a theoretical
analysis of aggregation, we develop a novel residual weight update mechanism
that ensures accurate knowledge consolidation with minimal overhead. Our
methodological innovations are attributed to three key strategies:
task-agnostic adaptation, post-aggregation model calibration, and strategic
placement of LoRA modules. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Fed-TaLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in diverse data heterogeneity scenarios while substantially reducing resource
requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨模态模型复用中内部表示对齐的难题，现有方法需要大量配对数据或局限于特定领域。

Method: 采用条件流匹配方法，学习不同模态潜在空间之间的条件流，包括解决最优传输问题和利用标记样本进行高效对齐。

Result: 在MNIST、ImageNet等数据集上，下游任务性能与端到端训练模型相当，尤其在标记数据稀缺时表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态模型对齐提供了一种数据高效且需要最少监督的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across modalities
such as language and vision. However, model reuse across distinct modalities
(e.g., text and vision) remains limited due to the difficulty of aligning
internal representations. Existing methods require extensive paired training
data or are constrained to specific domains. We introduce a semi-supervised
approach for model alignment via conditional flow matching. The conditional
flow between latent spaces of different modalities (e.g., text-to-image or
biological-to-artificial neuronal activity) can be learned in two settings:
($1$) solving a (balanced or unbalanced) optimal transport problem with an
inter-space bridge cost, and ($2$) performing memory-efficient alignment using
labelled exemplars. Despite being constrained by the original models' capacity,
our method--under both settings--matches downstream task performance of
end-to-end trained models on object recognition and image generation tasks
across MNIST, ImageNet, and \cite{majaj2015simple} datasets, particularly when
labelled training data is scarce ($<20\%$). Our method provides a
data-efficient solution for inter-modal model alignment with minimal
supervision.

Result: 在26个数据集和多种GNN架构上表现优异，显著提升可扩展性。

Conclusion: GraphFLEx在大规模动态图上实现了高效、灵活且高性能的图结构学习。

Abstract: Graph structure learning is a core problem in graph-based machine learning,
essential for uncovering latent relationships and ensuring model
interpretability. However, most existing approaches are ill-suited for
large-scale and dynamically evolving graphs, as they often require complete
re-learning of the structure upon the arrival of new nodes and incur
substantial computational and memory costs. In this work, we propose GraphFLEx:
a unified and scalable framework for Graph Structure Learning in Large and
Expanding Graphs. GraphFLEx mitigates the scalability bottlenecks by
restricting edge formation to structurally relevant subsets of nodes identified
through a combination of clustering and coarsening techniques. This
dramatically reduces the search space and enables efficient, incremental graph
updates. The framework supports 48 flexible configurations by integrating
diverse choices of learning paradigms, coarsening strategies, and clustering
methods, making it adaptable to a wide range of graph settings and learning
objectives. Extensive experiments across 26 diverse datasets and Graph Neural
Network architectures demonstrate that GraphFLEx achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly improved scalability.

Motivation: 传统方法（如最大团转换和搜索算法）在处理大规模实例时存在可扩展性问题，NGA旨在解决这些限制。

Result: 实验表明，NGA在MCES计算、图相似性估计和图检索任务中显著提升了性能和可扩展性。

Conclusion: NGA为MCES计算提供了重要进展，并为其他分配问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem is a crucial challenge with
significant implications in domains such as biology and chemistry. Traditional
approaches, which include transformations into max-clique and search-based
algorithms, suffer from scalability issues when dealing with larger instances.
This paper introduces ``Neural Graduated Assignment'' (NGA), a simple,
scalable, unsupervised-training-based method that addresses these limitations
by drawing inspiration from the classical Graduated Assignment (GA) technique.
Central to NGA is stacking of neural components that closely resemble the GA
process, but with the reparameterization of learnable temperature into higher
dimension. We further theoretically analyze the learning dynamics of NGA,
showing its design leads to fast convergence, better exploration-exploitation
tradeoff, and ability to escape local optima. Extensive experiments across MCES
computation, graph similarity estimation, and graph retrieval tasks reveal that
NGA not only significantly improves computation time and scalability on large
instances but also enhances performance compared to existing methodologies. The
introduction of NGA marks a significant advancement in the computation of MCES
and offers insights into other assignment problems.

Method: DCLA通过聚合先前层的表示构建动态语义参考，并校正语义偏离的层以增强层间一致性。

Result: 在MME和POPE等基准测试中，DCLA显著减少了幻觉并提升了模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: DCLA是一种无需额外训练的高效幻觉缓解方法，适用于多种大型视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
they remain susceptible to hallucinations-generating content that is
inconsistent with the input image. Existing training-free hallucination
mitigation methods often suffer from unstable performance and high sensitivity
to hyperparameter settings, limiting their practicality and broader adoption.
In this paper, we propose a novel decoding mechanism, Decoding with Inter-layer
Consistency via Layer Aggregation (DCLA), which requires no retraining,
fine-tuning, or access to external knowledge bases. Specifically, our approach
constructs a dynamic semantic reference by aggregating representations from
previous layers, and corrects semantically deviated layers to enforce
inter-layer consistency. The method allows DCLA to robustly mitigate
hallucinations across multiple LVLMs. Experiments on hallucination benchmarks
such as MME and POPE demonstrate that DCLA effectively reduces hallucinations
while enhancing the reliability and performance of LVLMs.

stability guarantees.

Conclusion: 通过伴随算子推广的范数和杠杆得分方法，填补了非线性模型工具空白，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: While norm-based and leverage-score-based methods have been extensively
studied for identifying "important" data points in linear models, analogous
tools for nonlinear models remain significantly underdeveloped. By introducing
the concept of the adjoint operator of a nonlinear map, we address this gap and
generalize norm-based and leverage-score-based importance sampling to nonlinear
settings. We demonstrate that sampling based on these generalized notions of
norm and leverage scores provides approximation guarantees for the underlying
nonlinear mapping, similar to linear subspace embeddings. As direct
applications, these nonlinear scores not only reduce the computational
complexity of training nonlinear models by enabling efficient sampling over
large datasets but also offer a novel mechanism for model explainability and
outlier detection. Our contributions are supported by both theoretical analyses
and experimental results across a variety of supervised learning scenarios.

Result: 包装器继承了备用策略的目标达成保证，同时保持或提升基础策略性能，无需额外系统知识或在线约束优化。

Conclusion: 该包装器易于部署，适用于多种强化学习架构和任务，兼顾性能与安全性。

Abstract: We introduce a universal policy wrapper for reinforcement learning agents
that ensures formal goal-reaching guarantees. In contrast to standard
reinforcement learning algorithms that excel in performance but lack rigorous
safety assurances, our wrapper selectively switches between a high-performing
base policy -- derived from any existing RL method -- and a fallback policy
with known convergence properties. Base policy's value function supervises this
switching process, determining when the fallback policy should override the
base policy to ensure the system remains on a stable path. The analysis proves
that our wrapper inherits the fallback policy's goal-reaching guarantees while
preserving or improving upon the performance of the base policy. Notably, it
operates without needing additional system knowledge or online constrained
optimization, making it readily deployable across diverse reinforcement
learning architectures and tasks.

Motivation: 现有CDR设计方法未联合优化结合能，且依赖昂贵且不可靠的在线强化学习。

Method: 提出AbFlowNet，将扩散步骤作为GFlowNet状态，直接整合能量信号优化扩散损失与结合能。

Result: AbFlowNet在氨基酸恢复、几何重建和结合能改进上显著优于基线模型，且降低了能量误差。

Conclusion: AbFlowNet为抗体设计提供了一种高效且统一的优化框架。

Abstract: Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs) are critical segments of an
antibody that facilitate binding to specific antigens. Current computational
methods for CDR design utilize reconstruction losses and do not jointly
optimize binding energy, a crucial metric for antibody efficacy. Rather,
binding energy optimization is done through computationally expensive Online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipelines rely heavily on unreliable binding energy
estimators. In this paper, we propose AbFlowNet, a novel generative framework
that integrates GFlowNet with Diffusion models. By framing each diffusion step
as a state in the GFlowNet framework, AbFlowNet jointly optimizes standard
diffusion losses and binding energy by directly incorporating energy signals
into the training process, thereby unifying diffusion and reward optimization
in a single procedure. Experimental results show that AbFlowNet outperforms the
base diffusion model by 3.06% in amino acid recovery, 20.40% in geometric
reconstruction (RMSD), and 3.60% in binding energy improvement ratio. ABFlowNet
also decreases Top-1 total energy and binding energy errors by 24.8% and 38.1%
without pseudo-labeling the test dataset or using computationally expensive
online RL regimes.

TL;DR: STAR是一种无需训练、即插即用的视觉语言模型（LVLM）令牌剪枝框架，通过两阶段注意力引导的剪枝策略，显著降低计算成本并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单阶段令牌剪枝方法仅关注视觉自注意力或视觉-文本跨模态注意力，忽略了全局信息流，导致性能下降。

Method: STAR采用两阶段剪枝：早期基于视觉自注意力剪枝去除冗余低层特征，后期基于跨模态注意力剪枝去除任务无关令牌。

Result: 实验表明，STAR在多种LVLM架构和基准测试中显著加速计算，同时保持甚至提升性能。

Conclusion: STAR通过全局视角的两阶段剪枝策略，有效平衡计算效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) leverage rich visual token
representations to achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, these tokens
also introduce significant computational overhead during inference. Existing
training-free token pruning methods typically adopt a single-stage strategy,
focusing either on visual self-attention or visual-textual cross-attention.
However, such localized perspectives often overlook the broader information
flow across the model, leading to substantial performance degradation,
especially under high pruning ratios. In this work, we propose STAR (Stage-wise
Attention-guided token Reduction), a training-free, plug-and-play framework
that approaches token pruning from a global perspective. Instead of pruning at
a single point, STAR performs attention-guided reduction in two complementary
stages: an early-stage pruning based on visual self-attention to remove
redundant low-level features, and a later-stage pruning guided by cross-modal
attention to discard task-irrelevant tokens. This holistic approach allows STAR
to significantly reduce computational cost while better preserving
task-critical information. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLM
architectures and benchmarks show that STAR achieves strong acceleration while
maintaining comparable, and in some cases even improved performance.

TL;DR: 论文分析了GRPO在二元奖励设置下的局限性，提出了新的DisCO框架，显著优于GRPO及其变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示GRPO在问题难度偏差上的固有局限性，并探索其与监督学习中判别方法的联系。

Method: 提出Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO)框架，采用判别目标、非裁剪RL替代目标和约束优化方法。

Result: DisCO在数学推理任务中平均提升7%和6%优于GRPO和DAPO。

Conclusion: DisCO通过消除难度偏差和提升稳定性，为强化大型推理模型提供了更优方法。

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread
attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement
learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the
GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation
of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO
and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by
these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization
(DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of
discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its
recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a
discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons
clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used
as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained
optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable
training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its
variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting
discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO
and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a
constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of
advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a
significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated
answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly
outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average
gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B
model.

Result: 在Spider和BIRD基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Graph-Reward-SQL框架显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text-to-SQL tasks. However,
existing methods often rely on execution-based or LLM-based Bradley-Terry
reward models. The former suffers from high execution latency caused by
repeated database calls, whereas the latter imposes substantial GPU memory
overhead, both of which significantly hinder the efficiency and scalability of
RL pipelines. To this end, we propose a novel Text-to-SQL RL fine-tuning
framework named Graph-Reward-SQL, which employs the GMNScore outcome reward
model. We leverage SQL graph representations to provide accurate reward signals
while significantly reducing inference time and GPU memory usage. Building on
this foundation, we further introduce StepRTM, a stepwise reward model that
provides intermediate supervision over Common Table Expression (CTE)
subqueries. This encourages both functional correctness and structural clarity
of SQL. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments on standard benchmarks,
including Spider and BIRD, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing reward models.

Conclusion: 熵力与对称性破缺的结合是理解深度学习中涌现现象的关键。

Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large
language models, explaining and understanding their cause has become an urgent
need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the
learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an
entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially
governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and
discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter
symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance
phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These
phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural
representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic
Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory
observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning
optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of
entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent
phenomena in deep learning.

Result: 所有求解器的结果与参考解吻合良好，证明了其准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PINN方法为扭转行为分析提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，可根据需求选择不同求解器。

Abstract: The Saint-Venant torsion theory is a classical theory for analyzing the
torsional behavior of structural components, and it remains critically
important in modern computational design workflows. Conventional numerical
methods, including the finite element method (FEM), typically rely on
mesh-based approaches to obtain approximate solutions. However, these methods
often require complex and computationally intensive techniques to overcome the
limitations of approximation, leading to significant increases in computational
cost. The objective of this study is to develop a series of novel numerical
methods based on physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving the
Saint-Venant torsion equations. Utilizing the expressive power and the
automatic differentiation capability of neural networks, the PINN can solve
partial differential equations (PDEs) along with boundary conditions without
the need for intricate computational techniques. First, a PINN solver was
developed to compute the torsional constant for bars with arbitrary
cross-sectional geometries. This was followed by the development of a solver
capable of handling cases with sharp geometric transitions; variable-scaling
PINN (VS-PINN). Finally, a parametric PINN was constructed to address the
limitations of conventional single-instance PINN. The results from all three
solvers showed good agreement with reference solutions, demonstrating their
accuracy and robustness. Each solver can be selectively utilized depending on
the specific requirements of torsional behavior analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，适用于快速移除扩散模型中的特定概念。

Abstract: Image Generation models are a trending topic nowadays, with many people
utilizing Artificial Intelligence models in order to generate images. There are
many such models which, given a prompt of a text, will generate an image which
depicts said prompt. There are many image generation models, such as Latent
Diffusion Models, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Generative
Adversarial Networks and many more. When generating images, these models can
generate sensitive image data, which can be threatening to privacy or may
violate copyright laws of private entities. Machine unlearning aims at removing
the influence of specific data subsets from the trained models and in the case
of image generation models, remove the influence of a concept such that the
model is unable to generate said images of the concept when prompted.
Conventional retraining of the model can take upto days, hence fast algorithms
are the need of the hour. In this paper we propose an algorithm that aims to
remove the influence of concepts in diffusion models through updating the
gradients of the final layers of the text encoders. Using a weighted loss
function, we utilize backpropagation in order to update the weights of the
final layers of the Text Encoder componet of the Stable Diffusion Model,
removing influence of the concept from the text-image embedding space, such
that when prompted, the result is an image not containing the concept. The
weighted loss function makes use of Textual Inversion and Low-Rank
Adaptation.We perform our experiments on Latent Diffusion Models, namely the
Stable Diffusion v2 model, with an average concept unlearning runtime of 50
seconds using 4-5 images.

Motivation: 层次数据在多个领域普遍存在，但传统残差量化（RQ）依赖欧几里得几何，难以准确建模层次分支结构。

Method: HRQ在双曲流形中嵌入数据，并使用双曲操作和距离度量进行残差量化，以更自然地匹配层次结构。

Result: 在WordNet超名词树和监督与非监督任务中，HRQ性能优于RQ，最高提升20%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何的引入显著提升了离散表示学习对潜在层次结构的捕捉能力。

Abstract: Hierarchical data arise in countless domains, from biological taxonomies and
organizational charts to legal codes and knowledge graphs. Residual
Quantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken
representations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a
multilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce
fundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching,
necessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we
propose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a
hyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic
operations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual
computation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an
inductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that
HRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete
hierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ
on two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where
the model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy
discovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not
directly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both
scenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks
compared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\%$ for the hierarchy modeling
task. Our results demonstrate that integrating hyperbolic geometry into
discrete representation learning substantially enhances the ability to capture
latent hierarchies.

Conclusion: 图重连是提升异质性图性能的有效策略，且具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at analyzing graph-structured data but
struggle on heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes often belong to
different classes. While this challenge is commonly addressed with specialized
GNN architectures, graph rewiring remains an underexplored strategy in this
context. We provide theoretical foundations linking edge homophily, GNN
embedding smoothness, and node classification performance, motivating the need
to enhance homophily. Building on this insight, we introduce a rewiring
framework that increases graph homophily using a reference graph, with
theoretical guarantees on the homophily of the rewired graph. To broaden
applicability, we propose a label-driven diffusion approach for constructing a
homophilic reference graph from node features and training labels. Through
extensive simulations, we analyze how the homophily of both the original and
reference graphs influences the rewired graph homophily and downstream GNN
performance. We evaluate our method on 11 real-world heterophilic datasets and
show that it outperforms existing rewiring techniques and specialized GNNs for
heterophilic graphs, achieving improved node classification accuracy while
remaining efficient and scalable to large graphs.

Conclusion: 研究为同质网络中不同规模网络的优化解结构提供了新见解，揭示了宽度和参数冗余的作用。

Abstract: Understanding the convergence points and optimization landscape of neural
networks is crucial, particularly for homogeneous networks where
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the associated maximum-margin problem often
characterize solutions. This paper investigates the relationship between such
KKT points across networks of different widths generated via neuron splitting.
We introduce and formalize the \textbf{KKT point embedding principle},
establishing that KKT points of a homogeneous network's max-margin problem
($P_{\Phi}$) can be embedded into the KKT points of a larger network's problem
($P_{\tilde{\Phi}}$) via specific linear isometric transformations
corresponding to neuron splitting. We rigorously prove this principle holds for
neuron splitting in both two-layer and deep homogeneous networks. Furthermore,
we connect this static embedding to the dynamics of gradient flow training with
smooth losses. We demonstrate that trajectories initiated from appropriately
mapped points remain mapped throughout training and that the resulting
$\omega$-limit sets of directions are correspondingly mapped ($T(L(\theta(0)))
= L(\boldsymbol{\eta}(0))$), thereby preserving the alignment with KKT
directions dynamically when directional convergence occurs. Our findings offer
insights into the effects of network width, parameter redundancy, and the
structural connections between solutions found via optimization in homogeneous
networks of varying sizes.

Abstract: Recently, innovative adaptations of the Ritz Method incorporating deep
learning have been developed, known as the Deep Ritz Method. This approach
employs a neural network as the test function for variational problems.
However, the neural network does not inherently satisfy the boundary conditions

introduces a penalty term into the functional of the variational problem, which
can lead to misleading results during the optimization process. In this work,
an ansatz is proposed that inherently satisfies the boundary conditions of the
variational problem. The results demonstrate that the proposed ansatz not only
eliminates misleading outcomes but also reduces complexity while maintaining
accuracy, showcasing its practical effectiveness in addressing variational

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in improving the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the specific challenges of
adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In
this work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw
inspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy
to difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end,
we construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according
to the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle
multimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages
careful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and
clearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus
reward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint,
alongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and
medium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a
greater impact on training. Our experiments with the Qwen2.5-VL-3B and
Qwen2.5-VL-7B models on 20k samples from the NeuraLadder dataset show that
Observe-R1 outperforms a series of larger reasoning models on both reasoning
and general benchmarks, achieving superior clarity and conciseness in reasoning
chains. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our strategies,
highlighting the robustness and generalization of our approach. The dataset and
code will be released at https://github.com/zrguo/Observe-R1.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is broadly utilized for aligning Large
Language Models (LLMs) with human values because of its flexibility. Despite
its effectiveness, it has been observed that the capability of DPO to generate
human-preferred response is limited and the results of DPO are far from
resilient. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a novel
Self-Guided Direct Preference Optimization algorithm, i.e., SGDPO, which
incorporates a pilot term to steer the gradient flow during the optimization
process, allowing for fine-grained control over the updates of chosen and
rejected rewards. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of our proposed
method and elucidate its operational mechanism. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments on various models and benchmarks. The extensive

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto model for
learning from structured data, their decisional process remains opaque to the
end user, undermining their deployment in safety-critical applications. In the
case of graph classification, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
techniques address this major issue by identifying sub-graph motifs that
explain predictions. However, advancements in this field are hindered by a
chronic scarcity of benchmark datasets with known ground-truth motifs to assess
the explanations' quality. Current graph XAI benchmarks are limited to
synthetic data or a handful of real-world tasks hand-curated by domain experts.
In this paper, we propose a general method to automate the construction of XAI
benchmarks for graph classification from real-world datasets. We provide both
15 ready-made benchmarks, as well as the code to generate more than 2000
additional XAI benchmarks with our method. As a use case, we employ our
benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of some popular graph explainers.

Motivation: LoRA及其变体在低秩空间中的性能不足，且梯度近似和动量集成导致内存成本接近全微调。

Method: 提出AltLoRA，采用交替投影方法，避免联合更新设计中的梯度近似问题，并集成动量而不增加内存复杂度。

Conclusion: AltLoRA在性能和内存效率之间取得了更好的平衡，缩小了与全微调的差距。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing
memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers
from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is
constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to
mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to
approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and
different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation
studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design,
approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a
higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in
integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost.
In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids
the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design,
meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our
theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that
AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation
invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that
AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full
fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.

TL;DR: UFO-RL框架通过单次不确定性估计高效选择数据，显著提升LLM强化学习的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多采样方法计算成本高，而ZPD理论启发我们专注于LLM潜在理解范围内的数据。

Method: 提出UFO-RL框架，利用单次不确定性估计快速评估数据价值，并选择ZPD范围内的数据训练。

Result: 仅用10%数据即可达到或超越全数据训练效果，训练时间减少16倍，稳定性与泛化性提升。

Conclusion: UFO-RL为LLM强化学习提供了一种高效实用的数据选择策略。

Abstract: Scaling RL for LLMs is computationally expensive, largely due to
multi-sampling for policy optimization and evaluation, making efficient data
selection crucial. Inspired by the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory,
we hypothesize LLMs learn best from data within their potential comprehension
zone. Addressing the limitation of conventional, computationally intensive
multi-sampling methods for data assessment, we introduce UFO-RL. This novel
framework uses a computationally efficient single-pass uncertainty estimation
to identify informative data instances, achieving up to 185x faster data
evaluation. UFO-RL leverages this metric to select data within the estimated
ZPD for training. Experiments show that training with just 10% of data selected
by UFO-RL yields performance comparable to or surpassing full-data training,
reducing overall training time by up to 16x while enhancing stability and
generalization. UFO-RL offers a practical and highly efficient strategy for
scaling RL fine-tuning of LLMs by focusing learning on valuable data.

*Asher Labovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出用k-means离散化替代传统分位数分箱，以提升梯度提升决策树（GBDT）的预测性能，尤其在回归任务和有限分箱预算下表现显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分位数分箱可能忽略关键边界值，影响预测性能。

Method: 用k-means离散化初始化分箱，并在33个OpenML任务和合成数据上测试。

Result: k-means在回归任务中表现优异（如55% MSE下降），分类任务中与分位数分箱相当，合成数据中MSE提升显著（>20%）。

Conclusion: 建议将k-means作为默认分箱方法，尤其在回归和有限预算场景下，因其性能优越且开销低。

Abstract: Modern gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) accelerate split finding with
histogram-based binning, which reduces complexity from O(N) to O(B) given a
fixed bin budget B. However, the predominant quantile binning strategy-designed
to distribute data points evenly among bins-may overlook critical boundary
values that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we propose
replacing quantile binning with a k-means discretizer initialized with quantile
bins. We test this swap on 33 OpenML tasks plus synthetics that control for
modality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no
statistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in four cases-most
strikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though
k-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15
classification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs
0.68) with gaps $\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large
MSE gains-typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or
bin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exact splitting
when extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that
quantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means
flag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the
32-64-bin GPU regime-because it is a "safe default" with large upside, yet adds
only a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\approx$ 2s to bin 10M rows on one core).

TL;DR: 论文提出了Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)算法，首次为鲁棒平均奖励强化学习提供了有限样本复杂度保证，填补了该领域的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鲁棒强化学习在平均奖励准则下对长期决策至关重要，但现有研究缺乏有限样本复杂度的分析，阻碍了其实际应用。

Method: 提出RHI算法，适用于标准不确定性集（如污染集和ℓp范数球），无需先验知识即可实现近最优样本复杂度。

Result: RHI在样本复杂度为Õ(SAH²/ε²)的情况下达到ε最优策略，首次为鲁棒平均奖励RL提供多项式样本复杂度保证。

Conclusion: RHI显著提升了鲁棒平均奖励方法在复杂实际问题中的实用性。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is
crucial for long-term decision making under potential environment mismatches,
yet its finite-sample complexity study remains largely unexplored. Existing
works offer algorithms with asymptotic guarantees, but the absence of
finite-sample analysis hinders its principled understanding and practical
deployment, especially in data-limited settings. We close this gap by proposing
Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI), the first algorithm with provable finite-sample
complexity guarantee. Under standard uncertainty sets -- including
contamination sets and $\ell_p$-norm balls -- RHI attains an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy with near-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal
O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote
the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias
span. This result gives the first polynomial sample complexity guarantee for
robust average-reward RL. Moreover, our RHI's independence from prior knowledge
distinguishes it from many previous average-reward RL studies. Our work thus
constitutes a significant advancement in enhancing the practical applicability
of robust average-reward methods to complex, real-world problems.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法忽视了市场做市中的延迟问题，导致订单取消和库存积累风险，无法应用于实际场景。

Method: 构建了模拟真实延迟的MM环境，提出Relaver方法，包括增强状态-动作空间、动态编程引导探索和市场趋势预测器。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，Relaver显著优于现有RL方法。

Conclusion: Relaver有效解决了延迟和库存风险问题，提升了市场做市的性能。

Abstract: The latency of the exchanges in Market Making (MM) is inevitable due to
hardware limitations, system processing times, delays in receiving data from
exchanges, the time required for order transmission to reach the market, etc.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods for Market Making (MM) overlook
the impact of these latency, which can lead to unintended order cancellations
due to price discrepancies between decision and execution times and result in
undesired inventory accumulation, exposing MM traders to increased market risk.
Therefore, these methods cannot be applied in real MM scenarios. To address
these issues, we first build a realistic MM environment with random delays of
30-100 milliseconds for order placement and market information reception, and
implement a batch matching mechanism that collects orders within every 500
milliseconds before matching them all at once, simulating the batch auction
mechanisms adopted by some exchanges. Then, we propose Relaver, an RL-based
method for MM to tackle the latency and inventory risk issues. The three main
contributions of Relaver are: i) we introduce an augmented state-action space
that incorporates order hold time alongside price and volume, enabling Relaver
to optimize execution strategies under latency constraints and time-priority
matching mechanisms, ii) we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to guide the
exploration of RL training for better policies, iii) we train a market trend
predictor, which can guide the agent to intelligently adjust the inventory to
reduce the risk. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Relaver} significantly improves the
performance of state-of-the-art RL-based MM strategies across multiple metrics.

Result: 发现联合嵌入方法对无关特征的条件要求较弱，在无关特征影响较大时表现更优。

Conclusion: 联合嵌入方法在现实复杂数据集中更具优势，为自监督学习范式选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in
Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the
original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint
embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space.
Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear
guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core
mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions
for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process,
e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then
demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a
minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve
asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that
in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint
embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker
alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not
only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the
empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬阈值压缩虽然计算复杂度低，但在非独立同分布数据和步长衰减的联邦学习中会导致精度下降。

Method: 提出γ-FedHT，一种步长感知的低成本压缩器，结合误差反馈机制。

Result: 实验表明，γ-FedHT在相同通信流量下比Top-k方法精度提升高达7.42%。

Conclusion: γ-FedHT在保证收敛性的同时，显著提升了联邦学习的精度。

Abstract: Gradient compression can effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks in
Federated Learning (FL). Contemporary state-of-the-art sparse compressors, such
as Top-$k$, exhibit high computational complexity, up to
$\mathcal{O}(d\log_2{k})$, where $d$ is the number of model parameters. The
hard-threshold compressor, which simply transmits elements with absolute values
higher than a fixed threshold, is thus proposed to reduce the complexity to
$\mathcal{O}(d)$. However, the hard-threshold compression causes accuracy
degradation in FL, where the datasets are non-IID and the stepsize $\gamma$ is
decreasing for model convergence. The decaying stepsize reduces the updates and
causes the compression ratio of the hard-threshold compression to drop rapidly
to an aggressive ratio. At or below this ratio, the model accuracy has been
observed to degrade severely. To address this, we propose $\gamma$-FedHT, a
stepsize-aware low-cost compressor with Error-Feedback to guarantee
convergence. Given that the traditional theoretical framework of FL does not
consider Error-Feedback, we introduce the fundamental conversation of
Error-Feedback. We prove that $\gamma$-FedHT has the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ ($T$ representing total training iterations) under
$\mu$-strongly convex cases and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ under
non-convex cases, \textit{same as FedAVG}. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that $\gamma$-FedHT improves accuracy by up to $7.42\%$ over Top-$k$ under
equal communication traffic on various non-IID image datasets.

Motivation: 现有RL方法（如GRPO、REINFORCE++和RLOO）在语言模型训练中存在不稳定性，导致训练崩溃。

Method: CPGD引入基于KL散度的策略漂移约束和比例对数剪裁机制，动态调整策略更新。

Result: CPGD显著提高了训练稳定性，同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: CPGD为语言模型的强化学习后训练提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly
improved the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) with rule-based
rewards. However, existing RL methods -- such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and RLOO --
often suffer from training instability, where large policy updates and improper
clipping can lead to training collapse. To address this issue, we propose
Clipped Policy Gradient Optimization with Policy Drift (CPGD), a novel
algorithm designed to stabilize policy learning in LMs. CPGD introduces a
policy drift constraint based on KL divergence to dynamically regularize policy
updates, and leverages a clip mechanism on the logarithm of the ratio to
prevent excessive policy updates. We provide theoretical justification for CPGD
and demonstrate through empirical analysis that it mitigates the instability
observed in prior approaches. Furthermore, we show that CPGD significantly
improves performance while maintaining training stability. Our implementation
balances theoretical rigor with practical usability, offering a robust
alternative for RL in the post-training of LMs. We release our code at
https://github.com/ModalMinds/MM-EUREKA.

Motivation: 传统IRM依赖标签数据，而实际场景中标签可能不可用，因此需要无监督方法实现分布不变性。

Method: 提出PICA（线性方法）和VIAE（深度生成模型），基于无监督结构因果模型，支持环境条件样本生成和干预。

Result: 在合成数据和MNIST变体上验证了方法在捕捉不变结构、保留信息及跨环境泛化的有效性。

Conclusion: 无监督IRM框架在无标签情况下仍能实现鲁棒表示学习，扩展了IRM的应用范围。

Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised framework for \emph{Invariant Risk
Minimization} (IRM), extending the concept of invariance to settings where
labels are unavailable. Traditional IRM methods rely on labeled data to learn
representations that are robust to distributional shifts across environments.
In contrast, our approach redefines invariance through feature distribution
alignment, enabling robust representation learning from unlabeled data. We
introduce two methods within this framework: Principal Invariant Component
Analysis (PICA), a linear method that extracts invariant directions under
Gaussian assumptions, and Variational Invariant Autoencoder (VIAE), a deep
generative model that disentangles environment-invariant and
environment-dependent latent factors. Our approach is based on a novel
``unsupervised'' structural causal model and supports environment-conditioned
sample-generation and intervention. Empirical evaluations on synthetic dataset
and modified versions of MNIST demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in
capturing invariant structure, preserving relevant information, and
generalizing across environments without access to labels.

Result: 在MicroRTS和Karel the Robot中，InnateCoder样本效率优于其他方法。

Conclusion: InnateCoder证明了利用人类知识提升强化学习效率的潜力。

Abstract: Outside of transfer learning settings, reinforcement learning agents start
their learning process from a clean slate. As a result, such agents have to go
through a slow process to learn even the most obvious skills required to solve
a problem. In this paper, we present InnateCoder, a system that leverages human
knowledge encoded in foundation models to provide programmatic policies that
encode "innate skills" in the form of temporally extended actions, or options.
In contrast to existing approaches to learning options, InnateCoder learns them
from the general human knowledge encoded in foundation models in a zero-shot
setting, and not from the knowledge the agent gains by interacting with the
environment. Then, InnateCoder searches for a programmatic policy by combining
the programs encoding these options into larger and more complex programs. We
hypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve
the sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies.
Empirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since
they show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system
that do not use options or learn them from experience.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的广泛应用，解释其预测的需求日益迫切。由于LLMs架构多样且部分闭源，模型无关技术显示出潜力，但现有方法因需多次调用LLMs而成本高昂。

Method: 通过一系列实证研究，证明可以从低成本模型中采样生成忠实解释。

Result: 代理解释在下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的模型无关解释方法提供了新范式，即利用低成本模型的信息。

Abstract: With Large language models (LLMs) becoming increasingly prevalent in various
applications, the need for interpreting their predictions has become a critical
challenge. As LLMs vary in architecture and some are closed-sourced,
model-agnostic techniques show great promise without requiring access to the
model's internal parameters. However, existing model-agnostic techniques need
to invoke LLMs many times to gain sufficient samples for generating faithful
explanations, which leads to high economic costs. In this paper, we show that
it is practical to generate faithful explanations for large-scale LLMs by
sampling from some budget-friendly models through a series of empirical
studies. Moreover, we show that such proxy explanations also perform well on
downstream tasks. Our analysis provides a new paradigm of model-agnostic
explanation methods for LLMs, by including information from budget-friendly
models.

Result: 开发的工具集在持续学习中表现出协同效应，优于独立方法。

Conclusion: 该工具集为持续学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Future deep learning models will be distinguished by systems that perpetually
learn through interaction, imagination, and cooperation, blurring the line
between training and inference. This makes continual learning a critical
challenge, as methods that efficiently maximize bidirectional transfer across
learning trajectories will be essential. Replay is on track to play a
foundational role in continual learning, allowing models to directly reconcile
new information with past knowledge. In practice, however, replay is quite
unscalable, doubling the cost of continual learning when applied naively.
Moreover, the continual learning literature has not fully synchronized with the
multi-task fine-tuning literature, having not fully integrated highly scalable
techniques like model merging and low rank adaptation into a replay-enabled
toolset that can produce a unified model in the face of many sequential tasks.
In this paper, we begin by applying and analyzing low rank adaptation in a
continual learning setting. Next, we introduce consolidation, a phasic approach
to replay which leads to up to 55\% less replay samples being needed for a
given performance target. Then, we propose sequential merging, an offshoot of
task arithmetic which is tailored to the continual learning setting and is
shown to work well in combination with replay. Finally, we demonstrate that the
developed strategies can operate synergistically, resulting in a highly
scalable toolset that outperforms standalone variants.

Conclusion: 连续CoTs通过并行搜索显著提升效率，且训练过程中能自发形成叠加状态。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts
(CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the
questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete
tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a
theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in
various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental
graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as
special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$
steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem,
where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of
constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps
where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each
continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search
frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while
discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state,
which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be
trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify
that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution
obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers
as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs,
without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths
simultaneously.

Conclusion: HAL为时序图学习提供高效、轻量、架构无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs), while being accurate, face significant
training inefficiencies due to irregular supervision signals in dynamic graphs,
which induce sparse gradient updates. We first theoretically establish that
aggregating historical node interactions into pseudo-labels reduces gradient
variance, accelerating convergence. Building on this analysis, we propose
History-Averaged Labels (HAL), a method that dynamically enriches training
batches with pseudo-targets derived from historical label distributions. HAL
ensures continuous parameter updates without architectural modifications by
converting idle computation into productive learning steps. Experiments on the
Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) validate our findings and an assumption about
slow change of user preferences: HAL accelerates TGNv2 training by up to 15x
while maintaining competitive performance. Thus, this work offers an efficient,
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and theoretically motivated solution to
label sparsity in temporal graph learning.

Conclusion: 部分公平框架在实用性和性能间取得平衡，适用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning has become a critical concern, particularly in
high-stakes applications. Existing approaches often focus on achieving full
fairness across all score ranges generated by predictive models, ensuring
fairness in both high and low-scoring populations. However, this stringent
requirement can compromise predictive performance and may not align with the
practical fairness concerns of stakeholders. In this work, we propose a novel
framework for building partially fair machine learning models, which enforce
fairness within a specific score range of interest, such as the middle range
where decisions are most contested, while maintaining flexibility in other
regions. We introduce two statistical metrics to rigorously evaluate partial
fairness within a given score range, such as the top 20%-40% of scores. To
achieve partial fairness, we propose an in-processing method by formulating the
model training problem as constrained optimization with difference-of-convex
constraints, which can be solved by an inexact difference-of-convex algorithm
(IDCA). We provide the complexity analysis of IDCA for finding a nearly KKT
point. Through numerical experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate
that our framework achieves high predictive performance while enforcing partial
fairness where it matters most.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success across scientific domains,
yet their impact in chemistry remains limited due to the absence of diverse,
large-scale, high-quality datasets that reflect the field's multifaceted
nature. We present the ChemPile, an open dataset containing over 75 billion
tokens of curated chemical data, specifically built for training and evaluating
general-purpose models in the chemical sciences. The dataset mirrors the human
learning journey through chemistry -- from educational foundations to
specialized expertise -- spanning multiple modalities and content types
including structured data in diverse chemical representations (SMILES, SELFIES,
IUPAC names, InChI, molecular renderings), scientific and educational text,
executable code, and chemical images. ChemPile integrates foundational
knowledge (textbooks, lecture notes), specialized expertise (scientific
articles and language-interfaced data), visual understanding (molecular
structures, diagrams), and advanced reasoning (problem-solving traces and code)
-- mirroring how human chemists develop expertise through diverse learning
materials and experiences. Constructed through hundreds of hours of expert
curation, the ChemPile captures both foundational concepts and domain-specific
complexity. We provide standardized training, validation, and test splits,
enabling robust benchmarking. ChemPile is openly released via HuggingFace with
a consistent API, permissive license, and detailed documentation. We hope the
ChemPile will serve as a catalyst for chemical AI, enabling the development of
the next generation of chemical foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需配对数据、编码器或预定义匹配的无监督方法，将文本嵌入从一个向量空间转换到另一个向量空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在没有监督的情况下实现文本嵌入的跨空间转换，并验证普拉提克表示假设中的通用语义结构。

Method: 通过无监督方法将嵌入转换到通用潜在表示空间，支持不同架构、参数和训练数据的模型对。

Result: 转换后的嵌入在不同模型对间实现了高余弦相似度。

Conclusion: 该方法对向量数据库的安全性有重大影响，攻击者可能通过嵌入向量提取敏感信息。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for translating text embeddings from one vector
space to another without any paired data, encoders, or predefined sets of
matches. Our unsupervised approach translates any embedding to and from a
universal latent representation (i.e., a universal semantic structure
conjectured by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis). Our translations
achieve high cosine similarity across model pairs with different architectures,
parameter counts, and training datasets.
  The ability to translate unknown embeddings into a different space while
preserving their geometry has serious implications for the security of vector
databases. An adversary with access only to embedding vectors can extract
sensitive information about the underlying documents, sufficient for
classification and attribute inference.

Conclusion: 通过截断统计为差分隐私算法设计提供通用框架，适用于更广泛的无界数据支持问题。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for differentially private (DP) statistical
estimation via data truncation, addressing a key challenge in DP estimation
when the data support is unbounded. Traditional approaches rely on
problem-specific sensitivity analysis, limiting their applicability. By
leveraging techniques from truncated statistics, we develop computationally
efficient DP estimators for exponential family distributions, including
Gaussian mean and covariance estimation, achieving near-optimal sample
complexity. Previous works on exponential families only consider bounded or
one-dimensional families. Our approach mitigates sensitivity through truncation
while carefully correcting for the introduced bias using maximum likelihood
estimation and DP stochastic gradient descent. Along the way, we establish
improved uniform convergence guarantees for the log-likelihood function of
exponential families, which may be of independent interest. Our results provide
a general blueprint for DP algorithm design via truncated statistics.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Alternator模型在时间依赖数据建模中表现优异，但缺乏对噪声项的显式建模，限制了其灵活性。

Method: Alternator++结合了Alternator损失和噪声匹配损失，显式建模潜在和观测轨迹的噪声项。

Result: 在密度估计、时间序列插补和预测任务中，Alternator++优于Mambas、ScoreGrad和Dyffusion等基线模型。

Conclusion: Alternator++通过噪声建模显著提升了性能，为时间序列分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling
time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as
state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This
paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances
the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise
terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea
of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes
the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the
noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise
trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time
series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong
baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.

Result: 实验表明，EcoL2能全面评估模型性能与碳排放成本，适用于物理信息机器学习和算子学习架构。

Conclusion: EcoL2为构建高性能且环保的科学机器学习系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world systems, from aerospace to railway engineering, are modeled with
partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the physics of the system.
Estimating robust solutions for such problems is essential. Deep learning-based
architectures, such as neural PDE solvers, have recently gained traction as a
reliable solution method. The current state of development of these approaches,
however, primarily focuses on improving accuracy. The environmental impact of
excessive computation, leading to increased carbon emissions, has largely been
overlooked. This paper introduces a carbon emission measure for a range of PDE
solvers. Our proposed metric, EcoL2, balances model accuracy with emissions
across data collection, model training, and deployment. Experiments across both
physics-informed machine learning and operator learning architectures
demonstrate that the proposed metric presents a holistic assessment of model
performance and emission cost. As such solvers grow in scale and deployment,
EcoL2 represents a step toward building performant scientific machine learning
systems with lower long-term environmental impact.

TL;DR: HybridServe是一种新型混合DNN模型服务系统，通过结合不同大小的模型（从小型到巨型）优化能源效率和推理准确性，显著降低能源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 巨型DNN模型在云端AI服务中需求巨大，但其能源消耗极高，现有方法无法同时优化能源效率和准确性。

Method: HybridServe利用多尺寸模型，基于置信度的混合服务数据流，优先使用小型模型以减少巨型DNN的副本需求，并通过数据流规划器优化模型分区和复制。

Result: 实验表明，HybridServe能源消耗降低高达19.8倍，同时保持与巨型DNN相当的准确性。

Conclusion: HybridServe在能源效率和准确性之间取得了平衡，为大规模DNN服务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Giant Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have become indispensable for accurate and
robust support of large-scale cloud based AI services. However, serving giant
DNNs is prohibitively expensive from an energy consumption viewpoint easily
exceeding that of training, due to the enormous scale of GPU clusters needed to
hold giant DNN model partitions and replicas. Existing approaches can either
optimize energy efficiency or inference accuracy but not both. To overcome this
status quo, we propose HybridServe, a novel hybrid DNN model serving system
that leverages multiple sized versions (small to giant) of the model to be
served in tandem. Through a confidence based hybrid model serving dataflow,
HybridServe prefers to serve inference requests with energy-efficient smaller
models so long as accuracy is not compromised, thereby reducing the number of
replicas needed for giant DNNs. HybridServe also features a dataflow planner
for efficient partitioning and replication of candidate models to maximize
serving system throughput. Experimental results using a prototype
implementation of HybridServe show that it reduces energy footprint by up to
19.8x compared to the state-of-the-art DNN model serving systems while matching
the accuracy of serving solely with giant DNNs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自监督学习（SSL）中维度崩溃问题，提出通过特征去相关和样本均匀分布优化表示空间维度，并分析了训练动态对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SSL中维度崩溃问题，并理解训练动态对表示空间维度的影响及其与下游性能的关系。

Method: 提出AdaDim方法，通过自适应加权特征去相关和样本均匀分布的损失函数。

Result: 最佳SSL模型在H(R)和I(R;Z)之间找到平衡点，而非极端值。

Conclusion: AdaDim方法通过动态调整损失权重，优化SSL模型的表示空间性能。

Abstract: A key factor in effective Self-Supervised learning (SSL) is preventing
dimensional collapse, which is where higher-dimensional representation spaces
span a lower-dimensional subspace. Therefore, SSL optimization strategies
involve guiding a model to produce representations ($R$) with a higher
dimensionality. Dimensionality is either optimized through a
dimension-contrastive approach that encourages feature decorrelation or through
a sample-contrastive method that promotes a uniform spread of sample
representations. Both families of SSL algorithms also utilize a projection head
that maps $R$ into a lower-dimensional embedding space $Z$. Recent work has
characterized the projection head as a filter of irrelevant features from the
SSL objective by reducing mutual information, $I(R;Z)$. Therefore, the current
literature's view is that a good SSL representation space should have a high
$H(R)$ and a low $I(R;Z)$. However, this view of the problem is lacking in
terms of an understanding of the underlying training dynamics that influences
both terms, as well as how the values of $H(R)$ and $I(R;Z)$ arrived at the end
of training reflect the downstream performance of an SSL model. We address both
gaps in the literature by demonstrating that increases in $H(R)$ due to feature
decorrelation at the start of training lead to a higher $I(R;Z)$, while
increases in $H(R)$ due to samples distributing uniformly in a high-dimensional
space at the end of training cause $I(R;Z)$ to plateau or decrease.
Furthermore, our analysis shows that the best performing SSL models do not have
the highest $H(R)$ nor the lowest $I(R;Z)$, but arrive at an optimal
intermediate point for both. We develop a method called AdaDim to exploit these
observed training dynamics by adaptively weighting between losses based on
feature decorrelation and uniform sample spread.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何有效选择参数子集以优化性能，同时减少可训练参数数量。

Method: 将子集选择建模为多任务问题，利用ε约束法和二阶泰勒近似转化为0-1背包问题，并通过Pareto最优性求解。

Result: 提出的AdaPEFT方法在不同任务和模型上表现优异，且所选子集具有跨训练范围和模型大小的可迁移性。

Conclusion: AdaPEFT通过Hessian信息指导参数选择，实现了高效且适应性强的微调。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a highly effective approach for
adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks with minimal
computational overhead. At the core, PEFT methods freeze most parameters and
only trains a small subset (say $<0.1\%$ of total parameters). Notably,
different PEFT methods select different subsets, resulting in varying levels of
performance. This variation prompts a key question: how to effectively select
the most influential subset to train?
  We formulate the subset selection as a multi-task problem: maximizing the
performance and minimizing the number of trainable parameters. We leverage a
series of transformations -- including $\epsilon$-constraint method and
second-order Taylor approximation -- to arrive at the classical 0-1 knapsack
problem, which we solve through the lens of Pareto optimality. Consequently, we
propose AdaPEFT, a Hessian-informed PEFT that adapts to various tasks and
models, in which the selected subset empirically transfers across training
horizons and model sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据增强被广泛采用，但缺乏研究分析其对神经网络模型学习模式的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效分析数据增强的影响，并识别其对模型的不同影响模式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为定量分析数据增强对神经网络模型的影响提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the last few years as an
effective tool for the task of image classification due to the impressive
performance they have achieved on this task. In image classification tasks, it
is common to use data augmentation strategies to increase the robustness of
trained networks to changes in the input images and to avoid overfitting.
Although data augmentation is a widely adopted technique, the literature lacks
a body of research analyzing the effects data augmentation methods have on the
patterns learned by neural network models working on complex datasets. The
primary objective of this work is to propose a methodology and set of metrics
that may allow a quantitative approach to analyzing the effects of data
augmentation in convolutional networks applied to image classification. An
important tool used in the proposed approach lies in the concept of class
activation maps for said models, which allow us to identify and measure the
importance these models assign to each individual pixel in an image when
executing the classification task. From these maps, we may then extract metrics
over the similarities and differences between maps generated by these models
trained on a given dataset with different data augmentation strategies.
Experiments made using this methodology suggest that the effects of these data
augmentation techniques not only can be analyzed in this way but also allow us
to identify different impact profiles over the trained models.

TL;DR: FreKoo提出了一种基于频域分析的TDG方法，通过傅里叶变换分解参数轨迹，结合Koopman算子和时间正则化，有效应对复杂概念漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TDG方法假设平滑变化，难以处理复杂漂移（如长期结构和局部不确定性），FreKoo旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用傅里叶变换将参数演化分解为不同频带，低频部分用Koopman算子学习，高频部分通过时间正则化平滑。

Result: 实验显示FreKoo在复杂漂移场景中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreKoo通过频域分析和理论支持，实现了对复杂概念漂移的鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models struggle to maintain performance in dynamic
environments where temporal distribution shifts, \emph{i.e., concept drift},
are prevalent. Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model
generalization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically
assume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts
involving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local
uncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which
tackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter
trajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter
evolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component
with dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator,
robustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and
periodicity. Simultaneously, potentially disruptive high-frequency variations
are smoothed via targeted temporal regularization, preventing overfitting to
transient noise and domain uncertainties. In addition, this dual spectral
strategy is rigorously grounded through theoretical analysis, providing
stability guarantees for the Koopman prediction, a principled Bayesian
justification for the high-frequency regularization, and culminating in a
multiscale generalization bound connecting spectral dynamics to improved
generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate FreKoo's significant
superiority over SOTA TDG approaches, particularly excelling in real-world
streaming scenarios with complex drifts and uncertainties.

Motivation: 现有对抗样本检测方法依赖外部模型或复杂架构，效率与泛化性受限，需更高效解决方案。

Method: 基于“少数层大偏移假设”，提出Recovery Testing (RT)和Logit-layer Testing (LT)两种策略，检测对抗扰动导致的内部异常。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上，标准与自适应威胁模型下均实现最优检测性能，计算开销可忽略且不影响干净数据准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、轻量且无需对抗数据，为对抗样本检测提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial
examples--subtle, imperceptible perturbations that can lead to incorrect
predictions. While detection-based defenses offer a practical alternative to
adversarial training, many existing methods depend on external models, complex
architectures, heavy augmentations, or adversarial data, limiting their
efficiency and generalizability. We introduce a lightweight, plug-in detection
framework that leverages internal layer-wise inconsistencies within the target
model itself, requiring only benign data for calibration. Our approach is
grounded in the A Few Large Shifts Assumption, which posits that adversarial
perturbations typically induce large representation shifts in a small subset of
layers. Building on this, we propose two complementary strategies--Recovery
Testing (RT) and Logit-layer Testing (LT)--to expose internal disruptions
caused by adversaries. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet under
both standard and adaptive threat models, our method achieves state-of-the-art
detection performance with negligible computational overhead and no compromise
to clean accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模和专业化的增长，高效路由变得至关重要，但现有复杂路由方法因依赖不同训练数据和评估设置而难以比较和泛化。

Method: 采用kNN方法进行路由选择，并引入一套标准化路由基准，涵盖指令遵循、问答、推理任务及多模态数据集。

Result: kNN方法在嵌入空间的局部性特性支持下，能以较低样本复杂度实现强路由决策，优于复杂学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了复杂架构的趋势，强调在投入复杂方案前应充分评估简单基线，并提供了可复现的基准和代码。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in scale and specialization,
routing--selecting the best model for a given input--has become essential for
efficient and effective deployment. While recent methods rely on complex
learned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and
evaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work,
we revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a
well-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often
outperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks
spanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as
well as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs. Our
findings reveal that the locality properties of model performance in embedding
space enable simple non-parametric methods to achieve strong routing decisions
with lower sample complexity than parametric approaches. This challenges the
prevailing trend toward sophisticated architectures and highlights the
importance of thoroughly evaluating simple baselines before investing in
complex solutions. To support reproducibility and further exploration, we will
release all benchmarks and code upon publication.

Motivation: 传统奖励塑造技术（如PBRS）在复杂、探索密集的长周期环境中效果不佳，可能导致奖励滥用或次优策略。

Method: 提出ADOPS方法，将内在奖励转换为最优性保持形式，允许动作依赖的奖励塑造。

Result: ADOPS在Montezuma's Revenge等极端稀疏环境中表现优于传统方法，且能处理非基于势能的奖励函数。

Conclusion: ADOPS通过动作依赖的奖励塑造，在复杂稀疏奖励环境中更有效地保持最优策略，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent RL research has utilized reward shaping--particularly complex shaping
rewards such as intrinsic motivation (IM)--to encourage agent exploration in
sparse-reward environments. While often effective, ``reward hacking'' can lead
to the shaping reward being optimized at the expense of the extrinsic reward,
resulting in a suboptimal policy. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS)
techniques such as Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) and Policy-Invariant
Explicit Shaping (PIES) have mitigated this. These methods allow for
implementing IM without altering optimal policies. In this work we show that
they are effectively unsuitable for complex, exploration-heavy environments
with long-duration episodes. To remedy this, we introduce Action-Dependent
Optimality Preserving Shaping (ADOPS), a method of converting intrinsic rewards
to an optimality-preserving form that allows agents to utilize IM more
effectively in the extremely sparse environment of Montezuma's Revenge. We also
prove ADOPS accommodates reward shaping functions that cannot be written in a
potential-based form: while PBRS-based methods require the cumulative
discounted intrinsic return be independent of actions, ADOPS allows for
intrinsic cumulative returns to be dependent on agents' actions while still
preserving the optimal policy set. We show how action-dependence enables
ADOPS's to preserve optimality while learning in complex, sparse-reward
environments where other methods struggle.

Motivation: 现实应用中，图数据可能包含过时、不准确或隐私敏感信息，需要高效删除。现有方法无法满足不同遗忘任务和GNN架构的需求。

Method: 提出AGU框架，灵活适应不同遗忘任务和GNN架构，确保完全遗忘删除元素并保留剩余图的完整性。

Result: 在七个真实世界图上实验表明，AGU在有效性、效率和遗忘能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGU为图遗忘任务提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph unlearning, which deletes graph elements such as nodes and edges from
trained graph neural networks (GNNs), is crucial for real-world applications
where graph data may contain outdated, inaccurate, or privacy-sensitive
information. However, existing methods often suffer from (1) incomplete or over
unlearning due to neglecting the distinct objectives of different unlearning
tasks, and (2) inaccurate identification of neighbors affected by deleted
elements across various GNN architectures. To address these limitations, we
propose AGU, a novel Adaptive Graph Unlearning framework that flexibly adapts
to diverse unlearning tasks and GNN architectures. AGU ensures the complete
forgetting of deleted elements while preserving the integrity of the remaining
graph. It also accurately identifies affected neighbors for each GNN
architecture and prioritizes important ones to enhance unlearning performance.
Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs demonstrate that AGU
outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and
unlearning capability.

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了现有挑战，提升了特征生成的效果。

Abstract: Feature generation involves creating new features from raw data to capture
complex relationships among the original features, improving model robustness
and machine learning performance. Current methods using reinforcement learning
for feature generation have made feature exploration more flexible and
efficient. However, several challenges remain: first, during feature expansion,
a large number of redundant features are generated. When removing them, current
methods only retain the best features each round, neglecting those that perform
poorly initially but could improve later. Second, the state representation used
by current methods fails to fully capture complex feature relationships. Third,
there are significant differences between discrete and continuous features in
tabular data, requiring different operations for each type. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel dual-agent reinforcement learning method for
feature generation. Two agents are designed: the first generates new features,
and the second determines whether they should be preserved. A self-attention
mechanism enhances state representation, and diverse operations distinguish
interactions between discrete and continuous features. The experimental results
on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective. The
code is available at https://github.com/extess0/DARL.

Conclusion: 潜在标记为提升LLM适应性和性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with auxiliary tokens has emerged as
a promising strategy for enhancing model performance. In this work, we
introduce a lightweight method termed latent tokens; these are dummy tokens
that may be non-interpretable in natural language but steer the autoregressive
decoding process of a Transformer-based LLM via the attention mechanism. The
proposed latent tokens can be seamlessly integrated with a pre-trained
Transformer, trained in a parameter-efficient manner, and applied flexibly at
inference time, while adding minimal complexity overhead to the existing
infrastructure of standard Transformers. We propose several hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of latent tokens and design synthetic tasks
accordingly to verify them. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method
noticeably outperforms the baselines, particularly in the out-of-distribution
generalization scenarios, highlighting its potential in improving the
adaptability of LLMs.

*Jung Hoon Lee,Sujith Vijayan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Two out of Three (ToT)'的算法，旨在帮助深度学习模型在不确定时选择不回答，以提高决策的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习的决策机制尚不明确，可能导致高风险领域的严重后果，因此需要一种方法让模型在不确定时避免错误决策。

Method: ToT算法通过生成两个额外的预测结果，结合原始预测来判断是否应该提供答案。

Result: 该方法通过模拟人类大脑对冲突信息的敏感性，增强了模型在不确定性下的决策能力。

Conclusion: ToT算法为深度学习模型在高风险领域的应用提供了一种更安全的决策机制。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) can automatically construct intelligent agents, deep
neural networks (alternatively, DL models), that can outperform humans in
certain tasks. However, the operating principles of DL remain poorly
understood, making its decisions incomprehensible. As a result, it poses a
great risk to deploy DL in high-stakes domains in which mistakes or errors may
lead to critical consequences. Here, we aim to develop an algorithm that can
help DL models make more robust decisions by allowing them to abstain from
answering when they are uncertain. Our algorithm, named `Two out of Three
(ToT)', is inspired by the sensitivity of the human brain to conflicting
information. ToT creates two alternative predictions in addition to the
original model prediction and uses the alternative predictions to decide
whether it should provide an answer or not.

*Jung Hoon Lee,Sujith Vijayan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在无线通信物理层认证中的应用，发现SNNs能高效识别设备指纹，但也易受对抗攻击，可通过自编码器增强其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习（DL）在无线通信安全中有潜力，但边缘设备资源有限。SNNs因其低功耗特性成为替代方案，本研究探索其在物理层认证中的可行性。

Method: 评估SNNs学习射频发射器独特物理属性（指纹）的能力，并测试其对对抗攻击的脆弱性，使用自编码器清除扰动以增强鲁棒性。

Result: SNNs能有效识别设备指纹，但也易受对抗攻击；自编码器可成功清除扰动，提升SNNs的抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: SNNs在物理层认证中具有潜力，但需结合防御技术（如自编码器）以应对对抗攻击。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool that can solve complex problems, and
thus, it seems natural to assume that DL can be used to enhance the security of
wireless communication. However, deploying DL models to edge devices in
wireless networks is challenging, as they require significant amounts of
computing and power resources. Notably, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are
known to be efficient in terms of power consumption, meaning they can be an
alternative platform for DL models for edge devices. In this study, we ask if
SNNs can be used in physical layer authentication. Our evaluation suggests that
SNNs can learn unique physical properties (i.e., `fingerprints') of RF
transmitters and use them to identify individual devices. Furthermore, we find
that SNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that an autoencoder
can be used clean out adversarial perturbations to harden SNNs against them.

*Tonglong Wei,Yan Lin,Zeyu Zhou,Haomin Wen,Jilin Hu,Shengnan Guo,Youfang Lin,Gao Cong,Huaiyu Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出TransferTraj模型，解决车辆GPS轨迹在跨区域和跨任务中的迁移学习问题，通过多模态整合和统一输入输出结构实现高效迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹学习模型难以跨区域和任务迁移，需维护多个专用模型且数据有限时性能不佳。

Method: 提出TransferTraj模型，包含RTTE模块（整合空间、时间、POI和路网模态）和TRIE模块（处理空间特征相对信息），并设计任务可迁移的输入输出方案。

Result: 在三个真实车辆轨迹数据集上验证了模型在任务迁移、零样本和少样本区域迁移中的有效性。

Conclusion: TransferTraj在跨区域和任务迁移中表现优异，无需重新训练即可适应不同任务。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports
various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning
model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining,
avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar
performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique
spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns
and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks
faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required
for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve
learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region
transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.
  To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS
trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability.
For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module
within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network
modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context
distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating
relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for
handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we
propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output
structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and
trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and
transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on
three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot,
and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.

*Hana Satou,Alan Mitkiy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了对抗性数据增强（ADA）在提升迁移学习中的鲁棒性和适应性中的作用，提出了一种结合ADA、一致性正则化和域不变表示学习的统一框架，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域迁移学习中分布偏移的挑战，探索对抗性扰动作为数据增强工具的潜力。

Method: 提出一个统一框架，整合对抗性数据增强（ADA）、一致性正则化和域不变表示学习。

Result: 在VisDA、DomainNet和Office-Home等数据集上，该方法在无监督和少样本域适应设置下均显著提升了目标域性能。

Conclusion: 对抗性学习可以作为一种正则化力量，提升跨域迁移能力，而非仅被视为威胁。

Abstract: Transfer learning across domains with distribution shift remains a
fundamental challenge in building robust and adaptable machine learning
systems. While adversarial perturbations are traditionally viewed as threats
that expose model vulnerabilities, recent studies suggest that they can also
serve as constructive tools for data augmentation. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of adversarial data augmentation (ADA) in
enhancing both robustness and adaptivity in transfer learning settings. We
analyze how adversarial examples, when used strategically during training,
improve domain generalization by enriching decision boundaries and reducing
overfitting to source-domain-specific features. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates ADA with consistency regularization and
domain-invariant representation learning. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets -- including VisDA, DomainNet, and Office-Home --
demonstrate that our method consistently improves target-domain performance
under both unsupervised and few-shot domain adaptation settings. Our results
highlight a constructive perspective of adversarial learning, transforming
perturbation from a destructive attack into a regularizing force for
cross-domain transferability.

*Yun-Yun Tsai,Chuan Guo,Junfeng Yang,Laurens van der Maaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过指纹识别LLM的方法，以检测模型或其输出的许可证违规行为，无需修改模型且具有高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的发布和许可证限制增多，如何识别模型或输出的违规使用成为问题。

Method: 通过生成独特的统计模式（指纹），在无需修改模型的情况下，以黑盒方式识别模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法对常见模型修改具有高鲁棒性，且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为非侵入式，能有效识别LLM的违规使用。

Abstract: AI developers are releasing large language models (LLMs) under a variety of
different licenses. Many of these licenses restrict the ways in which the
models or their outputs may be used. This raises the question how license
violations may be recognized. In particular, how can we identify that an API or
product uses (an adapted version of) a particular LLM? We present a new method
that enable model developers to perform such identification via fingerprints:
statistical patterns that are unique to the developer's model and robust to
common alterations of that model. Our method permits model identification in a
black-box setting using a limited number of queries, enabling identification of
models that can only be accessed via an API or product. The fingerprints are
non-invasive: our method does not require any changes to the model during
training, hence by design, it does not impact model quality. Empirically, we
find our method provides a high degree of robustness to common changes in the
model or inference settings. In our experiments, it substantially outperforms
prior art, including invasive methods that explicitly train watermarks into the
model.

*Yihong Huang,Chen Chu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DimGrow是一种轻量级方法，通过动态调整特征字段的嵌入维度，避免了传统方法中需要训练内存密集型SuperNet的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如剪枝或神经架构搜索（NAS）需要训练SuperNet，内存消耗大且不适用于大规模特征空间。

Method: DimGrow从每个特征字段的一个维度开始训练，通过重要性评分逐步扩展或缩减维度。

Result: 在三个推荐数据集上的实验表明，DimGrow有效且比基于SuperNet的方法节省内存。

Conclusion: DimGrow提供了一种高效且内存友好的维度分配方法。

Abstract: Key feature fields need bigger embedding dimensionality, others need smaller.
This demands automated dimension allocation. Existing approaches, such as
pruning or Neural Architecture Search (NAS), require training a
memory-intensive SuperNet that enumerates all possible dimension combinations,
which is infeasible for large feature spaces. We propose DimGrow, a lightweight
approach that eliminates the SuperNet requirement. Starting training model from
one dimension per feature field, DimGrow can progressively expand/shrink
dimensions via importance scoring. Dimensions grow only when their importance
consistently exceed a threshold, ensuring memory efficiency. Experiments on
three recommendation datasets verify the effectiveness of DimGrow while it
reduces training memory compared to SuperNet-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedGFM+是一种新颖的联邦图基础模型训练框架，通过减少知识纠缠提升跨领域适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习和图基础模型各有局限，结合二者可带来显著优势，但需解决知识纠缠问题。

Method: 提出FedGFM+框架，包含AncDAI（全局锚点初始化）和AdaDPP（本地自适应提示池）两个核心模块。

Result: 在8个多样化基准测试中优于20种基线方法。

Conclusion: FedGFM+有效解决了知识纠缠问题，提升了跨领域适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric
paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL)
enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task
heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM)
offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines,
missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable
benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM
training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where
multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering
downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core
modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based
domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes
its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors.
Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We
theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains,
providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2)
AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a
lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During
fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects
relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream
adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated
GFM variants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoVo是一种新型的主动防御技术，通过在高维嵌入向量中注入对抗性扰动来保护语音信号，有效抵御语音合成攻击和语音增强模型的干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI语音合成技术的进步，语音欺骗攻击（如语音钓鱼和假新闻）风险增加，现有防御方法效果有限。

Method: RoVo将对抗性扰动注入音频信号的高维嵌入向量中，重构为受保护的语音。

Result: 实验显示，RoVo将防御成功率（DSR）提高了70%以上，在商业语音验证API上达到99.5%的DSR。

Conclusion: RoVo在复杂威胁场景中表现优异，同时保持了语音的自然性和可用性。

Abstract: With the advancement of AI-based speech synthesis technologies such as Deep
Voice, there is an increasing risk of voice spoofing attacks, including voice
phishing and fake news, through unauthorized use of others' voices. Existing
defenses that inject adversarial perturbations directly into audio signals have
limited effectiveness, as these perturbations can easily be neutralized by
speech enhancement methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoVo
(Robust Voice), a novel proactive defense technique that injects adversarial
perturbations into high-dimensional embedding vectors of audio signals,
reconstructing them into protected speech. This approach effectively defends
against speech synthesis attacks and also provides strong resistance to speech
enhancement models, which represent a secondary attack threat.
  In extensive experiments, RoVo increased the Defense Success Rate (DSR) by
over 70% compared to unprotected speech, across four state-of-the-art speech
synthesis models. Specifically, RoVo achieved a DSR of 99.5% on a commercial
speaker-verification API, effectively neutralizing speech synthesis attack.
Moreover, RoVo's perturbations remained robust even under strong speech
enhancement conditions, outperforming traditional methods. A user study
confirmed that RoVo preserves both naturalness and usability of protected
speech, highlighting its effectiveness in complex and evolving threat
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在医疗和机器人领域有潜力，但缺乏可解释性阻碍了其应用。反事实解释能帮助理解RL决策，但在连续动作空间中研究不足。

Method: 利用连续动作的距离度量，计算替代动作序列，同时考虑预定义策略的约束。

Result: 在糖尿病控制和月球着陆两个RL领域验证了方法的有效性、效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了强化学习的可解释性和可信度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great promise in domains like
healthcare and robotics but often struggles with adoption due to its lack of
interpretability. Counterfactual explanations, which address "what if"
scenarios, provide a promising avenue for understanding RL decisions but remain
underexplored for continuous action spaces. We propose a novel approach for
generating counterfactual explanations in continuous action RL by computing
alternative action sequences that improve outcomes while minimizing deviations
from the original sequence. Our approach leverages a distance metric for
continuous actions and accounts for constraints such as adhering to predefined
policies in specific states. Evaluations in two RL domains, Diabetes Control
and Lunar Lander, demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization
of our approach, enabling more interpretable and trustworthy RL applications.

Abstract: Advances in deep generative modelling have made it increasingly plausible to
train human-level embodied agents. Yet progress has been limited by the absence
of large-scale, real-time, multi-modal, and socially interactive datasets that
reflect the sensory-motor complexity of natural environments. To address this,
we present PLAICraft, a novel data collection platform and dataset capturing
multiplayer Minecraft interactions across five time-aligned modalities: video,
game output audio, microphone input audio, mouse, and keyboard actions. Each
modality is logged with millisecond time precision, enabling the study of
synchronous, embodied behaviour in a rich, open-ended world. The dataset
comprises over 10,000 hours of gameplay from more than 10,000 global
participants.\footnote{We have done a privacy review for the public release of
an initial 200-hour subset of the dataset, with plans to release most of the
dataset over time.} Alongside the dataset, we provide an evaluation suite for
benchmarking model capabilities in object recognition, spatial awareness,
language grounding, and long-term memory. PLAICraft opens a path toward
training and evaluating agents that act fluently and purposefully in real time,
paving the way for truly embodied artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法假设源域和目标域间分布偏移较小，难以应对现实中的大偏移场景，且渐进域适应方法仅适用于IID数据。

Method: 采用Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW)距离作为域差异度量，推导误差界限，提出FGW测地线作为最优路径生成算法。

Result: 在真实数据集上，Gadget框架将图域适应方法的节点分类准确率提升高达6.8%。

Conclusion: Gadget为非IID图数据中的大偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks, despite their impressive performance, are highly
vulnerable to distribution shifts on graphs. Existing graph domain adaptation
(graph DA) methods often implicitly assume a \textit{mild} shift between source
and target graphs, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with
\textit{large} shifts. Gradual domain adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a
promising approach for addressing large shifts by gradually adapting the source
model to the target domain via a path of unlabeled intermediate domains.
Existing GDA methods exclusively focus on independent and identically
distributed (IID) data with a predefined path, leaving their extension to
\textit{non-IID graphs without a given path} an open challenge. To bridge this
gap, we present Gadget, the first GDA framework for non-IID graph data. First
(\textit{theoretical foundation}), the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance
is adopted as the domain discrepancy for non-IID graphs, based on which, we
derive an error bound revealing that the target domain error is proportional to
the length of the path. Second (\textit{optimal path}), guided by the error
bound, we identify the FGW geodesic as the optimal path, which can be
efficiently generated by our proposed algorithm. The generated path can be
seamlessly integrated with existing graph DA methods to handle large shifts on
graphs, improving state-of-the-art graph DA methods by up to 6.8\% in node
classification accuracy on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架为车载元宇宙中的AI代理迁移提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicular metaverses are an emerging paradigm that merges intelligent
transportation systems with virtual spaces, leveraging advanced digital twin
and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to seamlessly integrate vehicles,
users, and digital environments. In this paradigm, vehicular AI agents are
endowed with environment perception, decision-making, and action execution
capabilities, enabling real-time processing and analysis of multi-modal data to
provide users with customized interactive services. Since vehicular AI agents
require substantial resources for real-time decision-making, given vehicle
mobility and network dynamics conditions, the AI agents are deployed in
RoadSide Units (RSUs) with sufficient resources and dynamically migrated among
them. However, AI agent migration requires frequent data exchanges, which may
expose vehicular metaverses to potential cyber attacks. To this end, we propose
a reliable vehicular AI agent migration framework, achieving reliable dynamic
migration and efficient resource scheduling through cooperation between
vehicles and RSUs. Additionally, we design a trust evaluation model based on
the theory of planned behavior to dynamically quantify the reputation of RSUs,
thereby better accommodating the personalized trust preferences of users. We
then model the vehicular AI agent migration process as a partially observable
markov decision process and develop a Confidence-regulated Generative Diffusion
Model (CGDM) to efficiently generate AI agent migration decisions. Numerical
results demonstrate that the CGDM algorithm significantly outperforms baseline
methods in reducing system latency and enhancing robustness against cyber
attacks.

Result: 实验表明KAQ框架在精度上优于传统方法，并显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: KAQ框架为边缘设备中深度展开网络的量化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The development of edge computing places critical demands on energy-efficient
model deployment for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection tasks.
Deploying deep unfolding models such as PGD-Nets and ADMM-Nets into
resource-constrained edge devices using quantization methods is challenging.
Existing quantization methods based on quantization aware training (QAT) suffer
from performance degradation due to their reliance on parametric distribution
assumption of activations and static quantization step sizes. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel kernel-based adaptive quantization
(KAQ) framework for deep unfolding networks. By utilizing a joint kernel
density estimation (KDE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) approach to align
activation distributions between full-precision and quantized models, the need
for prior distribution assumptions is eliminated. Additionally, a dynamic step
size updating method is introduced to adjust the quantization step size based
on the channel conditions of wireless networks. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that the accuracy of proposed KAQ framework outperforms traditional
methods and successfully reduces the model's inference latency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OTA的方法，通过改进离线目标条件强化学习中的价值函数，提升长期任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线GCRL在长期任务中表现不佳，主要原因是高层策略无法生成合适的子目标，且优势信号不准确。

Method: 提出OTA方法，将时间抽象引入时间差分学习过程，改进价值更新，缩短有效视野长度。

Result: 实验表明，OTA在复杂任务（如迷宫导航和视觉机器人操作）中表现优异。

Conclusion: OTA通过优化价值函数，显著提升了离线GCRL在长期任务中的性能。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) offers a practical
learning paradigm where goal-reaching policies are trained from abundant
unlabeled (reward-free) datasets without additional environment interaction.
However, offline GCRL still struggles with long-horizon tasks, even with recent
advances that employ hierarchical policy structures, such as HIQL. By
identifying the root cause of this challenge, we observe the following
insights: First, performance bottlenecks mainly stem from the high-level
policy's inability to generate appropriate subgoals. Second, when learning the
high-level policy in the long-horizon regime, the sign of the advantage signal
frequently becomes incorrect. Thus, we argue that improving the value function
to produce a clear advantage signal for learning the high-level policy is
essential. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution:
Option-aware Temporally Abstracted value learning, dubbed OTA, which
incorporates temporal abstraction into the temporal-difference learning
process. By modifying the value update to be option-aware, the proposed
learning scheme contracts the effective horizon length, enabling better
advantage estimates even in long-horizon regimes. We experimentally show that
the high-level policy extracted using the OTA value function achieves strong
performance on complex tasks from OGBench, a recently proposed offline GCRL
benchmark, including maze navigation and visual robotic manipulation
environments.

Conclusion: EpiLLM展示了LLM在流行病预测中的潜力，为精准防控提供了新工具。

Abstract: Advanced epidemic forecasting is critical for enabling precision containment
strategies, highlighting its strategic importance for public health security.
While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
effectiveness as foundation models for domain-specific tasks, their potential
for epidemic forecasting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
introduce EpiLLM, a novel LLM-based framework tailored for spatio-temporal
epidemic forecasting. Considering the key factors in real-world epidemic
transmission: infection cases and human mobility, we introduce a dual-branch
architecture to achieve fine-grained token-level alignment between such complex
epidemic patterns and language tokens for LLM adaptation. To unleash the
multi-step forecasting and generalization potential of LLM architectures, we
propose an autoregressive modeling paradigm that reformulates the epidemic
forecasting task into next-token prediction. To further enhance LLM perception
of epidemics, we introduce spatio-temporal prompt learning techniques, which
strengthen forecasting capabilities from a data-driven perspective. Extensive
experiments show that EpiLLM significantly outperforms existing baselines on
real-world COVID-19 datasets and exhibits scaling behavior characteristic of
LLMs.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a popular tool for single source domain generalization,
which expands the source domain by generating simulated ones, improving
generalization on unseen target domains. In this work, we show that the
performance of such augmentation-based methods in the target domains
universally fluctuates during training, posing challenges in model selection
under realistic scenarios. We argue that the fluctuation stems from the
inability of the model to accumulate the knowledge learned from diverse
augmentations, exacerbating feature distortion during training. Based on this
observation, we propose a novel generalization method, coined Parameter-Space
Ensemble with Entropy Regularization (PEER), that uses a proxy model to learn
the augmented data on behalf of the main model. The main model is updated by
averaging its parameters with the proxy model, progressively accumulating
knowledge over the training steps. Maximizing the mutual information between
the output representations of the two models guides the learning process of the
proxy model, mitigating feature distortion during training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of PEER in reducing the OOD performance
fluctuation and enhancing generalization across various datasets, including
PACS, Digits, Office-Home, and VLCS. Notably, our method with simple random
augmentation achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior approaches
on sDG that utilize complex data augmentation strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了新的无监督异常检测方法，包括基于结构的Preference Isolation Forest（PIF）及其变体，以及在线数据流的Online-iForest方法，并在多个领域验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在医疗、制造和网络安全等领域至关重要，但现有方法在结构化数据和流数据场景中表现不足。

Method: 提出了PIF方法（包括Voronoi-iForest和RuzHash-iForest）用于结构化数据，Sliding-PIF用于流数据，MultiLink用于聚类；Online-iForest用于在线流数据检测；MaxLogit增强的Gradient Boosting用于网络安全。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental problem in domains such as healthcare,
manufacturing, and cybersecurity. This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods
for anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the
first part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data
follows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We
introduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a
high-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers
using two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and
RuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also
propose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming
scenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real
datasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel
method for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.
MultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust
multi-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing
approaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved
robustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses
online anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation
Forest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and
dynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time. It avoids
retraining while achieving accuracy comparable to offline models, with superior
efficiency for real-time applications. Finally, we tackle anomaly detection in
cybersecurity via open-set recognition for malware classification. We enhance a
Gradient Boosting classifier with MaxLogit to detect unseen malware families, a
method now integrated into Cleafy's production system.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视人类对多样化回答的偏好，ProDS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用直接偏好优化（DPO）和双向偏好合成策略，评分训练样本。

Result: 实验证明ProDS优于任务无关和目标导向的现有方法。

Conclusion: ProDS通过偏好对齐显著提升数据选择效果。

Abstract: Instruction data selection aims to identify a high-quality subset from the
training set that matches or exceeds the performance of the full dataset on
target tasks. Existing methods focus on the instruction-to-response mapping,
but neglect the human preference for diverse responses. In this paper, we
propose Preference-oriented Data Selection method (ProDS) that scores training
samples based on their alignment with preferences observed in the target set.
Our key innovation lies in shifting the data selection criteria from merely
estimating features for accurate response generation to explicitly aligning
training samples with human preferences in target tasks. Specifically, direct
preference optimization (DPO) is employed to estimate human preferences across
diverse responses. Besides, a bidirectional preference synthesis strategy is
designed to score training samples according to both positive preferences and
negative preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our
superiority to existing task-agnostic and targeted methods.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在投资组合优化中容易过拟合固定数据集，无法适应市场的非平稳性。

Method: MetaTrader采用双层学习框架，优化原始数据集和多样化数据转换的性能，并引入新的TD方法解决价值高估问题。

Result: 在两个公开股票数据集上，MetaTrader优于现有方法，包括强化学习和传统预测模型。

Conclusion: MetaTrader通过改进泛化性和解决价值高估问题，为投资组合优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown significant promise for sequential
portfolio optimization tasks, such as stock trading, where the objective is to
maximize cumulative returns while minimizing risks using historical data.
However, traditional RL approaches often produce policies that merely memorize
the optimal yet impractical buying and selling behaviors within the fixed
dataset. These offline policies are less generalizable as they fail to account
for the non-stationary nature of the market. Our approach, MetaTrader, frames
portfolio optimization as a new type of partial-offline RL problem and makes
two technical contributions. First, MetaTrader employs a bilevel learning
framework that explicitly trains the RL agent to improve both in-domain profits
on the original dataset and out-of-domain performance across diverse
transformations of the raw financial data. Second, our approach incorporates a
new temporal difference (TD) method that approximates worst-case TD estimates
from a batch of transformed TD targets, addressing the value overestimation
issue that is particularly challenging in scenarios with limited offline data.
Our empirical results on two public stock datasets show that MetaTrader
outperforms existing methods, including both RL-based approaches and
traditional stock prediction models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的跨变量补丁嵌入（CVPE）模块，通过修改补丁嵌入过程，将跨变量上下文注入通道独立（CI）模型，从而提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在时间序列预测中主要关注时间依赖性，忽略了变量间的复杂关系。虽然近期模型尝试通过注意力机制同时建模时间和变量依赖性，但它们完全依赖通道（CD），容易过拟合。

Method: 提出CVPE模块，通过添加可学习的位置编码和轻量级路由器注意力块到补丁嵌入层，将跨变量上下文注入CI模型。

Result: 在七个真实数据集上的实验表明，仅添加CVPE模块即可显著提升Time-LLM模型的性能。

Conclusion: CVPE模块能有效捕获跨变量依赖性，提升CI模型的预测能力，且无需其他改动。

Abstract: Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing
models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate
relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by
explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a
sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel
dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to
overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE),
a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into
channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding
process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a
lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We
then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to
demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and
enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven
real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original
baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型基准与优化策略性能相关性弱，无法准确评估奖励模型能力。

Method: 通过奖励过优化现象探索评估设计，分析其对人类偏好对齐和学习信号动态的影响。

Result: 提出构建可靠基准的三个关键发现，并指出奖励过优化程度与下游性能的相关性存在权衡。

Conclusion: 设计基准时应将奖励过优化程度作为工具而非最终目标。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a crucial role in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), aligning model behavior with human preferences. However,
existing benchmarks for reward models show a weak correlation with the
performance of optimized policies, suggesting that they fail to accurately
assess the true capabilities of RMs. To bridge this gap, we explore several
evaluation designs through the lens of reward overoptimization\textemdash a
phenomenon that captures both how well the reward model aligns with human
preferences and the dynamics of the learning signal it provides to the policy.
The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable
benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and
rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires
multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and
(iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse
representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However,
we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of
overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain
downstream performance. Thus, when designing a benchmark, it is desirable to
use the degree of overoptimization as a useful tool, rather than the end goal.

TL;DR: FedSVD通过SVD重新参数化，解决了LoRA在DP-SGD中的噪声放大问题，提升了联邦学习中的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在结合DP-SGD时面临噪声放大问题，限制了模型表达能力。

Method: 提出FedSVD，客户端仅优化B矩阵，服务器通过SVD重新参数化BA，生成新的A和B。

Result: FedSVD在隐私和非隐私场景下均优于基线方法，提升了稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: FedSVD通过SVD重新参数化有效解决了噪声问题，适用于联邦学习中的高效微调。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which introduces a product of two trainable
low-rank matrices into frozen pre-trained weights, is widely used for efficient
fine-tuning of language models in federated learning (FL). However, when
combined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA
faces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients,
and the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this
effect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model
expressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we
propose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global
reparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our
approach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the
server. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using
the previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new
adaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an
updated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components. This reparameterization
avoids quadratic noise amplification, while allowing $A$ to better capture the
principal directions of the aggregate updates. Moreover, the orthonormal
structure of $A$ bounds the gradient norms of $B$ and preserves more signal
under DP-SGD, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. As a result, FedSVD
consistently improves stability and performance across a variety of privacy
settings and benchmarks, outperforming relevant baselines under both private
and non-private regimes.

Conclusion: Koopman自编码器为理解神经网络动态提供了新视角，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores a simple question: can we model the internal
transformations of a neural network using dynamical systems theory? We
introduce Koopman autoencoders to capture how neural representations evolve
through network layers, treating these representations as states in a dynamical
system. Our approach learns a surrogate model that predicts how neural
representations transform from input to output, with two key advantages. First,
by way of lifting the original states via an autoencoder, it operates in a
linear space, making editing the dynamics straightforward. Second, it preserves
the topologies of the original representations by regularizing the autoencoding
objective. We demonstrate that these surrogate models naturally replicate the
progressive topological simplification observed in neural networks. As a
practical application, we show how our approach enables targeted class
unlearning in the Yin-Yang and MNIST classification tasks.

Conclusion: 研究为iForest的有效性提供了理论解释，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Isolation Forest (iForest) stands out as a widely-used unsupervised anomaly
detector valued for its exceptional runtime efficiency and performance on
large-scale tasks. Despite its widespread adoption, a theoretical foundation
explaining iForest's success remains unclear. This paper theoretically
investigates the conditions and extent of iForest's effectiveness by analyzing
its inductive bias through the formulation of depth functions and growth
processes. Since directly analyzing the depth function proves intractable due
to iForest's random splitting mechanism, we model the growth process of iForest
as a random walk, enabling us to derive the expected depth function using
transition probabilities. Our case studies reveal key inductive biases: iForest
exhibits lower sensitivity to central anomalies while demonstrating greater
parameter adaptability compared to $k$-Nearest Neighbor anomaly detectors. Our
study provides theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of iForest and
establishes a foundation for further theoretical exploration.

Motivation: GUI代理在执行超出能力范围或违反环境约束的OOD指令时可能导致任务失败或安全威胁，传统OOD检测方法在此领域表现不佳。

Method: 基于观察到输入语义空间的聚类特性，提出GEM方法，利用高斯混合模型拟合输入嵌入距离以界定代理能力边界。

Conclusion: GEM方法有效解决了GUI代理中的OOD检测问题，具有显著的性能提升和泛化能力。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing
paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing
user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when
encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental
constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer
task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD
detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods
perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and
evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution
input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect
to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a
novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding
distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary.
Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers,
our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the
best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our
method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available

TL;DR: FiMi-RM框架通过自主学习和纠正奖励模型中的长度偏差，解决了RLHF中的奖励黑客问题，提升了模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF中奖励模型存在长度偏差，导致模型通过生成冗长回答来最大化奖励，而非真正符合人类偏好。现有方法未能准确建模偏差形式或假设线性关系。

Method: FiMi-RM分三阶段：训练含偏差的奖励模型；用轻量级拟合模型捕捉长度与奖励的非线性关系；将关系整合到奖励模型以去偏。

Result: 实验显示FiMi-RM平衡了长度-奖励分布，提升了长度控制胜率并减少冗余，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: FiMi-RM有效建模并纠正了奖励模型的长度偏差，为RLHF提供了更精准的对齐工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on reward models to align
large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from
reward hacking, wherein policy learning exploits flaws in the trained reward
model to maximize reward scores without genuinely aligning with human
preferences. A significant example of such reward hacking is length bias, where
reward models usually favor longer responses irrespective of actual response
quality. Previous works on length bias have notable limitations, these
approaches either mitigate bias without characterizing the bias form, or simply
assume a linear length-reward relation. To accurately model the intricate
nature of length bias and facilitate more effective bias mitigation, we propose
FiMi-RM (Bias Fitting to Mitigate Length Bias of Reward Model in RLHF), a
framework that autonomously learns and corrects underlying bias patterns. Our
approach consists of three stages: First, we train a standard reward model
which inherently contains length bias. Next, we deploy a lightweight fitting
model to explicitly capture the non-linear relation between length and reward.
Finally, we incorporate this learned relation into the reward model to debias.
Experimental results demonstrate that FiMi-RM achieves a more balanced
length-reward distribution. Furthermore, when applied to alignment algorithms,
our debiased reward model improves length-controlled win rate and reduces
verbosity without compromising its performance.

Result: LoRA对后门攻击更鲁棒，但对无目标数据投毒更脆弱。

Conclusion: LoRA的低秩结构影响其安全性，需进一步优化以提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a prominent technique for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) thanks to its superb efficiency gains
over previous methods. While extensive studies have examined the performance
and structural properties of LoRA, its behavior upon training-time attacks
remain underexplored, posing significant security risks. In this paper, we
theoretically investigate the security implications of LoRA's low-rank
structure during fine-tuning, in the context of its robustness against data
poisoning and backdoor attacks. We propose an analytical framework that models
LoRA's training dynamics, employs the neural tangent kernel to simplify the
analysis of the training process, and applies information theory to establish
connections between LoRA's low rank structure and its vulnerability against
training-time attacks. Our analysis indicates that LoRA exhibits better
robustness to backdoor attacks than full fine-tuning, while becomes more
vulnerable to untargeted data poisoning due to its over-simplified information
geometry. Extensive experimental evaluations have corroborated our theoretical
findings.

Abstract: Conformal symmetries, i.e.\ coordinate transformations that preserve angles,
play a key role in many fields, including physics, mathematics, computer vision
and (geometric) machine learning. Here we build a neural network that is
equivariant under general conformal transformations. To achieve this, we lift
data from flat Euclidean space to Anti de Sitter (AdS) space. This allows us to
exploit a known correspondence between conformal transformations of flat space
and isometric transformations on the AdS space. We then build upon the fact
that such isometric transformations have been extensively studied on general
geometries in the geometric deep learning literature. We employ message-passing
layers conditioned on the proper distance, yielding a computationally efficient
framework. We validate our model on tasks from computer vision and statistical
physics, demonstrating strong performance, improved generalization capacities,
and the ability to extract conformal data such as scaling dimensions from the
trained network.

Abstract: Data Assimilation (DA) plays a critical role in atmospheric science by
reconstructing spatially continous estimates of the system state, which serves
as initial conditions for scientific analysis. While recent advances in
diffusion models have shown great potential for DA tasks, most existing
approaches remain purely data-driven and often overlook the physical laws that
govern complex atmospheric dynamics. As a result, they may yield physically
inconsistent reconstructions that impair downstream applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose PhyDA, a physics-guided diffusion framework
designed to ensure physical coherence in atmospheric data assimilation. PhyDA
introduces two key components: (1) a Physically Regularized Diffusion Objective
that integrates physical constraints into the training process by penalizing
deviations from known physical laws expressed as partial differential
equations, and (2) a Virtual Reconstruction Encoder that bridges observational
sparsity for structured latent representations, further enhancing the model's
ability to infer complete and physically coherent states. Experiments on the
ERA5 reanalysis dataset demonstrate that PhyDA achieves superior accuracy and
better physical plausibility compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results emphasize the importance of combining generative modeling with
domain-specific physical knowledge and show that PhyDA offers a promising
direction for improving real-world data assimilation systems.

Result: 实验表明TinyAlign显著降低训练损失、加速收敛，仅需40%微调数据即可达到基线性能。

Conclusion: TinyAlign为轻量级视觉语言模型开发提供了实用方法，并为理解多模态系统对齐瓶颈提供了新视角。

Abstract: Lightweight Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are indispensable for
resource-constrained applications. The prevailing approach to aligning vision
and language models involves freezing both the vision encoder and the language
model while training small connector modules. However, this strategy heavily
depends on the intrinsic capabilities of the language model, which can be
suboptimal for lightweight models with limited representational capacity. In
this work, we investigate this alignment bottleneck through the lens of mutual
information, demonstrating that the constrained capacity of the language model
inherently limits the Effective Mutual Information (EMI) between multimodal
inputs and outputs, thereby compromising alignment quality. To address this
challenge, we propose TinyAlign, a novel framework inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which strategically retrieves relevant context
from a memory bank to enrich multimodal inputs and enhance their alignment.
Extensive empirical evaluations reveal that TinyAlign significantly reduces
training loss, accelerates convergence, and enhances task performance.
Remarkably, it allows models to achieve baseline-level performance with only
40\% of the fine-tuning data, highlighting exceptional data efficiency. Our
work thus offers a practical pathway for developing more capable lightweight
VLMs while introducing a fresh theoretical lens to better understand and
address alignment bottlenecks in constrained multimodal systems.

blocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an
on-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based
pruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs. The calculated results
demonstrate that the CAP algorithm can prune 60% and 80% of the parameters for
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively, while only degrades the
performance by 3.289% and 4.693%. Considering the influence of dynamic noise in
phase shifters, our proposed CAP algorithm (performance degradation of 22.327%
for MNIST dataset and 24.019% for Fashion-MNIST dataset utilizing a poor
fabricated chip and electrical control with a standard deviation of 0.5)
exhibits strongest robustness compared with both our previously reported block
adjoint training algorithm (43.963% and 41.074%) and the covariance matrix
adaptation evolution strategy (25.757% and 32.871%), respectively. Moreover,
when 60% of the parameters are pruned, the CAP algorithm realizes 88.5%
accuracy in experiment for the simplified MNIST dataset, which is similar to
the simulation result without noise (92.1%). Additionally, we simulationally
and experimentally demonstrate that using MZIs with only internal phase
shifters to construct BONNs is an efficient way to reduce both the system area
and the required trainable parameters. Notably, our proposed CAP algorithm show
excellent potential for larger-scale network models and more complex tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sinusoidal initialization的确定性初始化方法，通过正弦函数构建结构化权重矩阵，提高了权重分布的均匀性和平衡性，从而加速收敛、提升训练稳定性和最终准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练中初始化对收敛、稳定性和泛化能力至关重要，传统随机初始化方法可能导致权重分布不均。

Method: 使用正弦函数构建结构化权重矩阵，确保权重和激活状态从一开始就均匀分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均提高了4.8%的验证准确率和20.9%的收敛速度。

Conclusion: Sinusoidal initialization为深度学习系统提供了更可靠的基础，优于传统随机初始化方法。

Abstract: Initialization plays a critical role in Deep Neural Network training,
directly influencing convergence, stability, and generalization. Common
approaches such as Glorot and He initializations rely on randomness, which can
produce uneven weight distributions across layer connections. In this paper, we
introduce the Sinusoidal initialization, a novel deterministic method that
employs sinusoidal functions to construct structured weight matrices expressly
to improve the spread and balance of weights throughout the network while
simultaneously fostering a more uniform, well-conditioned distribution of
neuron activation states from the very first forward pass. Because Sinusoidal
initialization begins with weights and activations that are already evenly and
efficiently utilized, it delivers consistently faster convergence, greater
training stability, and higher final accuracy across a wide range of models,
including convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and large
language models. On average, our experiments show an increase of 4.8 % in final
validation accuracy and 20.9 % in convergence speed. By replacing randomness
with structure, this initialization provides a stronger and more reliable
foundation for Deep Learning systems.

This problem is exacerbated in combinatorial contexts such as multi-vector

introduce Scalable Active Learning via Synthon Acquisition (SALSA): a simple
algorithm applicable to multi-vector expansion which extends pool-based active
learning to non-enumerable spaces by factoring modeling and acquisition over
synthon or fragment choices. Through experiments on ligand- and structure-based
objectives, we highlight SALSA's sample efficiency, and its ability to scale to
spaces of trillions of compounds. Further, we demonstrate application toward
multi-parameter objective design tasks on three protein targets - finding
SALSA-generated molecules have comparable chemical property profiles to known
bioactives, and exhibit greater diversity and higher scores over an
industry-leading generative approach.

Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，准确建模变量间相关性是关键，但现有方法效果有限。

Conclusion: TQNet在性能和计算成本间取得了平衡，是一种高效且准确的多元时间序列预测方法。

Abstract: Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is
crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In
this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more
effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model
performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically
shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture
global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the
raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ
technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network
(TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a
lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world
datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to
linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance
and computational cost. The code is available at:

Conclusion: RGNMR在理论和实验上均表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may
be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing
RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of
observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed
rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even
mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method,
denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$
is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a
Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On
the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions,
$\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank
matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for
factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several
simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and
in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries,
overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive abilities in numerous
domains, but exhibit inconsistent performance in response to minor input
changes. Rather than view this as a drawback, in this paper we introduce a
novel method for leveraging models' inconsistency to boost Pass@k performance.
Specifically, we present a "Variator" agent that generates k variants of a
given task and submits one candidate solution for each one. Our variant
generation approach is applicable to a wide range of domains as it is task
agnostic and compatible with free-form inputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our agent theoretically using a probabilistic model of the inconsistency
effect, and show empirically that it outperforms the baseline on the APPS
dataset. Furthermore, we establish that inconsistency persists even in frontier
reasoning models across coding and cybersecurity domains, suggesting our method
is likely to remain relevant for future model generations.

Abstract: Operator learning is a rapidly growing field that aims to approximate
nonlinear operators related to partial differential equations (PDEs) using
neural operators. These rely on discretization of input and output functions
and are, usually, expensive to train for large-scale problems at
high-resolution. Motivated by this, we present a Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC)
approach to train neural operators by leveraging a hierarchy of resolutions of
function dicretization. Our framework relies on using gradient corrections from
fewer samples of fine-resolution data to decrease the computational cost of
training while maintaining a high level accuracy. The proposed MLMC training
procedure can be applied to any architecture accepting multi-resolution data.
Our numerical experiments on a range of state-of-the-art models and test-cases
demonstrate improved computational efficiency compared to traditional
single-resolution training approaches, and highlight the existence of a Pareto
curve between accuracy and computational time, related to the number of samples
per resolution.

Conclusion: CALM-PDE为高效解决任意离散化PDE提供了一种内存和计算效率高的新方法。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using a densely
discretized spatial domain is a fundamental problem in various scientific and
engineering disciplines, including modeling climate phenomena and fluid
dynamics. However, performing these computations directly in the physical space
often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several
neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent
space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity,
they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly
sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast,
convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but
are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we
propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized
PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous
convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an
epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution
operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and
irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or
outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements
in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Inference scaling further accelerates Large Language Models (LLMs) toward
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with large-scale Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to unleash long Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Most contemporary reasoning
approaches usually rely on handcrafted rule-based reward functions. However,
the tarde-offs of exploration and exploitation in RL algorithms involves
multiple complex considerations, and the theoretical and empirical impacts of
manually designed reward functions remain insufficiently explored. In this
paper, we propose Decoupled Group Reward Optimization (DGRO), a general RL
algorithm for LLM reasoning. On the one hand, DGRO decouples the traditional
regularization coefficient into two independent hyperparameters: one scales the
policy gradient term, and the other regulates the distance from the sampling
policy. This decoupling not only enables precise control over balancing
exploration and exploitation, but also can be seamlessly extended to Online
Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) algorithms in Kimi k1.5 and Direct Reward
Optimization. On the other hand, we observe that reward variance significantly
affects both convergence speed and final model performance. We conduct both
theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation to assess DGRO,
including a detailed ablation study that investigates its performance and
optimization dynamics. Experimental results show that DGRO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Logic dataset with an average accuracy of
96.9\%, and demonstrates strong generalization across mathematical benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理未标记的野生数据时，存在模型偏向拟合OOD数据和阈值选择困难的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来提升模型的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出LoD框架，通过对未标记的野生数据故意添加标签噪声，使ID和OOD数据共同主导模型学习，并利用经典聚类技术（如K-means）过滤OOD样本。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，LoD框架在OOD检测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: LoD框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，无需依赖阈值即可实现OOD检测，提升了模型的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Using unlabeled wild data containing both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) data to improve the safety and reliability of models
has recently received increasing attention. Existing methods either design
customized losses for labeled ID and unlabeled wild data then perform joint
optimization, or first filter out OOD data from the latter then learn an OOD
detector. While achieving varying degrees of success, two potential issues
remain: (i) Labeled ID data typically dominates the learning of models,
inevitably making models tend to fit OOD data as IDs; (ii) The selection of
thresholds for identifying OOD data in unlabeled wild data usually faces
dilemma due to the unavailability of pure OOD samples. To address these issues,
we propose a novel loss-difference OOD detection framework (LoD) by
\textit{intentionally label-noisifying} unlabeled wild data. Such operations
not only enable labeled ID data and OOD data in unlabeled wild data to jointly
dominate the models' learning but also ensure the distinguishability of the
losses between ID and OOD samples in unlabeled wild data, allowing the classic
clustering technique (e.g., K-means) to filter these OOD samples without
requiring thresholds any longer. We also provide theoretical foundation for
LoD's viability, and extensive experiments verify its superiority.

Abstract: Brain-inspired computing aims to mimic cognitive functions like associative
memory, the ability to recall complete patterns from partial cues. Memristor
technology offers promising hardware for such neuromorphic systems due to its
potential for efficient in-memory analog computing. Hopfield Neural Networks
(HNNs) are a classic model for associative memory, but implementations on
conventional hardware suffer from efficiency bottlenecks, while prior
memristor-based HNNs faced challenges with vulnerability to hardware defects
due to offline training, limited storage capacity, and difficulty processing
analog patterns. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate on integrated
memristor hardware a new hardware-adaptive learning algorithm for associative
memories that significantly improves defect tolerance and capacity, and
naturally extends to scalable multilayer architectures capable of handling both
binary and continuous patterns. Our approach achieves 3x effective capacity
under 50% device faults compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, its
extension to multilayer architectures enables superlinear capacity scaling
(\(\propto N^{1.49}\ for binary patterns) and effective recalling of continuous
patterns (\propto N^{1.74}\ scaling), as compared to linear capacity scaling
for previous HNNs. It also provides flexibility to adjust capacity by tuning
hidden neurons for the same-sized patterns. By leveraging the massive
parallelism of the hardware enabled by synchronous updates, it reduces energy
by 8.8x and latency by 99.7% for 64-dimensional patterns over asynchronous
schemes, with greater improvements at scale. This promises the development of
more reliable memristor-based associative memory systems and enables new
applications research due to the significantly improved capacity, efficiency,
and flexibility.

Abstract: This study presents novel Augmented Regression Models using Neurochaos

framework are integrated with traditional regression algorithms : Linear
Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Support Vector Regression
(SVR). Our approach was evaluated using ten diverse real-life datasets and a
synthetically generated dataset of the form $y = mx + c + \epsilon$. Results
show that incorporating the Tracemean feature (mean of the chaotic neural
traces of the neurons in the NL architecture) significantly enhances regression
performance, particularly in Augmented Lasso Regression and Augmented SVR,
where six out of ten real-life datasets exhibited improved predictive accuracy.
Among the models, Augmented Chaotic Ridge Regression achieved the highest
average performance boost (11.35 %). Additionally, experiments on the simulated
dataset demonstrated that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the augmented models
consistently decreased and converged towards the Minimum Mean Squared Error
(MMSE) as the sample size increased. This work demonstrates the potential of
chaos-inspired features in regression tasks, offering a pathway to more
accurate and computationally efficient prediction models.

Abstract: It is well known that evolutionary algorithms can benefit from dynamic
choices of the key parameters that control their behavior, to adjust their
search strategy to the different stages of the optimization process. A
prominent example where dynamic parameter choices have shown a provable
super-constant speed-up is the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm
optimizing the OneMax function. While optimal parameter control policies result
in linear expected running times, this is not possible with static parameter
choices. This result has spurred a lot of interest in parameter control
policies. However, many works, in particular theoretical running time analyses,
focus on controlling one single parameter. Deriving policies for controlling
multiple parameters remains very challenging. In this work we reconsider the
problem of the $(1+(\lambda,\lambda))$ Genetic Algorithm optimizing OneMax. We
decouple its four main parameters and investigate how well state-of-the-art
deep reinforcement learning techniques can approximate good control policies.
We show that although making deep reinforcement learning learn effectively is a
challenging task, once it works, it is very powerful and is able to find
policies that outperform all previously known control policies on the same
benchmark. Based on the results found through reinforcement learning, we derive
a simple control policy that consistently outperforms the default
theory-recommended setting by $27\%$ and the irace-tuned policy, the strongest
existing control policy on this benchmark, by $13\%$, for all tested problem
sizes up to $40{,}000$.

Abstract: Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training
and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of
quantisation formats is large and the formats are often chosen empirically. In
this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of
quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the
classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of
popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using
variable-length codes. Framing the optimisation problem as minimising the KL
divergence between the original and quantised model outputs, the objective is
aligned with minimising the squared quantisation error of the model parameters.
We therefore develop and evaluate squared-error-optimal formats for known
distributions, observing significant improvement of variable-length codes over
fixed-length codes. Uniform quantisation followed by lossless compression with
a variable-length code is shown to be optimal. However, we find that commonly
used block formats and sparse outlier formats also outperform fixed-length
codes, implying they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using
the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive
the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the
model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when tested with
direct-cast quantisation of language models.

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，Fractured Sampling显著提升了准确性与成本的平衡，实现了对数线性增益。

Conclusion: Fractured Sampling为LLM推理提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling techniques have significantly bolstered the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by harnessing additional
computational effort at inference without retraining. Similarly,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and its extension, Long CoT, improve accuracy
by generating rich intermediate reasoning trajectories, but these approaches
incur substantial token costs that impede their deployment in latency-sensitive
settings. In this work, we first show that truncated CoT, which stops reasoning
before completion and directly generates the final answer, often matches full
CoT sampling while using dramatically fewer tokens. Building on this insight,
we introduce Fractured Sampling, a unified inference-time strategy that
interpolates between full CoT and solution-only sampling along three orthogonal
axes: (1) the number of reasoning trajectories, (2) the number of final
solutions per trajectory, and (3) the depth at which reasoning traces are
truncated. Through extensive experiments on five diverse reasoning benchmarks
and several model scales, we demonstrate that Fractured Sampling consistently
achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs, yielding steep log-linear scaling
gains in Pass@k versus token budget. Our analysis reveals how to allocate
computation across these dimensions to maximize performance, paving the way for
more efficient and scalable LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but
their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present
a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability
distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to
supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach
is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed
function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational
autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder
within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE
training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that
yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints
when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two
challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse
sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect
measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and
enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is
intractable without constraints.

TL;DR: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) 通过自动化配置和生成黑盒优化器减少人工设计需求，但现有方法假设问题分布固定且训练样本充足。本文提出LiBOG，一种终身学习方法，能持续学习新问题并生成高性能优化器。

Motivation: 现有MetaBBO方法假设问题分布固定且训练样本充足，但实际场景中问题分布动态变化且样本有限，需持续学习方法。

Method: 提出LiBOG，通过跨任务和任务内知识整合，避免灾难性遗忘，持续学习新问题。

Result: 实验证明LiBOG能持续生成高性能优化器，有效避免遗忘并保持学习新任务的能力。

Conclusion: LiBOG为MetaBBO提供了一种终身学习范式，解决了动态问题分布和灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) garners attention due to its success in
automating the configuration and generation of black-box optimizers,
significantly reducing the human effort required for optimizer design and
discovering optimizers with higher performance than classic human-designed
optimizers. However, existing MetaBBO methods conduct one-off training under
the assumption that a stationary problem distribution with extensive and
representative training problem samples is pre-available. This assumption is
often impractical in real-world scenarios, where diverse problems following
shifting distribution continually arise. Consequently, there is a pressing need
for methods that can continuously learn from new problems encountered
on-the-fly and progressively enhance their capabilities. In this work, we
explore a novel paradigm of lifelong learning in MetaBBO and introduce LiBOG, a
novel approach designed to learn from sequentially encountered problems and
generate high-performance optimizers for Black-Box Optimization (BBO). LiBOG
consolidates knowledge both across tasks and within tasks to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate LiBOG's
effectiveness in learning to generate high-performance optimizers in a lifelong
learning manner, addressing catastrophic forgetting while maintaining
plasticity to learn new tasks.

TL;DR: SASR是一种动态混合训练框架，结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），通过自适应调整算法优化大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（SFT和RL单独使用）存在过拟合和模式崩溃问题，静态混合方法泛化性差且依赖数据质量。

Method: SASR分阶段训练：先用SFT预热，再通过梯度范数和分布差异动态调整SFT与RL（GRPO）的混合比例。

Result: 实验表明，SASR优于单独使用SFT、RL及静态混合方法。

Conclusion: SASR通过动态平衡SFT和RL，提升模型推理能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical
problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the
models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are
respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to
mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training
schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization
across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to
these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human
reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training
framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the
two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish
basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm
based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to
seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the
training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR
ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core
reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results
demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

Motivation: 探索不同PE方案如何耦合内容和位置信息及其对模型动态的影响，填补理论空白。

Method: 通过Toeplitz矩阵的谱特性分析PE，构建合成任务对比不同PE方法，实验验证理论。

Result: RoPE在位置敏感任务中表现最佳，并诱导早期层局部化位置处理；调整PE耦合方式（如MLA）可缓解集中问题。

Conclusion: 明确内容-相对位置混合是有效PE设计的关键原则，为Transformer中位置结构集成提供新见解。

Abstract: Positional encoding (PE) is essential for enabling Transformers to model
sequential structure. However, the mechanisms by which different PE schemes
couple token content and positional information-and how these mechanisms
influence model dynamics-remain theoretically underexplored. In this work, we
present a unified framework that analyzes PE through the spectral properties of
Toeplitz and related matrices derived from attention logits. We show that
multiplicative content-position coupling-exemplified by Rotary Positional
Encoding (RoPE) via a Hadamard product with a Toeplitz matrix-induces spectral
contraction, which theoretically improves optimization stability and
efficiency. Guided by this theory, we construct synthetic tasks that contrast
content-position dependent and content-position independent settings, and
evaluate a range of PE methods. Our experiments reveal strong alignment with
theory: RoPE consistently outperforms other methods on position-sensitive tasks
and induces "single-head deposit" patterns in early layers, indicating
localized positional processing. Further analyses show that modifying the
method and timing of PE coupling, such as MLA in Deepseek-V3, can effectively
mitigate this concentration. These results establish explicit content-relative
mixing with relative-position Toeplitz signals as a key principle for effective
PE design and provide new insight into how positional structure is integrated
in Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: TSPulse是一种超紧凑的时间序列预训练模型，仅1M参数，在分类、异常检测、填补和检索任务中表现优异。通过双空间掩码重建和双嵌入解耦等创新，显著提升了性能，同时保持了高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预训练模型通常规模庞大，计算资源需求高。TSPulse旨在开发一种超紧凑模型，既能高效运行，又在多种任务中表现优异。

Method: TSPulse采用双空间掩码重建（时间和频域）和双嵌入解耦（细粒度与高层语义嵌入）。任务层面引入TSLens和多重预测头三角化技术，以及混合掩码预训练。

Result: 在UEA分类基准上提升5-16%，TSB-AD异常检测榜单上提升20%，零样本填补提升50%，时间序列检索提升25%。模型仅1M参数，比现有模型小10-100倍。

Conclusion: TSPulse通过架构和任务创新，实现了高效且高性能的时间序列预训练，为资源受限场景提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal
representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often
large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact
time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform
strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval
tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels.
At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction,
learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals.
This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both
detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic
embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic
embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is
important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens,
a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also
introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from
multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary
model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves
zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task
innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains:
5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly
detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series
retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters,
making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency
enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for
efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic flow parameters and real time identification
of congestion states are essential for the efficient operation of intelligent
transportation systems. This paper proposes a Periodic Pattern Transformer
Network (PPTNet) for traffic flow prediction, integrating periodic pattern
extraction with the Transformer architecture, coupled with a fuzzy inference
method for real-time congestion identification. Firstly, a high-precision
traffic flow dataset (Traffic Flow Dataset for China's Congested Highways and
Expressways, TF4CHE) suitable for congested highway scenarios in China is
constructed based on drone aerial imagery data. Subsequently, the proposed
PPTNet employs Fast Fourier Transform to capture multi-scale periodic patterns
and utilizes two-dimensional Inception convolutions to efficiently extract
intra and inter periodic features. A Transformer decoder dynamically models
temporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions of traffic density and
speed. Finally, congestion probabilities are calculated in real-time using the
predicted outcomes via a Mamdani fuzzy inference-based congestion
identification module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
PPTNet significantly outperforms mainstream traffic prediction methods in
prediction accuracy, and the congestion identification module effectively
identifies real-time road congestion states, verifying the superiority and
practicality of the proposed method in real-world traffic scenarios. Project

Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate
complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models
like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent
advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising
the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal
computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful
paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually
designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to
develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient
descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and
training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal
computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful
training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix
multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural
network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the
cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward
realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding
universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated
discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动选择最优混合精度配置，在保持损失低于阈值的同时最大化推理性能。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for Neural Network (NN) compression, reducing model
size and computational demands by using lower bit-width data types, though
aggressive reduction often hampers accuracy. Mixed Precision (MP) mitigates
this tradeoff by varying the numerical precision across network layers. This
study focuses on automatically selecting an optimal MP configuration within
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for inference. The first key contribution is a
novel sensitivity metric derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion of
the loss function as a function of quantization errors in weights and
activations. This metric, based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the loss, is
efficiently calculated per layer using high-precision forward and backward
passes over a small calibration dataset. The metric is additive across layers,
with low calibration memory overhead as weight optimization is unnecessary. The
second contribution is an accurate hardware-aware method for predicting MP time
gain by modeling it as additive for sequential sub-graphs. An algorithm
partitions the model graph into sequential subgraphs, measuring time gain for
each configuration using a few samples. After calibrating per-layer sensitivity
and time gain, an Integer Programming (IP) problem is formulated to maximize
time gain while keeping loss MSE below a set threshold. Memory gain and
theoretical time gain based on Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations are
also considered. Rigorous experiments on the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerator validate
the approach on several Large Language Models (LLMs).

TL;DR: OmniFC是一个模型无关的联邦聚类框架，通过编码数据共享实现隐私保护，解决了数据异构性和隐私泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦聚类（FC）需要在保护隐私的同时发现全局聚类结构，但现有方法因数据异构性和隐私泄露问题表现不佳。

Method: 利用拉格朗日编码计算，客户端仅共享编码数据，精确重构全局距离矩阵，避免隐私泄露。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，OmniFC在鲁棒性、有效性和通用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniFC为联邦聚类提供了一个统一且隐私安全的解决方案，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Federated clustering (FC) aims to discover global cluster structures across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, making privacy preservation a
fundamental requirement. There are two critical challenges: (1) privacy leakage
during collaboration, and (2) robustness degradation due to aggregation of
proxy information from non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID)
local data, leading to inaccurate or inconsistent global clustering. Existing
solutions typically rely on model-specific local proxies, which are sensitive
to data heterogeneity and inherit inductive biases from their centralized
counterparts, thus limiting robustness and generality. We propose Omni
Federated Clustering (OmniFC), a unified and model-agnostic framework.
Leveraging Lagrange coded computing, our method enables clients to share only
encoded data, allowing exact reconstruction of the global distance matrix--a
fundamental representation of sample relationships--without leaking private
information, even under client collusion. This construction is naturally
resilient to Non-IID data distributions. This approach decouples FC from
model-specific proxies, providing a unified extension mechanism applicable to
diverse centralized clustering methods. Theoretical analysis confirms both
reconstruction fidelity and privacy guarantees, while comprehensive experiments
demonstrate OmniFC's superior robustness, effectiveness, and generality across
various benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released.

Motivation: 在生存分析中估计异质性处理效应（HTEs）具有挑战性，尤其是存在时间到事件数据和删失结果时。

Method: 开发了一个包含多种正交生存学习器的工具箱，支持自定义权重函数，并与任意机器学习模型结合。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了学习器在不同低重叠情况下的有效性，包括生存重叠和删失重叠。

Conclusion: 为实践者提供了一个适用于随机和观察性研究的工具箱，支持处理删失时间到事件数据。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) is crucial for personalized
decision-making. However, this task is challenging in survival analysis, which
includes time-to-event data with censored outcomes (e.g., due to study
dropout). In this paper, we propose a toolbox of novel orthogonal survival
learners to estimate HTEs from time-to-event data under censoring. Our learners
have three main advantages: (i) we show that learners from our toolbox are
guaranteed to be orthogonal and thus come with favorable theoretical
properties; (ii) our toolbox allows for incorporating a custom weighting
function, which can lead to robustness against different types of low overlap,
and (iii) our learners are model-agnostic (i.e., they can be combined with
arbitrary machine learning models). We instantiate the learners from our
toolbox using several weighting functions and, as a result, propose various
neural orthogonal survival learners. Some of these coincide with existing
survival learners (including survival versions of the DR- and R-learner), while
others are novel and further robust w.r.t. low overlap regimes specific to the
survival setting (i.e., survival overlap and censoring overlap). We then
empirically verify the effectiveness of our learners for HTE estimation in
different low-overlap regimes through numerical experiments. In sum, we provide
practitioners with a large toolbox of learners that can be used for randomized
and observational studies with censored time-to-event data.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论框架和实验验证，成功解决了RFT中的概念漂移问题，为医学领域提供了稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper uncovers a critical yet overlooked phenomenon in multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs): detrimental concept drift within chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning during non-stationary reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where
reasoning token distributions evolve unpredictably, thereby introducing
significant biases in final predictions. To address this, we are pioneers in
establishing the theoretical bridge between concept drift theory and RFT
processes by formalizing CoT's autoregressive token streams as non-stationary
distributions undergoing arbitrary temporal shifts. Leveraging this framework,
we propose a novel counterfact-aware RFT that systematically decouples
beneficial distribution adaptation from harmful concept drift through concept
graph-empowered LLM experts generating counterfactual reasoning trajectories.
Our solution, Counterfactual Preference Optimization (CPO), enables stable RFT
in non-stationary environments, particularly within the medical domain, through
custom-tuning of counterfactual-aware preference alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our superior performance of robustness, generalization
and coordination within RFT. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmarking methodology for graph neural networks (GNNs)
based on the graph alignment problem, a combinatorial optimization task that
generalizes graph isomorphism by aligning two unlabeled graphs to maximize
overlapping edges. We frame this problem as a self-supervised learning task and
present several methods to generate graph alignment datasets using synthetic
random graphs and real-world graph datasets from multiple domains. For a given
graph dataset, we generate a family of graph alignment datasets with increasing
difficulty, allowing us to rank the performance of various architectures. Our
experiments indicate that anisotropic graph neural networks outperform standard
convolutional architectures. To further demonstrate the utility of the graph
alignment task, we show its effectiveness for unsupervised GNN pre-training,
where the learned node embeddings outperform other positional encodings on
three molecular regression tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results on the
PCQM4Mv2 dataset with significantly fewer parameters. To support
reproducibility and further research, we provide an open-source Python package
to generate graph alignment datasets and benchmark new GNN architectures.

Method: 提出一种新的两阶段学习目标，并设计了一种神经方法优化其近似目标。

Result: 理论和实验验证了新方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 首次展示如何调整两阶段CATE估计器以实现最优决策。

Abstract: Decision-making across various fields, such as medicine, heavily relies on
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). Practitioners commonly make
decisions by checking whether the estimated CATE is positive, even though the
decision-making performance of modern CATE estimators is poorly understood from
a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study optimal decision-making
based on two-stage CATE estimators (e.g., DR-learner), which are considered
state-of-the-art and widely used in practice. We prove that, while such
estimators may be optimal for estimating CATE, they can be suboptimal when used
for decision-making. Intuitively, this occurs because such estimators
prioritize CATE accuracy in regions far away from the decision boundary, which
is ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. As a remedy, we propose a novel
two-stage learning objective that retargets the CATE to balance CATE estimation
error and decision performance. We then propose a neural method that optimizes
an adaptively-smoothed approximation of our learning objective. Finally, we
confirm the effectiveness of our method both empirically and theoretically. In
sum, our work is the first to show how two-stage CATE estimators can be adapted
for optimal decision-making.

Result: 方法在三个实际任务中展示了传统时间域方法无法捕捉的、可解释的特征归因。

Conclusion: 跨域积分梯度能够为时间序列模型提供语义上有意义的解释，弥补了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight
individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's
output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically
meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain
Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method
enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an
invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our
derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain,
enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical
guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals
interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot
capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction,
electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable
plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results
demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide
semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with
traditional time-domain saliency.

mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable
transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an
undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across
geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential
relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future
samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both
$\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness
(low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative
algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and
unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We
insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which
are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments
show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast
performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter
counts drastically. Our code is available in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreeKV是一种算法-系统协同优化框架，旨在提升KV检索效率同时保持准确性，通过推测性检索和细粒度校正实现，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文窗口的部署挑战主要源于KV缓存大小随上下文长度增长，现有压缩方法存在精度损失或效率瓶颈。

Method: FreeKV结合算法层面的推测性检索与细粒度校正，以及系统层面的混合KV布局和双缓冲流式召回。

Result: 实验表明FreeKV在多种场景和模型中实现接近无损的精度，速度比现有方法快13倍。

Conclusion: FreeKV有效解决了长上下文部署中的KV检索效率问题，同时保持了高精度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding
context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long
contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache
whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression
methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur
considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant
efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization
framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the
algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV
selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with
fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs
hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data
transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve
efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy
across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup
compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.

### [731] [Why Knowledge Distillation Works in Generative Models: A Minimal Working Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13111)
*Sungmin Cha,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏（KD）在生成模型中通过权衡精确度和召回率提升学生模型性能，尤其在样本质量优先的场景中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管KD在生成模型中的实证效果显著，但其提升生成质量的机制尚不明确，本研究旨在揭示这一机制。

Method: 通过高斯混合模型的模拟实验和大规模语言模型（SmolLM2）验证KD的精确度-召回率权衡效应。

Result: 实验表明，KD使学生模型在高质量区域集中概率质量，牺牲覆盖范围，这一效应由单一熵控参数调节。

Conclusion: KD在生成模型中的有效性源于其对精确度与召回率的动态权衡，特别适用于样本质量优先的任务。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a core component in the training and
deployment of modern generative models, particularly large language models
(LLMs). While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller
student models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the
underlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly
understood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in
generative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians,
we demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and
recall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more
selective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood
regions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single
entropy-controlling parameter. We then validate this effect in a large-scale
language modeling setup using the SmolLM2 family of models. Empirical results
reveal the same precision-recall dynamics observed in simulation, where
precision corresponds to sample quality and recall to distributional coverage.
This precision-recall trade-off proves especially beneficial in scenarios where
sample quality outweighs diversity, such as instruction tuning or downstream
generation. Our analysis provides a simple and general explanation for the
effectiveness of KD in generative modeling.

*Kathrin Lammers,Valerie Vaquet,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出CFSMOTE，一种公平感知的连续SMOTE变体，通过情境测试和平衡公平相关组别，同时解决类别不平衡和公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在在线处理动态数据流中的应用增加，算法的公平性成为伦理和法律关注点。同时，类别不平衡也需要处理以确保预测性能。

Method: CFSMOTE作为预处理方法，结合情境测试和公平相关组别的平衡，避免仅优化单一公平指标。

Result: 实验表明，CFSMOTE在多个常见群体公平指标上显著优于普通C-SMOTE，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFSMOTE有效解决了类别不平衡和公平性问题，避免了单一指标优化的潜在问题。

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly applied in an online fashion to deal with
evolving data streams, the fairness of these algorithms is a matter of growing
ethical and legal concern. In many use cases, class imbalance in the data also
needs to be dealt with to ensure predictive performance. Current fairness-aware
stream learners typically attempt to solve these issues through in- or
post-processing by focusing on optimizing one specific discrimination metric,
addressing class imbalance in a separate processing step. While C-SMOTE is a
highly effective model-agnostic pre-processing approach to mitigate class
imbalance, as a side effect of this method, algorithmic bias is often
introduced.
  Therefore, we propose CFSMOTE - a fairness-aware, continuous SMOTE variant -
as a pre-processing approach to simultaneously address the class imbalance and
fairness concerns by employing situation testing and balancing
fairness-relevant groups during oversampling. Unlike other fairness-aware
stream learners, CFSMOTE is not optimizing for only one specific fairness
metric, therefore avoiding potentially problematic trade-offs. Our experiments
show significant improvement on several common group fairness metrics in
comparison to vanilla C-SMOTE while maintaining competitive performance, also
in comparison to other fairness-aware algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了机器学习中偏见放大的理论基础，揭示了标准训练如何偏向多数群体，并提出了三个关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管有越来越多的实证证据表明机器学习中存在偏见放大，但其理论基础仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过开发一个多数-少数学习任务的正式框架，分析在人口和方差不平衡的情况下，标准训练如何导致偏见。

Result: 研究发现：(i) "全数据"预测器与刻板预测器接近，(ii) 训练模型倾向于仅学习多数特征，(iii) 额外训练需求的下限。

Conclusion: 研究结果通过深度学习实验验证，为理解偏见放大提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Despite growing empirical evidence of bias amplification in machine learning,
its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. We develop a formal
framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training
can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect
minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our
analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between
``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region
where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and
(iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are
illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image
classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为μPC的方法，通过Depth-μP参数化解决了预测编码网络（PCNs）在深层网络训练中的不稳定性问题，实现了100+层网络的稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）在生物学上不现实，因此需要开发依赖局部信息的替代算法（如预测编码PC），但这些算法在深层网络训练中表现不佳。

Method: 采用Depth-μP参数化（称为μPC）来稳定PCNs的训练，解决了深层网络中的不稳定性问题。

Result: μPC成功训练了128层残差网络，在分类任务中表现优异，且支持权重和活动学习率的零样本迁移。

Conclusion: μPC为局部算法提供了新的可能性，并可扩展到卷积和Transformer架构。

Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many
alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local
information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation.
However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep
networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings.
Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for
the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can
be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023;
Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis
of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make
standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite
addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of
very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks
with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks.
Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity
learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for
other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer
architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for
PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeSy预测器假设符号条件独立，导致交互建模能力不足和泛化性能差。

Method: 提出NeSyDMs，利用离散扩散过程建模符号依赖，同时保留独立性假设以实现可扩展学习。

Result: 在合成和真实任务（如视觉路径规划和自动驾驶）中，NeSyDMs达到SOTA准确性并表现出强校准性。

Conclusion: NeSyDMs通过扩散模型有效解决了符号依赖和不确定性量化问题，为NeSy领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors combine neural perception with symbolic
reasoning to solve tasks like visual reasoning. However, standard NeSy
predictors assume conditional independence between the symbols they extract,
thus limiting their ability to model interactions and uncertainty - often
leading to overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution
generalisation. To overcome the limitations of the independence assumption, we
introduce neurosymbolic diffusion models (NeSyDMs), a new class of NeSy
predictors that use discrete diffusion to model dependencies between symbols.
Our approach reuses the independence assumption from NeSy predictors at each
step of the diffusion process, enabling scalable learning while capturing
symbol dependencies and uncertainty quantification. Across both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks - including high-dimensional visual path planning and
rule-based autonomous driving - NeSyDMs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy among
NeSy predictors and demonstrate strong calibration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了带有归一化层的深度神经网络的通用逼近定理（UAT），证明了仅由并行层归一化（PLN）和线性层组成的无限宽网络具有通用逼近能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UAT分析忽略了归一化层，而现代网络中广泛使用归一化层，因此研究带有归一化层的UAT具有重要意义。

Method: 理论证明了仅由PLN和线性层组成的无限宽网络具有通用逼近能力，并研究了单隐藏层网络逼近L-Lipchitz连续函数所需的最小神经元数量。

Result: PLN兼具激活函数和归一化功能，且在Transformer架构中替换LN时能提升性能。

Conclusion: PLN在神经网络架构中具有潜力，可作为激活函数和归一化层的双重功能组件。

Abstract: Universal approximation theorem (UAT) is a fundamental theory for deep neural
networks (DNNs), demonstrating their powerful representation capacity to
represent and approximate any function. The analyses and proofs of UAT are
based on traditional network with only linear and nonlinear activation
functions, but omitting normalization layers, which are commonly employed to
enhance the training of modern networks. This paper conducts research on UAT of
DNNs with normalization layers for the first time. We theoretically prove that
an infinitely wide network -- composed solely of parallel layer normalization
(PLN) and linear layers -- has universal approximation capacity. Additionally,
we investigate the minimum number of neurons required to approximate
$L$-Lipchitz continuous functions, with a single hidden-layer network. We
compare the approximation capacity of PLN with traditional activation functions
in theory. Different from the traditional activation functions, we identify
that PLN can act as both activation function and normalization in deep neural
networks at the same time. We also find that PLN can improve the performance
when replacing LN in transformer architectures, which reveals the potential of
PLN used in neural architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 离线强化学习（RL）的目标是从固定数据集中提取高性能策略，但现有方法在稀疏奖励和长时程任务中表现不佳。

Method: TempDATA在潜在空间中生成时间结构化的增强转换，通过学习捕捉状态空间中轨迹和转换级别时间距离的潜在抽象。

Result: 实验表明，TempDATA在多个基准任务中优于现有离线MBRL方法，甚至与基于扩散的轨迹增强和目标条件RL方法性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: TempDATA通过潜在空间的时间结构化增强转换，显著提升了离线MBRL在复杂任务中的性能。

Abstract: The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to extract a
high-performance policy from the fixed datasets, minimizing performance
degradation due to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Offline model-based RL
(MBRL) is a promising approach that ameliorates OOD issues by enriching
state-action transitions with augmentations synthesized via a learned dynamics
model. Unfortunately, seminal offline MBRL methods often struggle in
sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel MBRL
framework, dubbed Temporal Distance-Aware Transition Augmentation (TempDATA),
that generates augmented transitions in a temporally structured latent space
rather than in raw state space. To model long-horizon behavior, TempDATA learns
a latent abstraction that captures a temporal distance from both trajectory and
transition levels of state space. Our experiments confirm that TempDATA
outperforms previous offline MBRL methods and achieves matching or surpassing
the performance of diffusion-based trajectory augmentation and goal-conditioned
RL on the D4RL AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, CALVIN, and pixel-based FrankaKitchen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BFMs在动态变化环境中表现不佳，限制了其在现实世界（如机器人领域）的应用。

Method: 提出了一种改进的FB模型，结合Transformer信念估计器，并对策略编码空间进行动态特定聚类。

Result: 在动态变化环境中，该方法实现了比基线方法高2倍的零样本回报。

Conclusion: 改进的FB方法能够适应训练中观察到的动态变化，并泛化到未见过的动态环境。

Abstract: Behavioral Foundation Models (BFMs) proved successful in producing policies
for arbitrary tasks in a zero-shot manner, requiring no test-time training or
task-specific fine-tuning. Among the most promising BFMs are the ones that
estimate the successor measure learned in an unsupervised way from
task-agnostic offline data. However, these methods fail to react to changes in
the dynamics, making them inefficient under partial observability or when the
transition function changes. This hinders the applicability of BFMs in a
real-world setting, e.g., in robotics, where the dynamics can unexpectedly
change at test time. In this work, we demonstrate that Forward-Backward (FB)
representation, one of the methods from the BFM family, cannot distinguish
between distinct dynamics, leading to an interference among the latent
directions, which parametrize different policies. To address this, we propose a
FB model with a transformer-based belief estimator, which greatly facilitates
zero-shot adaptation. We also show that partitioning the policy encoding space
into dynamics-specific clusters, aligned with the context-embedding directions,
yields additional gain in performance. These traits allow our method to respond
to the dynamics observed during training and to generalize to unseen ones.
Empirically, in the changing dynamics setting, our approach achieves up to a 2x
higher zero-shot returns compared to the baselines for both discrete and
continuous tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习客户端选择策略短视，导致效率低下，需改进。

Method: RIFLES结合CNN-LSTM预测客户端可用性，提出自适应选择策略。

Result: RIFLES在准确性和测试损失等指标上提升10%-50%。

Conclusion: RIFLES首次将联邦学习建模为调度问题，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that allows decentralized collaborative model training across a set of
distributed clients, by avoiding raw data exchange. A fundamental component of
FL is the selection of a subset of clients in each round for model training by
a central server. Current selection strategies are myopic in nature in that
they are based on past or current interactions, often leading to inefficiency
issues such as straggling clients. In this paper, we address this serious
shortcoming by proposing the RIFLES approach that builds a novel availability
forecasting layer to support the client selection process. We make the
following contributions: (i) we formalise the sequential selection problem and
reduce it to a scheduling problem and show that the problem is NP-complete,
(ii) leveraging heartbeat messages from clients, RIFLES build an availability
prediction layer to support (long term) selection decisions, (iii) we propose a
novel adaptive selection strategy to support efficient learning and resource
usage. To circumvent the inherent exponential complexity, we present RIFLES, a
heuristic that leverages clients' historical availability data by using a
CNN-LSTM time series forecasting model, allowing the server to predict the
optimal participation times of clients, thereby enabling informed selection
decisions. By comparing against other FL techniques, we show that RIFLES
provide significant improvement by between 10%-50% on a variety of metrics such
as accuracy and test loss. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work
to investigate FL as a scheduling problem.

Motivation: 解决AI代理在强化学习中遇到从未意识到的未知未知状态的问题。

Method: 提出了EMDP-GA模型，采用NIVE方法扩展值函数，并使用UCB动量Q学习进行训练。

Result: 证明了方法的遗憾与SOTA一致，计算和空间复杂度也与SOTA相当。

Conclusion: 未知未知状态可以被渐近地有效发现，且成本可控。

Abstract: An AI agent might surprisingly find she has reached an unknown state which
she has never been aware of -- an unknown unknown. We mathematically ground
this scenario in reinforcement learning: an agent, after taking an action
calculated from value functions $Q$ and $V$ defined on the {\it {aware
domain}}, reaches a state out of the domain. To enable the agent to handle this
scenario, we propose an {\it episodic Markov decision {process} with growing
awareness} (EMDP-GA) model, taking a new {\it noninformative value expansion}
(NIVE) approach to expand value functions to newly aware areas: when an agent
arrives at an unknown unknown, value functions $Q$ and $V$ whereon are
initialised by noninformative beliefs -- the averaged values on the aware
domain. This design is out of respect for the complete absence of knowledge in
the newly discovered state. The upper confidence bound momentum Q-learning is
then adapted to the growing awareness for training the EMDP-GA model. We prove
that (1) the regret of our approach is asymptotically consistent with the state
of the art (SOTA) without exposure to unknown unknowns in an extremely
uncertain environment, and (2) our computational complexity and space
complexity are comparable with the SOTA -- these collectively suggest that
though an unknown unknown is surprising, it will be asymptotically properly
discovered with decent speed and an affordable cost.

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现优异，收敛快且可扩展。

Conclusion: LatentSeek是轻量、可扩展且高效的LLM推理增强方案。

Abstract: Reasoning ability, a core component of human intelligence, continues to pose
a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in the pursuit of AGI.
Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law,
significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training
algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of
novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning
performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating.
Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose
leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to
the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that
enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA)
within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy
gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated
reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks,
including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures.
Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our
analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging
within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also
benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of
test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a
lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 现有DSR方法需针对每个新系统专门训练，缺乏像LLMs那样的零样本和上下文推理能力。

Result: DynaMix在长期统计和短期预测上优于现有时间序列模型，且参数更少、推理更快。

Conclusion: 基于动态系统原理的模型在时间序列预测领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are
governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer
generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their
long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any
new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference
capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate
ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR
model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided
context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the
long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation
models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and
orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation
models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts,
even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used
for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training
corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems,
and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also
for advancing the TS prediction field.

Result: VRAdam在图像分类、语言建模等任务中表现优于AdamW等标准优化器。

Conclusion: VRAdam通过速度正则化实现了更稳定的训练和更高的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Velocity-Regularized Adam (VRAdam), a physics-inspired optimizer
for training deep neural networks that draws on ideas from quartic terms for
kinetic energy with its stabilizing effects on various system dynamics.
Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called
adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations
and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on
the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically
slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that
the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping
oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary
without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global
damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we
demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard
optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image
classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling
using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.

their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to
inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach,
\emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for
biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging
a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately
disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the
applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and
real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we
find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step
training scheme.

Motivation: 探讨正则化方法对神经网络训练的影响，尤其是为何传统方法无法收敛到完美解。

Method: 对比传统正则化方法（L1、L2、无正则化）与MDL方法在形式语言训练中的表现。

Result: MDL方法能选择完美解，不受优化算法影响，而传统方法会偏离完美初始化。

Conclusion: MDL提供了理论支持的正则化方法，能有效对抗过拟合并促进泛化。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable
solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic,
perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We
show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when
trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or
none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions
but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast,
applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model
complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization
method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations,
independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing
regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to
effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.

Result: 发现两种新的动态缩放规律，能够解释泛化能力的涌现，且在不同模型和数据集上一致。

Conclusion: 动态缩放规律为理解深度学习中的泛化能力提供了新的视角，并揭示了谱复杂度与泛化行为之间的联系。

Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning - empirical power-law relationships linking
model performance to resource growth - have emerged as simple yet striking
regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are
particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since
they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the
foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies
focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training or on the optimal training
time given the model size. In this work, we uncover a richer picture by
analyzing the entire training dynamics through the lens of spectral complexity
norms. We identify two novel dynamical scaling laws that govern how performance
evolves during training. These laws together recover the well-known test error
scaling at convergence, offering a mechanistic explanation of generalization
emergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision
Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide
analytical support using a solvable model: a single-layer perceptron trained
with binary cross-entropy. In this setting, we show that the growth of spectral
complexity driven by the implicit bias mirrors the generalization behavior
observed at fixed norm, allowing us to connect the performance dynamics to
classical learning rules in the perceptron.

Motivation: 传统PIML中，线性标量化方法仅能探索帕累托前沿的凸区域，且权重调整耗时耗力，限制了模型性能。

Method: 将训练过程重新定义为多目标优化问题，应用多种多梯度下降算法（如TMGD和DCGD）独立处理数据驱动损失和物理损失。

Result: 在宏观交通流模型中表现与传统方法相当，在微观模型中显著优于标量化方法。

Conclusion: 多目标优化方法在复杂PIML场景中具有显著优势，为模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is crucial in modern traffic flow
modeling because it combines the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven
approaches. In conventional PIML, physical information is typically
incorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven
loss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a
trade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model
predictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is
limited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats
data-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML
loss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable
trade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two
loss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by
reformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem,
treating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several
multi-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient
descent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto
front in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both
macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models. In the macroscopic case, MGDAs
achieved comparable performance to traditional linear scalarization methods.
Notably, in the microscopic case, MGDAs significantly outperformed their
scalarization-based counterparts, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-objective optimization approach in complex PIML scenarios.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模指数增长，GPU内存成为下游任务适配的瓶颈，需高效减少权重、梯度和优化器状态的内存占用。

Method: 结合零阶优化（通过权重扰动近似梯度）和模型量化（如bfloat16转int4），提出QZO方法，通过扰动连续量化尺度估计梯度，并使用定向导数裁剪稳定训练。

Result: QZO将4位LLM的总内存成本降低超过18倍，支持在单块24GB GPU上微调Llama-2-13B和Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large。

Conclusion: QZO提供了一种高效的内存优化框架，适用于大规模模型微调，显著扩展了单GPU的训练能力。

Abstract: As the size of large language models grows exponentially, GPU memory has
become a bottleneck for adapting these models to downstream tasks. In this
paper, we aim to push the limits of memory-efficient training by minimizing
memory usage on model weights, gradients, and optimizer states, within a
unified framework. Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states
using zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing
weights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize
memory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from
bfloat16 to int4. However, directly applying zeroth-order optimization to
quantized weights is infeasible due to the precision gap between discrete
weights and continuous gradients, which would otherwise require de-quantization
and re-quantization. To overcome this challenge, we propose Quantized
Zeroth-order Optimization (QZO), a novel approach that perturbs the continuous
quantization scale for gradient estimation and uses a directional derivative
clipping method to stabilize training. QZO is orthogonal to both scalar-based
and codebook-based post-training quantization methods. Compared to
full-parameter fine-tuning in bfloat16, QZO can reduce the total memory cost by
more than 18$\times$ for 4-bit LLMs, and enables fine-tuning Llama-2-13B and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large within a single 24GB GPU.

Method: RN-F是一种单次、无梯度的检测方法，利用残差信号模式，无需额外浮点运算。

Result: 在多个LLMs和数据集上测试，RN-F性能提升高达10.5%。

Conclusion: RN-F是一种轻量级、模型无关且高效的数据污染检测方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational in modern artificial
intelligence, powering a wide range of applications from code generation and
virtual assistants to scientific research and enterprise automation. However,
concerns about data contamination--where test data overlaps with training
data--have raised serious questions about the reliability of these
applications. Despite awareness of this issue, existing methods fall short in
effectively identifying or mitigating contamination. In this paper, we propose
Residual-Noise Fingerprinting (RN-F), a novel framework for detecting
contaminated data in LLMs. RN-F is a single-pass, gradient-free detection
method that leverages residual signal patterns without introducing additional
floating-point operations. Our approach is lightweight, model-agnostic, and
efficient. We evaluate RN-F on multiple LLMs across various contaminated
datasets and show that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods, achieving performance improvements of up to 10.5% in contamination
detection metrics.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AnytimeReasoner优于GRPO，显著提升训练和令牌效率。

Conclusion: AnytimeReasoner通过动态预算和密集奖励，有效提升了推理效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute is crucial for enhancing the reasoning capabilities
of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically employ
reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize a verifiable reward obtained at the end
of reasoning traces. However, such methods optimize only the final performance
under a large and fixed token budget, which hinders efficiency in both training
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel framework, AnytimeReasoner, to
optimize anytime reasoning performance, which aims to improve token efficiency
and the flexibility of reasoning under varying token budget constraints. To
achieve this, we truncate the complete thinking process to fit within sampled
token budgets from a prior distribution, compelling the model to summarize the
optimal answer for each truncated thinking for verification. This introduces
verifiable dense rewards into the reasoning process, facilitating more
effective credit assignment in RL optimization. We then optimize the thinking
and summary policies in a decoupled manner to maximize the cumulative reward.
Additionally, we introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget
Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO), to enhance the robustness and efficiency
of the learning process when reinforcing the thinking policy. Empirical results
in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms GRPO across all thinking budgets under various prior distributions,
enhancing both training and token efficiency.

Abstract: Climate-economic modeling under uncertainty presents significant
computational challenges that may limit policymakers' ability to address
climate change effectively. This paper explores neural network-based approaches
for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems arising from models that
incorporate ambiguity aversion in climate mitigation decisions. We develop a
continuous-time endogenous-growth economic model that accounts for multiple
mitigation pathways, including emission-free capital and carbon intensity
reductions. Given the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of these
models, traditional numerical methods become computationally intractable. We
benchmark several neural network architectures against finite-difference
generated solutions, evaluating their ability to capture the dynamic
interactions between uncertainty, technology transitions, and optimal climate
policy. Our findings demonstrate that appropriate neural architecture selection
significantly impacts both solution accuracy and computational efficiency when
modeling climate-economic systems under uncertainty. These methodological
advances enable more sophisticated modeling of climate policy decisions,
allowing for better representation of technology transitions and
uncertainty-critical elements for developing effective mitigation strategies in
the face of climate change.

Result: 通过Hamiltonian Neural Functional在1D和2D PDE中展示了改进的稳定性和能量守恒特性。

Conclusion: 该架构不仅适用于PDE，还可扩展至分子动力学或设计优化等领域。

Abstract: Many architectures for neural PDE surrogates have been proposed in recent
years, largely based on neural networks or operator learning. In this work, we
derive and propose a new architecture, the Neural Functional, which learns
function to scalar mappings. Its implementation leverages insights from
operator learning and neural fields, and we show the ability of neural
functionals to implicitly learn functional derivatives. For the first time,
this allows for an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to neural PDE surrogates
by learning the Hamiltonian functional and optimizing its functional
derivatives. We demonstrate that the Hamiltonian Neural Functional can be an
effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like
quantities on 1D and 2D PDEs. Beyond PDEs, functionals are prevalent in
physics; functional approximation and learning with its gradients may find
other uses, such as in molecular dynamics or design optimization.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，FlowPure在预处理盲盒和白盒场景中优于现有方法，且保持良性样本准确率。

Conclusion: FlowPure不仅高效净化对抗样本，还具有强大的对抗检测潜力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in the area, adversarial robustness remains
a critical challenge in systems employing machine learning models. The removal
of adversarial perturbations at inference time, known as adversarial
purification, has emerged as a promising defense strategy. To achieve this,
state-of-the-art methods leverage diffusion models that inject Gaussian noise
during a forward process to dilute adversarial perturbations, followed by a
denoising step to restore clean samples before classification. In this work, we
propose FlowPure, a novel purification method based on Continuous Normalizing
Flows (CNFs) trained with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to learn mappings
from adversarial examples to their clean counterparts. Unlike prior
diffusion-based approaches that rely on fixed noise processes, FlowPure can
leverage specific attack knowledge to improve robustness under known threats,
while also supporting a more general stochastic variant trained on Gaussian
perturbations for settings where such knowledge is unavailable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
purification-based defenses in preprocessor-blind and white-box scenarios, and
can do so while fully preserving benign accuracy in the former. Moreover, our
results show that not only is FlowPure a highly effective purifier but it also
holds a strong potential for adversarial detection, identifying
preprocessor-blind PGD samples with near-perfect accuracy.

Motivation: 现实数据常具有未知或近似对称性，但现有等变网络需预先固定变换群，导致性能下降。

Method: RECON利用类-姿态分解和数据驱动归一化，将任意参考系对齐到共同自然姿态，生成可比较的对称性描述符。

Result: 在2D图像基准测试中有效发现对称性，并首次扩展到3D变换群。

Conclusion: RECON为更灵活的等变建模铺平了道路。

Abstract: Real-world data often exhibits unknown or approximate symmetries, yet
existing equivariant networks must commit to a fixed transformation group prior
to training, e.g., continuous $SO(2)$ rotations. This mismatch degrades
performance when the actual data symmetries differ from those in the
transformation group. We introduce RECON, a framework to discover each input's
intrinsic symmetry distribution from unlabeled data. RECON leverages class-pose
decompositions and applies a data-driven normalization to align arbitrary
reference frames into a common natural pose, yielding directly comparable and
interpretable symmetry descriptors. We demonstrate effective symmetry discovery
on 2D image benchmarks and -- for the first time -- extend it to 3D
transformation groups, paving the way towards more flexible equivariant
modeling.

Conclusion: 开源框架为未来研究AI代理的机器学习工程能力提供了工具和基础。

Abstract: We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating
Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering
challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model
building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research
artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more
relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales
along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering
requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from
diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to
evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding
research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather
than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support
designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation
mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code,
and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based
evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with
contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications,
our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly
enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation.
We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the
ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.

Conclusion: KHRONOS在边缘计算、在线控制和计算机视觉等领域具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary models of high dimensional physical systems are constrained by
the curse of dimensionality and a reliance on dense data. We introduce KHRONOS
(Kernel Expansion Hierarchy for Reduced Order, Neural Optimized Surrogates), an
AI framework for model based, model free and model inversion tasks. KHRONOS
constructs continuously differentiable target fields with a hierarchical
composition of per-dimension kernel expansions, which are tensorized into modes
and then superposed. We evaluate KHRONOS on a canonical 2D, Poisson equation
benchmark: across 16 to 512 degrees of freedom (DoFs), it obtained L2 square
errors of 5e-4 down to 6e-10. This represents a 100 time gain over Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks (which itself reports a 100 times improvement on MLPs/PINNs
with 100 times fewer parameters) when controlling for the number of parameters.
This also represents a 1e4 times improvement in L2 square error compared to
standard linear FEM at comparable DoFs. Inference complexity is dominated by
inner products, yielding sub-millisecond full-field predictions that scale to
an arbitrary resolution. For inverse problems, KHRONOS facilitates rapid,
iterative level set recovery in only a few forward evaluations, with
sub-microsecond per sample latency. KHRONOS scalability, expressivity, and
interpretability open new avenues in constrained edge computing, online
control, computer vision, and beyond.

Conclusion: 建议未来SSL研究与预训练模型比较，并探索更深层次整合，如利用预训练知识增强伪标签。同时发布了统一的复现和评估框架。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) alleviates the cost of data labeling process
by exploiting unlabeled data, and has achieved promising results on various
tasks such as image classification. Meanwhile, the Pretrain-Finetuning paradigm
has garnered significant attention in recent years, and exploiting pre-trained
models could also reduce the requirement of labeled data in downstream tasks.
Therefore, a question naturally occurs: \emph{When the labeled data is scarce
in the target tasks, should we exploit unlabeled data or pre-trained models?}
To answer this question, we select pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as
representative pretrain-finetuning instances and propose \textit{Few-shot SSL}
-- a framework that enables fair comparison between these two paradigms by
controlling the amount of labeled data used. Extensive experiments across
various settings demonstrate that pre-trained VLMs generally outperform SSL
methods in nearly all cases, except when the data has low resolution or lacks
clear semantic structure. Therefore, we encourage future SSL research to
compare with pre-trained models and explore deeper integration, such as using
pre-trained knowledge to enhance pseudo-labeling. To support future research,
we release our unified reproduction and evaluation framework. Codes are

Motivation: 现有方法在结合多推理分支和链式思考时，导致效率显著下降，包括时间成本增加和内存消耗过高。

Method: 提出SART框架，采用冗余采样与提前停止策略生成短思考响应，并动态修剪低质量分支以减少内存占用。

Result: 实验显示SART在保持相同准确性的情况下，效率提升高达28.2倍，平均15.7倍。

Conclusion: SART有效解决了多推理分支和链式思考带来的效率问题，显著提升了LLM的服务性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling suggest that Large Language Models
(LLMs) can gain better capabilities by generating Chain-of-Thought reasoning
(analogous to human thinking) to respond a given request, and meanwhile
exploring more reasoning branches (i.e., generating multiple responses and
ensembling them) can improve the final output quality. However, when
incorporating the two scaling dimensions, we find that the system efficiency is
dampened significantly for two reasons. Firstly, the time cost to generate the
final output increases substantially as many reasoning branches would be
trapped in the over-thinking dilemma, producing excessively long responses.
Secondly, generating multiple reasoning branches for each request increases
memory consumption, which is unsuitable for LLM serving since we can only batch
a limited number of requests to process simultaneously. To address this, we
present SART, a serving framework for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning. The
essential idea is to manage the thinking to be short and right, rather than
long. For one thing, we devise a redundant sampling with early stopping
approach based on empirical observations and theoretic analysis, which
increases the likelihood of obtaining short-thinking responses when sampling
reasoning branches. For another, we propose to dynamically prune low-quality
branches so that only right-thinking branches are maintained, reducing the
memory consumption and allowing us to batch more requests. Experimental results
demonstrate that SART not only improves the accuracy of LLM reasoning but also
enhances the serving efficiency, outperforming existing methods by up to 28.2
times and on average 15.7 times in terms of efficiency when achieving the same
level of accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法通过保留噪声样本中的有价值信息并优化校正过程，实现了更鲁棒的学习和模型性能提升。

Abstract: Falsely annotated samples, also known as noisy labels, can significantly harm
the performance of deep learning models. Two main approaches for learning with
noisy labels are global noise estimation and data filtering. Global noise
estimation approximates the noise across the entire dataset using a noise
transition matrix, but it can unnecessarily adjust correct labels, leaving room
for local improvements. Data filtering, on the other hand, discards potentially
noisy samples but risks losing valuable data. Our method identifies potentially
noisy samples based on their loss distribution. We then apply a selection
process to separate noisy and clean samples and learn a noise transition matrix
to correct the loss for noisy samples while leaving the clean data unaffected,
thereby improving the training process. Our approach ensures robust learning
and enhanced model performance by preserving valuable information from noisy
samples and refining the correction process. We applied our method to standard
image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) and a biological scRNA-seq
cell-type annotation dataset. We observed a significant improvement in model
accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型复杂性和数量的增长，结构化且机器可读的元数据对开发者和公司至关重要，同时需包含环境影响指标。

Method: 定义了一种结构化元数据模式，支持知识图谱集成，并提供了一个无线定位模型的元数据示例数据集。

Conclusion: 结构化元数据方案和知识图谱集成提升了模型的组织和查询能力，扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: As the complexity and number of machine learning (ML) models grows,
well-documented ML models are essential for developers and companies to use or
adapt them to their specific use cases. Model metadata, already present in
unstructured format as model cards in online repositories such as Hugging Face,
could be more structured and machine readable while also incorporating
environmental impact metrics such as energy consumption and carbon footprint.
Our work extends the existing State of the Art by defining a structured schema
for ML model metadata focusing on machine-readable format and support for
integration into a knowledge graph (KG) for better organization and querying,
enabling a wider set of use cases. Furthermore, we present an example wireless
localization model metadata dataset consisting of 22 models trained on 4
datasets, integrated into a Neo4j-based KG with 113 nodes and 199 relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构中的全设备通信开销大（占运行时40%以上），限制了其扩展性。

Method: 定义协作通信，提出系统与算法创新（如协作剪枝和优化），减少通信成本。

Result: Occult在多个MoE-LLM上实现1.5倍加速，性能与标准微调相当或更优。

Conclusion: Occult有效降低通信开销，显著提升MoE模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures could achieve impressive computational
efficiency with expert parallelism, which relies heavily on all-to-all
communication across devices. Unfortunately, such communication overhead
typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the
scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models
(consuming over $40\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we
first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic
limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce
communication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one
token, we call them "collaborated", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and
inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our
pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of
intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us
to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE
training and inference, dubbed Occult. Our designs are capable of either
delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably
minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified
fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that
Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training
frameworks (more than $1.5\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models)
with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Koopman理论的离线蒸馏方法KDM，用于加速扩散模型的生成过程，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，而离线蒸馏具有效率、模块化和灵活性优势。论文发现扩散模型的动态系统视角和潜在空间的结构化轨迹可进一步优化。

Method: KDM利用Koopman理论将非线性动态线性化，通过编码器将噪声输入映射到嵌入空间，线性算子传播后解码生成干净样本，实现单步生成。

Result: KDM在标准离线蒸馏基准测试中表现优异，单步生成FID分数提升高达40%。

Conclusion: KDM为扩散模型提供了一种高效且语义保真的蒸馏框架，理论支持其有限维Koopman表示和潜在空间语义相关性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional performance,
yet their iterative sampling procedures remain computationally expensive. A
prominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline
distillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity,
and flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a
principled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed
through the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools
can be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose
structured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on
these observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel
offline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework
for representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM
encodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator
propagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples.
This enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions,
the learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman
representation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with
semantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory
alignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across
standard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in
a single generation step. All implementation details and code for the
experimental setups are provided in our GitHub -

*Yasi Zhang,Tianyu Chen,Zhendong Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Mingyuan Zhou,Oscar Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Restoration Score Distillation (RSD)的方法，通过从噪声数据中训练生成模型，并扩展了Denoising Score Distillation (DSD)的能力，适用于更广泛的损坏类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学领域，从损坏数据中学习生成模型是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，尤其是当干净数据难以获取时。

Method: RSD通过预训练一个教师扩散模型（仅使用损坏数据），然后将其蒸馏为单步生成器，以生成高质量重建。

Result: 实验表明，RSD在多种恢复任务中优于其教师模型，并与多种损坏感知训练技术兼容。

Conclusion: RSD不仅是一种采样加速技术，还能在严重损坏数据场景下提升生成性能。

Abstract: Learning generative models from corrupted data is a fundamental yet
persistently challenging task across scientific disciplines, particularly when
access to clean data is limited or expensive. Denoising Score Distillation
(DSD) \cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly
effective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity
generative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this
foundation, we propose \textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a
principled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of
corruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD
operates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted
data and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces
high-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its
teacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific
datasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is
compatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient
Tweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible
integration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean
data covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit
regularizer. This interpretation recasts score distillation not only as a
sampling acceleration technique but as a principled approach to enhancing
generative performance in severely degraded data regimes.

Method: 引入平均速度概念，推导其与瞬时速度的恒等式，并用于指导神经网络训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，单次评估FID达3.43，显著优于现有单步模型。

Conclusion: MeanFlow显著缩小了单步与多步模型的差距，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative
modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow
fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods.
A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived
and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow
model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or
curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it
achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet
256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous
state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially
narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step
predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the
foundations of these powerful models.

Method: 评估高阶RK方法在深度学习中的性能，研究其局限性，并提出改进方法，如结合预条件、自适应学习率和动量。

Result: 高阶RK方法在深度学习中有潜力，但需结合现代优化器的关键要素以提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过改进高阶RK方法，可以提升其在深度学习中的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Modern deep learning algorithms use variations of gradient descent as their
main learning methods. Gradient descent can be understood as the simplest
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver; namely, the Euler method applied
to the gradient flow differential equation. Since Euler, many ODE solvers have
been devised that follow the gradient flow equation more precisely and more
stably. Runge-Kutta (RK) methods provide a family of very powerful explicit and
implicit high-order ODE solvers. However, these higher-order solvers have not
found wide application in deep learning so far. In this work, we evaluate the
performance of higher-order RK solvers when applied in deep learning, study
their limitations, and propose ways to overcome these drawbacks. In particular,
we explore how to improve their performance by naturally incorporating key
ingredients of modern neural network optimizers such as preconditioning,
adaptive learning rates, and momentum.

Motivation: MaxCut问题的NP难特性使得传统启发式算法依赖专家知识，而基于学习的方法泛化性和扩展性不足。

Method: 通过非周期性强化学习（MDP）优化超平面选择，替代GW算法的随机舍入。

Result: 在大规模不同密度和度分布的图上，该方法一致获得更好的切割结果。

Conclusion: 强化学习可有效改进MaxCut问题的近似解，无需训练数据。

Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal
solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms
are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain
expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled
datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with
generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for
MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite
program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly
sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node
assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a
non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to
select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced
by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our
method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying
densities and degree distributions.

Conclusion: VGFM为单细胞动态建模提供了有效工具，尤其适用于非配对和不平衡数据。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics of single cells from snapshot data has
gained increasing attention in scientific and machine learning research. The
destructive measurement technique and cell proliferation/death result in
unpaired and unbalanced data between snapshots, making the learning of the
underlying dynamics challenging. In this paper, we propose joint
Velocity-Growth Flow Matching (VGFM), a novel paradigm that jointly learns
state transition and mass growth of single-cell populations via flow matching.
VGFM builds an ideal single-cell dynamics containing velocity of state and
growth of mass, driven by a presented two-period dynamic understanding of the
static semi-relaxed optimal transport, a mathematical tool that seeks the
coupling between unpaired and unbalanced data. To enable practical usage, we
approximate the ideal dynamics using neural networks, forming our joint
velocity and growth matching framework. A distribution fitting loss is also
employed in VGFM to further improve the fitting performance for snapshot data.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate
that VGFM can capture the underlying biological dynamics accounting for mass
and state variations over time, outperforming existing approaches for
single-cell dynamics modeling.

Motivation: 现有LMO优化方法（如Muon和Scion）在实践中有优势，但理论分析存在不足，如忽略层间LMO应用和不现实的平滑假设。

Result: 理论步长与实际调优值一致，实验验证了假设的有效性。

Conclusion: Gluon成功缩小了理论与实践之间的差距，为大规模任务提供了更可靠的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in deep learning optimization have brought about
radically new algorithms based on the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO)
framework, such as $\sf Muon$ and $\sf Scion$. After over a decade of $\sf
Adam$'s dominance, these LMO-based methods are emerging as viable replacements,
offering several practical advantages such as improved memory efficiency,
better hyperparameter transferability, and most importantly, superior empirical
performance on large-scale tasks, including LLM training. However, a
significant gap remains between their practical use and our current theoretical
understanding: prior analyses (1) overlook the layer-wise LMO application of
these optimizers in practice, and (2) rely on an unrealistic smoothness
assumption, leading to impractically small stepsizes. To address both, we
propose a new LMO-based method called $\sf Gluon$, capturing prior
theoretically analyzed methods as special cases, and introduce a new refined
generalized smoothness model that captures the layer-wise geometry of neural
networks, matches the layer-wise practical implementation of $\sf Muon$ and
$\sf Scion$, and leads to convergence guarantees with strong practical
predictive power. Unlike prior results, our theoretical stepsizes closely match
the fine-tuned values reported by Pethick et al. (2025). Our experiments with
NanoGPT and CNN confirm that our assumption holds along the optimization
trajectory, ultimately closing the gap between theory and practice.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种表格数据集上优于基准模型和标准集成技术。

Conclusion: 动态上下文集成框架结合LLMs，显著提升表格预测性能，接近专家决策水平。

Abstract: Tabular data, a fundamental data format in machine learning, is predominantly
utilized in competitions and real-world applications. The performance of
tabular models--such as gradient boosted decision trees and neural
networks--can vary significantly across datasets due to differences in feature
distributions and task characteristics. Achieving top performance on each
dataset often requires specialized expert knowledge. To address this
variability, practitioners often aggregate the predictions of multiple models.
However, conventional aggregation strategies typically rely on static
combination rules and lack instance-level adaptability. In this work, we
propose an in-context ensemble framework for tabular prediction that leverages
large language models (LLMs) to perform dynamic, instance-specific integration
of external model predictions. Without access to raw tabular features or
semantic information, our method constructs a context around each test instance
using its nearest neighbors and the predictions from a pool of external models.
Within this enriched context, we introduce Chain of Tabular Thoughts (CoT$^2$),
a prompting strategy that guides LLMs through multi-step, interpretable
reasoning, making still further progress toward expert-level decision-making.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms well-tuned baselines and
standard ensemble techniques across a wide range of tabular datasets.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在专业场景中的数据稀缺、隐私和高计算成本问题，同时探索learnware范式在语言模型中的应用潜力。

Method: 构建包含约100个8B参数SLMs的learnware系统，覆盖金融、医疗和数学领域，每个learnware包含模型和描述其能力的规范。

Result: 系统在任务特定推理中表现优异，金融领域任务超越多个LLMs至少14%，医疗领域任务超越Flan-PaLM-540B。

Conclusion: learnware范式为语言模型提供了一种高效、隐私保护的解决方案，展示了其在专业领域的潜力。

Abstract: The learnware paradigm offers a novel approach to machine learning by
enabling users to reuse a set of well-trained models for tasks beyond the
models' original purposes. It eliminates the need to build models from scratch,
instead relying on specifications (representations of a model's capabilities)
to identify and leverage the most suitable models for new tasks. While
learnware has proven effective in many scenarios, its application to language
models has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet
they face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small
language models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these
limitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising
solution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing
users to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving
manner.
  This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to
language models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100
learnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance,
healthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a
specification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without
exposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising
performance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific
inference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks. Compared to
LLMs, the system outperforms Qwen1.5-110B, Qwen2.5-72B, and
Llama3.1-70B-Instruct by at least 14% in finance domain tasks, and surpasses
Flan-PaLM-540B (ranked 7th on the Open Medical LLM Leaderboard) in medical
domain tasks.

Conclusion: SPPI无需数据分布假设，提供更紧且信息丰富的预测集。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a framework for predictive inference with a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee. However, it tends to provide
uninformative prediction sets when calibration data are scarce. This paper
introduces Synthetic-powered predictive inference (SPPI), a novel framework
that incorporates synthetic data -- e.g., from a generative model -- to improve
sample efficiency. At the core of our method is a score transporter: an
empirical quantile mapping that aligns nonconformity scores from trusted, real
data with those from synthetic data. By carefully integrating the score
transporter into the calibration process, SPPI provably achieves finite-sample
coverage guarantees without making any assumptions about the real and synthetic
data distributions. When the score distributions are well aligned, SPPI yields
substantially tighter and more informative prediction sets than standard
conformal prediction. Experiments on image classification and tabular
regression demonstrate notable improvements in predictive efficiency in
data-scarce settings.

Abstract: Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing
speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to
surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication
in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first
non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines,
raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven
by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with
LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary
B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective
vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale
non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and
improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we
offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size.
Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical
non-invasive B2T systems.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GenAI时代数据共享的经济机制，为平台、监管者和政策制定者提供了设计有效数据交换机制的指导。

Abstract: As GenAI platforms grow, their dependence on content from competing
providers, combined with access to alternative data sources, creates new
challenges for data-sharing decisions. In this paper, we provide a model of
data sharing between a content creation firm and a GenAI platform that can also
acquire content from third-party experts. The interaction is modeled as a
Stackelberg game: the firm first decides how much of its proprietary dataset to
share with GenAI, and GenAI subsequently determines how much additional data to
acquire from external experts. Their utilities depend on user traffic, monetary
transfers, and the cost of acquiring additional data from external experts. We
characterize the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and uncover a
surprising phenomenon: The firm may be willing to pay GenAI to share the firm's
own data, leading to a costly data-sharing equilibrium. We further characterize
the set of Pareto improving data prices, and show that such improvements occur
only when the firm pays to share data. Finally, we study how the price can be
set to optimize different design objectives, such as promoting firm data
sharing, expert data acquisition, or a balance of both. Our results shed light
on the economic forces shaping data-sharing partnerships in the age of GenAI,
and provide guidance for platforms, regulators and policymakers seeking to
design effective data exchange mechanisms.

Result: 实验表明，两种机制在真实数据集上快速收敛，提供良好福利保障和模型性能。

Abstract: Classical federated learning (FL) assumes that the clients have a limited
amount of noisy data with which they voluntarily participate and contribute
towards learning a global, more accurate model in a principled manner. The
learning happens in a distributed fashion without sharing the data with the
center. However, these methods do not consider the incentive of an agent for
participating and contributing to the process, given that data collection and
running a distributed algorithm is costly for the clients. The question of
rationality of contribution has been asked recently in the literature and some
results exist that consider this problem. This paper addresses the question of
simultaneous parameter learning and incentivizing contribution, which
distinguishes it from the extant literature. Our first mechanism incentivizes
each client to contribute to the FL process at a Nash equilibrium and
simultaneously learn the model parameters. However, this equilibrium outcome
can be away from the optimal, where clients contribute with their full data and
the algorithm learns the optimal parameters. We propose a second mechanism with
monetary transfers that is budget balanced and enables the full data
contribution along with optimal parameter learning. Large scale experiments
with real (federated) datasets (CIFAR-10, FeMNIST, and Twitter) show that these
algorithms converge quite fast in practice, yield good welfare guarantees, and
better model performance for all agents.

Motivation: 探索哈密顿动力学在博弈学习动态中的结构特性，为博弈论和机器学习提供新视角。

Method: 将策略和收益作为共轭变量构建哈密顿函数，分析其对称性，并提出DFTRL动态以引入扰动。

Result: 揭示了概率守恒和Fenchel耦合不变性的内在联系，证明DFTRL能收敛至纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 哈密顿动力学为博弈学习动态的结构分析提供了新工具，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Understanding a dynamical system fundamentally relies on establishing an
appropriate Hamiltonian function and elucidating its symmetries. By formulating
agents' strategies and cumulative payoffs as canonically conjugate variables,
we identify the Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics of poly-matrix
zero-sum games. We reveal the symmetries of our Hamiltonian and derive the
associated conserved quantities, showing how the conservation of probability
and the invariance of the Fenchel coupling are intrinsically encoded within the
system. Furthermore, we propose the dissipation FTRL (DFTRL) dynamics by
introducing a perturbation that dissipates the Fenchel coupling, proving
convergence to the Nash equilibrium and linking DFTRL to last-iterate
convergent algorithms. Our results highlight the potential of Hamiltonian
dynamics in uncovering the structural properties of learning dynamics in games,
and pave the way for broader applications of Hamiltonian dynamics in game
theory and machine learning.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型向量数据库HAKES，通过两阶段索引设计和轻量级机器学习优化，解决了现有图索引在高并发读写场景下的性能问题，实现了高召回率和高吞吐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图索引在构建成本、并发读写竞争和多服务器扩展性方面表现不佳，需要一种更高效的向量数据库解决方案。

Method: 设计了两阶段ANN索引（快速过滤+精确细化），引入轻量级机器学习调整参数，动态搜索终止检查，并支持写入操作。最后构建了分布式向量数据库HAKES。

Result: 实验表明，新索引在高召回率和并发读写场景下优于12种现有索引，HAKES的吞吐量最高提升16倍。

Conclusion: HAKES通过创新设计和分布式架构，显著提升了向量数据库的性能和扩展性，已开源。

Abstract: Modern deep learning models capture the semantics of complex data by
transforming them into high-dimensional embedding vectors. Emerging
applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation, use approximate nearest
neighbor (ANN) search in the embedding vector space to find similar data.
Existing vector databases provide indexes for efficient ANN searches, with
graph-based indexes being the most popular due to their low latency and high
recall in real-world high-dimensional datasets. However, these indexes are
costly to build, suffer from significant contention under concurrent read-write
workloads, and scale poorly to multiple servers.
  Our goal is to build a vector database that achieves high throughput and high
recall under concurrent read-write workloads. To this end, we first propose an
ANN index with an explicit two-stage design combining a fast filter stage with
highly compressed vectors and a refine stage to ensure recall, and we devise a
novel lightweight machine learning technique to fine-tune the index parameters.
We introduce an early termination check to dynamically adapt the search process
for each query. Next, we add support for writes while maintaining search
performance by decoupling the management of the learned parameters. Finally, we
design HAKES, a distributed vector database that serves the new index in a
disaggregated architecture. We evaluate our index and system against 12
state-of-the-art indexes and three distributed vector databases, using
high-dimensional embedding datasets generated by deep learning models. The
experimental results show that our index outperforms index baselines in the
high recall region and under concurrent read-write workloads. Furthermore,
\namesys{} is scalable and achieves up to $16\times$ higher throughputs than
the baselines. The HAKES project is open-sourced at

*Hanfang Cui,Longfei Song,Li Li,Dongxing Xu,Yanhua Long*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了自监督学习（SSL）模型在声音事件检测（SED）中的应用，提出了一种融合多种SSL表征的框架，并通过实验验证了双模态融合的互补性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督学习模型在声音事件检测中的协同潜力，指导模型选择和集成。

Method: 提出融合多种SSL表征的框架，包括个体SSL嵌入集成、双模态融合和完全聚合，并引入自适应后处理方法nSEBBs。

Result: 双模态融合（如CRNN+BEATs+WavLM）表现互补性能提升，CRNN+BEATs在单独SSL模型中表现最佳；nSEBBs提升PSDS1达4%。

Conclusion: SSL架构具有兼容性和互补性，为任务特定融合和稳健SED系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models offer powerful representations for
sound event detection (SED), yet their synergistic potential remains
underexplored. This study systematically evaluates state-of-the-art SSL models
to guide optimal model selection and integration for SED. We propose a
framework that combines heterogeneous SSL representations (e.g., BEATs, HuBERT,
WavLM) through three fusion strategies: individual SSL embedding integration,
dual-modal fusion, and full aggregation. Experiments on the DCASE 2023 Task 4
Challenge reveal that dual-modal fusion (e.g., CRNN+BEATs+WavLM) achieves
complementary performance gains, while CRNN+BEATs alone delivers the best
results among individual SSL models. We further introduce normalized sound
event bounding boxes (nSEBBs), an adaptive post-processing method that
dynamically adjusts event boundary predictions, improving PSDS1 by up to 4% for
standalone SSL models. These findings highlight the compatibility and
complementarity of SSL architectures, providing guidance for task-specific
fusion and robust SED system design.

TL;DR: 提出了一种浅层流匹配（SFM）机制，通过粗到细生成范式增强基于流匹配（FM）的文本到语音（TTS）模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进FM-based TTS模型的自然度和推理效率。

Method: SFM利用粗输出表示构建FM路径的中间状态，训练时采用正交投影方法自适应确定状态位置，并基于单段分段流进行构建。推理时从中间状态开始，聚焦于FM路径的后段。

Result: SFM显著提升了合成语音的自然度，并减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: SFM是一种轻量级且高效的改进方法，适用于多种TTS模型。

Abstract: We propose a shallow flow matching (SFM) mechanism to enhance flow matching
(FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation
paradigm. SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths using coarse
output representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection
method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply
a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow.
The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise and
focuses computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into
multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments show that SFM
consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech in both objective
and subjective evaluations, while significantly reducing inference when using
adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注 LALMs 在语音和音频处理任务中的表现，但其多跳推理能力缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 引入 SAKURA 基准测试，专门评估 LALMs 基于语音和音频信息的多跳推理能力。

Result: LALMs 即使能正确提取相关信息，也难以整合语音/音频表示进行多跳推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了 LALMs 在多模态推理中的关键局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend the large language models with
multimodal understanding in speech, audio, etc. While their performances on
speech and audio-processing tasks are extensively studied, their reasoning
abilities remain underexplored. Particularly, their multi-hop reasoning, the
ability to recall and integrate multiple facts, lacks systematic evaluation.
Existing benchmarks focus on general speech and audio-processing tasks,
conversational abilities, and fairness but overlook this aspect. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SAKURA, a benchmark assessing LALMs' multi-hop reasoning
based on speech and audio information. Results show that LALMs struggle to
integrate speech/audio representations for multi-hop reasoning, even when they
extract the relevant information correctly, highlighting a fundamental
challenge in multimodal reasoning. Our findings expose a critical limitation in
LALMs, offering insights and resources for future research.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需存储旧数据的持续学习方法AnalyticKWS，用于解决关键词识别中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时避免隐私和资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键词识别系统需要持续学习新关键词，但现有方法依赖存储旧数据，导致隐私风险和资源消耗问题。

Method: 提出AnalyticKWS方法，通过闭式解析解更新模型参数，无需梯度更新或存储旧数据，仅需单次适应新关键词。

Result: 实验表明AnalyticKWS在多种数据集和设置下优于现有持续学习方法。

Conclusion: AnalyticKWS解决了隐私和资源问题，适用于资源受限的设备。

Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) offers a vital mechanism to identify spoken commands
in voice-enabled systems, where user demands often shift, requiring models to
learn new keywords continually over time. However, a major problem is
catastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier
keywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their
usefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing
and revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective,
these methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user
data and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small
devices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic
Continual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without
revisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS
computes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only
a single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer
computational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store
old data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental
learning, the model remains lightweight and efficient. As a result, AnalyticKWS
meets the challenges mentioned earlier and suits resource-limited settings
well. Extensive experiments on various datasets and settings show that
AnalyticKWS consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图匹配最优传输（GM-OT）的方法，用于解决语言和声学模态之间的表示对齐问题，通过结合节点和边的距离度量，实现了更高效的知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言和声学模态之间存在固有差异，传统最优传输方法忽略了结构关系，导致对齐效果不佳。

Method: GM-OT将语言和声学序列建模为结构化图，最小化节点间的Wasserstein距离和边间的Gromov-Wasserstein距离，形成融合距离度量。

Result: 在普通话ASR任务中，GM-OT显著优于现有最优传输方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GM-OT通过结构化对齐提升了知识迁移效率，为模态对齐问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to
acoustic feature learning has proven effective in enhancing end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR). However, aligning representations
between linguistic and acoustic modalities remains a challenge due to inherent
modality gaps. Optimal transport (OT) has shown promise in mitigating these
gaps by minimizing the Wasserstein distance (WD) between linguistic and
acoustic feature distributions. However, previous OT-based methods overlook
structural relationships, treating feature vectors as unordered sets. To
address this, we propose Graph Matching Optimal Transport (GM-OT), which models
linguistic and acoustic sequences as structured graphs. Nodes represent feature
embeddings, while edges capture temporal and sequential relationships. GM-OT
minimizes both WD (between nodes) and Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD)
(between edges), leading to a fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance (FGWD)
formulation. This enables structured alignment and more efficient knowledge
transfer compared to existing OT-based approaches. Theoretical analysis further
shows that prior OT-based methods in linguistic knowledge transfer can be
viewed as a special case within our GM-OT framework. We evaluate GM-OT on
Mandarin ASR using a CTC-based E2E-ASR system with a PLM for knowledge
transfer. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art models, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用语音录音训练大型语言模型（LLM）可能泄露隐私，因为模型可能生成与训练数据相似的输出。

Method: USC是一种高效的编码器-解码器模型，将语音解耦为隐私保护的语义表示（内容、副语言特征）和残余声学/说话者表示（用于高保真重建）。

Result: USC的语义表示保留了内容、韵律和情感，同时去除了可识别的说话者属性，实现了最先进的语音重建。

Conclusion: USC在隐私保护表示学习中表现出色，平衡了说话者匿名化、副语言特征保留和内容保存的需求。

Abstract: The use of audio recordings of human speech to train LLMs poses privacy
concerns due to these models' potential to generate outputs that closely
resemble artifacts in the training data. In this study, we propose a speaker
privacy-preserving representation learning method through the Universal Speech
Codec (USC), a computationally efficient encoder-decoder model that
disentangles speech into: $\textit{(i)}$ privacy-preserving semantically rich
representations, capturing content and speech paralinguistics, and
$\textit{(ii)}$ residual acoustic and speaker representations that enables
high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive evaluations presented show that USC's
semantic representation preserves content, prosody, and sentiment, while
removing potentially identifiable speaker attributes. Combining both
representations, USC achieves state-of-the-art speech reconstruction.
Additionally, we introduce an evaluation methodology for measuring
privacy-preserving properties, aligning with perceptual tests. We compare USC
against other codecs in the literature and demonstrate its effectiveness on
privacy-preserving representation learning, illustrating the trade-offs of
speaker anonymization, paralinguistics retention and content preservation in
the learned semantic representations. Audio samples are shared in

Motivation: 生成式AI（GenAI）发展为自主代理后，传统深度强化学习（DRL）难以动态调整策略以捕捉用户意图语义，导致性能不佳。

Method: 1. IoKD从大型AI模型（LAM）蒸馏意图理解能力到轻量级边缘LAM（E-LAM）；2. SRL将E-LAM与DRL结合，动态优化网络服务。

Conclusion: LAMeTA有效解决了代理网络中意图感知优化的挑战，显著提升用户体验。

Abstract: Nowadays, Generative AI (GenAI) reshapes numerous domains by enabling
machines to create content across modalities. As GenAI evolves into autonomous
agents capable of reasoning, collaboration, and interaction, they are
increasingly deployed on network infrastructures to serve humans automatically.
This emerging paradigm, known as the agentic network, presents new optimization
challenges due to the demand to incorporate subjective intents of human users
expressed in natural language. Traditional generic Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) struggles to capture intent semantics and adjust policies dynamically,
thus leading to suboptimality. In this paper, we present LAMeTA, a Large AI
Model (LAM)-empowered Two-stage Approach for intent-aware agentic network
optimization. First, we propose Intent-oriented Knowledge Distillation (IoKD),
which efficiently distills intent-understanding capabilities from
resource-intensive LAMs to lightweight edge LAMs (E-LAMs) to serve end users.
Second, we develop Symbiotic Reinforcement Learning (SRL), integrating E-LAMs
with a policy-based DRL framework. In SRL, E-LAMs translate natural language
user intents into structured preference vectors that guide both state
representation and reward design. The DRL, in turn, optimizes the generative
service function chain composition and E-LAM selection based on real-time
network conditions, thus optimizing the subjective Quality-of-Experience (QoE).
Extensive experiments conducted in an agentic network with 81 agents
demonstrate that IoKD reduces mean squared error in intent prediction by up to
22.5%, while SRL outperforms conventional generic DRL by up to 23.5% in
maximizing intent-aware QoE.

solutions, highlighting performance benefits through case studies in streaming,
gaming, connected cars, and more.
  Our system leverages PCC Vivace, an online-learning based congestion control

congestion control, we also discuss lessons learned and modifications made to
adapt PCC Vivace for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The 6G mobile network is the next evolutionary step after 5G, with a
prediction of an explosive surge in mobile traffic. It provides ultra-low
latency, higher data rates, high device density, and ubiquitous coverage,
positively impacting services in various areas. Energy saving is a major
concern for new systems in the telecommunications sector because all players
are expected to reduce their carbon footprints to contribute to mitigating
climate change. Network slicing is a fundamental enabler for 6G/5G mobile
networks and various other new systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT),
Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and Industrial IoT (IIoT). However, energy-saving
methods embedded in network slicing architectures are still a research gap.
This paper discusses how to embed energy-saving methods in network-slicing
architectures that are a fundamental enabler for nearly all new innovative
systems being deployed worldwide. This paper's main contribution is a proposal
to save energy in network slicing. That is achieved by deploying ML-native
agents in NS architectures to dynamically orchestrate and optimize resources
based on user demands. The SFI2 network slicing reference architecture is the
concrete use case scenario in which contrastive learning improves energy saving
for resource allocation.

Conclusion: 该方法在避免复杂计算的同时，保持了预测准确性，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We present a novel kernel-based method for learning multivariate stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). The method follows a two-step procedure: we
first estimate the drift term function, then the (matrix-valued) diffusion
function given the drift. Occupation kernels are integral functionals on a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that aggregate information over a
trajectory. Our approach leverages vector-valued occupation kernels for
estimating the drift component of the stochastic process. For diffusion
estimation, we extend this framework by introducing operator-valued occupation
kernels, enabling the estimation of an auxiliary matrix-valued function as a
positive semi-definite operator, from which we readily derive the diffusion
estimate. This enables us to avoid common challenges in SDE learning, such as
intractable likelihoods, by optimizing a reconstruction-error-based objective.
We propose a simple learning procedure that retains strong predictive accuracy
while using Fenchel duality to promote efficiency. We validate the method on
simulated benchmarks and a real-world dataset of Amyloid imaging in healthy and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects.

Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a principled approach to Bayesian

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel iterative method for missing data imputation
that sequentially reduces the mutual information between data and their
corresponding missing mask. Inspired by GAN-based approaches, which train
generators to decrease the predictability of missingness patterns, our method
explicitly targets the reduction of mutual information. Specifically, our
algorithm iteratively minimizes the KL divergence between the joint
distribution of the imputed data and missing mask, and the product of their
marginals from the previous iteration. We show that the optimal imputation
under this framework corresponds to solving an ODE, whose velocity field
minimizes a rectified flow training objective. We further illustrate that some
existing imputation techniques can be interpreted as approximate special cases
of our mutual-information-reducing framework. Comprehensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed
approach, demonstrating superior imputation performance.

Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG)

provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning using
a penalized log-likelihood objective function. We consider both convex
(sparse-group lasso) and sparse-group non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped
absolute deviation (SCAD) penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach coupled with local
linear approximation to non-convex penalties is presented for optimization of
the objective function. For non-convex penalties, theoretical analysis
establishing local consistency in support recovery, local convexity and
precision matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided under two
sets of sufficient conditions: with and without some irrepresentability
conditions. We illustrate our approaches using both synthetic and real-data
numerical examples. In the synthetic data examples the sparse-group log-sum
penalized objective function significantly outperformed the lasso penalized as
well as SCAD penalized objective functions with $F_1$-score and Hamming
distance as performance metrics.

Abstract: Stochastic rising rested bandit (SRRB) is a setting where the arms' expected
rewards increase as they are pulled. It models scenarios in which the
performances of the different options grow as an effect of an underlying
learning process (e.g., online model selection). Even if the bandit literature
provides specifically crafted algorithms based on upper-confidence bounds for
such a setting, no study about Thompson sampling TS-like algorithms has been
performed so far. The strong regularity of the expected rewards in the SRRB
setting suggests that specific instances may be tackled effectively using
adapted and sliding-window TS approaches. This work provides novel regret
analyses for such algorithms in SRRBs, highlighting the challenges and
providing new technical tools of independent interest. Our results allow us to
identify under which assumptions TS-like algorithms succeed in achieving
sublinear regret and which properties of the environment govern the complexity
of the regret minimization problem when approached with TS. Furthermore, we
provide a regret lower bound based on a complexity index we introduce. Finally,
we conduct numerical simulations comparing TS-like algorithms with
state-of-the-art approaches for SRRBs in synthetic and real-world settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为统计因子模型提供了一种鲁棒拟合方案，适用于复杂数据环境。

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been a surge of interest in studying
low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data. Statistical factor
models $-$ i.e., low-rank plus diagonal covariance structures $-$ offer a
powerful framework for modeling such structures. However, traditional methods
for fitting statistical factor models, such as principal component analysis
(PCA) or maximum likelihood estimation assuming the data is Gaussian, are
highly sensitive to heavy tails and outliers in the observed data. In this
paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for robustly
fitting statistical factor models. Our approach is based on Tyler's M-estimator
of the scatter matrix for an elliptical distribution, and consists of solving
Tyler's maximum likelihood estimation problem while imposing a structural
constraint that enforces the low-rank plus diagonal covariance structure. We
present numerical experiments on both synthetic and real examples,
demonstrating the robustness of our method for direction-of-arrival estimation
in nonuniform noise and subspace recovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel nonparametric method for estimating
high-dimensional dynamic covariance matrices with multiple conditioning
covariates, leveraging random forests and supported by robust theoretical
guarantees. Unlike traditional static methods, our dynamic nonparametric
covariance models effectively capture distributional heterogeneity.
Furthermore, unlike kernel-smoothing methods, which are restricted to a single
conditioning covariate, our approach accommodates multiple covariates in a
fully nonparametric framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
method to use random forests for estimating high-dimensional dynamic covariance
matrices. In high-dimensional settings, we establish uniform consistency
theory, providing nonasymptotic error rates and model selection properties,
even when the response dimension grows sub-exponentially with the sample size.
These results hold uniformly across a range of conditioning variables. The
method's effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations and a stock dataset
analysis, highlighting its ability to model complex dynamics in
high-dimensional scenarios.

Conclusion: WBGP-BO方法在解决传统贝叶斯优化问题中显示出潜力，尤其在复杂场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Gaussian Process based Bayesian Optimization is a widely applied algorithm to
learn and optimize under uncertainty, well-known for its sample efficiency.
However, recently -- and more frequently -- research studies have empirically
demonstrated that the Gaussian Process fitting procedure at its core could be
its most relevant weakness. Fitting a Gaussian Process means tuning its
kernel's hyperparameters to a set of observations, but the common Maximum
Likelihood Estimation technique, usually appropriate for learning tasks, has
shown different criticalities in Bayesian Optimization, making theoretical
analysis of this algorithm an open challenge. Exploiting the analogy between
Gaussian Processes and Gaussian Distributions, we present a new approach which
uses a prefixed set of hyperparameters values to fit as many Gaussian Processes
and then combines them into a unique model as a Wasserstein Barycenter of
Gaussian Processes. We considered both "easy" test problems and others known to
undermine the \textit{vanilla} Bayesian Optimization algorithm. The new method,
namely Wasserstein Barycenter Gausssian Process based Bayesian Optimization
(WBGP-BO), resulted promising and able to converge to the optimum, contrary to
vanilla Bayesian Optimization, also on the most "tricky" test problems.

Abstract: Multi-modal contrastive learning as a self-supervised representation learning
technique has achieved great success in foundation model training, such as
CLIP~\citep{radford2021learning}. In this paper, we study the theoretical
properties of the learned representations from multi-modal contrastive learning
beyond linear representations and specific data distributions. Our analysis
reveals that, enabled by temperature optimization, multi-modal contrastive
learning not only maximizes mutual information between modalities but also
adapts to intrinsic dimensions of data, which can be much lower than
user-specified dimensions for representation vectors. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of contrastive
learning to learn low-dimensional and informative representations, bridging
theoretical insights and practical performance.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a
rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that
signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have
entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our
algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form
$\mathbf{Y} + \mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}))$ for a nonlinear
$\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and
eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized)
adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that
search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph
"deformed" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y}\mathbf{1}$. We study the
performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case
$\sigma = 0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased
signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we
rigorously characterize the critical threshold strength of rank-one signal, as
a function of the nonlinearity $\sigma$, at which an outlier eigenvalue appears
in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian. While identifying the $\sigma$ that
minimizes this critical signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we
explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching
over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem
instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical
signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$
is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms
substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while avoiding the
complexity of broader classes of algorithms like approximate message passing or
general first order methods.

Abstract: Transporting causal information learned from experiments in one population to
another is a critical challenge in clinical research and decision-making.
Causal transportability uses causal graphs to model differences between the
source and target populations and identifies conditions under which causal
effects learned from experiments can be reused in a different population.
Similarly, causal identifiability identifies conditions under which causal
effects can be estimated from observational data. However, these approaches
rely on knowing the causal graph, which is often unavailable in real-world
settings. In this work, we propose a Bayesian method for assessing whether
Z-specific (conditional) causal effects are both identifiable and
transportable, without knowing the causal graph. Our method combines
experimental data from the source population with observational data from the
target population to compute the probability that a causal effect is both
identifiable from observational data and transportable. When this holds, we
leverage both observational data from the target domain and experimental data
from the source domain to obtain an unbiased, efficient estimator of the causal
effect in the target population. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our
method correctly identifies transportable causal effects and improves causal
effect estimation.

Abstract: Distributional robustness is a central goal of prediction algorithms due to
the prevalent distribution shifts in real-world data. The prediction model aims
to minimize the worst-case risk among a class of distributions, a.k.a., an
uncertainty set. Causality provides a modeling framework with a rigorous
robustness guarantee in the above sense, where the uncertainty set is
data-driven rather than pre-specified as in traditional distributional
robustness optimization. However, current causality-inspired robustness methods
possess finite-radius robustness guarantees only in the linear settings, where
the causal relationships among the covariates and the response are linear. In
this work, we propose a nonlinear method under a causal framework by
incorporating recent developments in identifiable representation learning and
establish a distributional robustness guarantee. To our best knowledge, this is
the first causality-inspired robustness method with such a finite-radius
robustness guarantee in nonlinear settings. Empirical validation of the
theoretical findings is conducted on both synthetic data and real-world
single-cell data, also illustrating that finite-radius robustness is crucial.

Conclusion: 该方法在数学函数和实际系统（如控制臂）的随机和可靠性分析中表现出良好的可扩展性和适用性，仅需少量函数评估即可准确估计统计量和可靠性。

Abstract: Forward uncertainty quantification in dynamic systems is challenging due to
non-smooth or locally oscillating nonlinear behaviors. Spline dimensional
decomposition (SDD) effectively addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning
input coordinates via knot placement, yet its accuracy is highly sensitive to
the location of internal knots. Optimizing knots through sequential quadratic
programming can be effective, yet the optimization process becomes
computationally intense. We propose a computationally efficient,
interpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method
involves three steps: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining
subinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting optimal knot locations
at maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is
then applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and locally
oscillating responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm demonstrates
that SDD with the proposed knot selection achieves higher accuracy than SDD
with uniformly or randomly spaced knots, and also a Gaussian process surrogate
model. The proposed SDD exhibits the lowest relative variance error (2.89%),
compared to SDD with uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots
(15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%) in the first natural frequency
distribution. All surrogate models are constructed using the same 401
simulation datasets, and the relative errors are evaluated against a
2000-sample Monte Carlo simulation. The scalability and applicability of
proposed method are demonstrated through stochastic and reliability analyses of
mathematical functions (N=1, 3) and a lower control arm system (N=10). The
results confirm that both second-moment statistics and reliability estimates
can be accurately achieved with only a few hundred function evaluations or
finite element simulations.

Abstract: Time-Varying Bayesian Optimization (TVBO) is the go-to framework for
optimizing a time-varying black-box objective function that may be noisy and
expensive to evaluate. Is it possible for the instantaneous regret of a TVBO
algorithm to vanish asymptotically, and if so, when? We answer this question of
great theoretical importance by providing algorithm-independent lower regret
bounds and upper regret bounds for TVBO algorithms, from which we derive
sufficient conditions for a TVBO algorithm to have the no-regret property. Our
analysis covers all major classes of stationary kernel functions.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models constitute a widely utilized class of
ensemble learning approaches in statistics and machine learning, known for
their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have become integral
components in numerous state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures,
particularly for analyzing heterogeneous data across diverse domains. Despite
their practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection,
especially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts,
remains limited and poses significant challenges. These challenges primarily
stem from the inclusion of covariates in both the Gaussian gating functions and
expert networks, which introduces intrinsic interactions governed by partial
differential equations with respect to their parameters. In this paper, we
revisit the concept of dendrograms of mixing measures and introduce a novel
extension to Gaussian-gated Gaussian MoE models that enables consistent
estimation of the true number of mixture components and achieves the pointwise
optimal convergence rate for parameter estimation in overfitted scenarios.
Notably, this approach circumvents the need to train and compare a range of
models with varying numbers of components, thereby alleviating the
computational burden, particularly in high-dimensional or deep neural network
settings. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method in accurately recovering the number of experts. It
outperforms common criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, the
Bayesian information criterion, and the integrated completed likelihood, while
achieving optimal convergence rates for parameter estimation and accurately
approximating the regression function.

Abstract: Creating large-scale datasets for training high-performance generative models
is often prohibitively expensive, especially when associated attributes or
annotations must be provided. As a result, merging existing datasets has become
a common strategy. However, the sets of attributes across datasets are often
inconsistent, and their naive concatenation typically leads to block-wise
missing conditions. This presents a significant challenge for conditional
generative modeling when the multiple attributes are used jointly as
conditions, thereby limiting the model's controllability and applicability. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative approach, Diffusion Model
with Double Guidance, which enables precise conditional generation even when no
training samples contain all conditions simultaneously. Our method maintains
rigorous control over multiple conditions without requiring joint annotations.
We demonstrate its effectiveness in molecular and image generation tasks, where
it outperforms existing baselines both in alignment with target conditional
distributions and in controllability under missing condition settings.

the core idea behind counterfactuals remains the same in both fields--the
examination of what would have happened under different circumstances--there
are key differences in how they are used and interpreted. We introduce a formal
definition that encompasses the multi-faceted concept of the counterfactual in
CI and XAI. We then discuss how counterfactuals are used, evaluated, generated,
and operationalized in CI vs. XAI, highlighting conceptual and practical
differences. By comparing and contrasting the two, we hope to identify
opportunities for cross-fertilization across CI and XAI.

Abstract: High-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, energy, and public
policy are often made by human experts using domain knowledge and heuristics,
yet are increasingly supported by predictive and optimization-based tools. A
dominant approach in operations research is the predict-then-optimize paradigm,
where a predictive model estimates uncertain inputs, and an optimization model
recommends a decision. However, this approach often lacks interpretability and
can fail under distributional uncertainty -- particularly when the outcome
distribution is multi-modal or complex -- leading to brittle or misleading
decisions. In this paper, we introduce CREDO, a novel framework that
quantifies, for any candidate decision, a distribution-free upper bound on the
probability that the decision is suboptimal. By combining inverse optimization
geometry with conformal prediction and generative modeling, CREDO produces risk
certificates that are both statistically rigorous and practically
interpretable. This framework enables human decision-makers to audit and
validate their own decisions under uncertainty, bridging the gap between
algorithmic tools and real-world judgment.

Motivation: 传统SGD分位数算法中，分位数曲线可能交叉，缺乏单调性。本文通过平滑评分函数来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用平滑版本的SGD算法估计分位数，并分析了有无Polyak-Ruppert平均的情况。

Conclusion: 平滑SGD分位数估计方法在理论和实践中均表现良好，解决了分位数曲线交叉的问题。

Abstract: This paper considers the estimation of quantiles via a smoothed version of
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. By smoothing the score
function in the conventional SGD quantile algorithm, we achieve monotonicity in
the quantile level in that the estimated quantile curves do not cross. We
derive non-asymptotic tail probability bounds for the smoothed SGD quantile
estimate both for the case with and without Polyak-Ruppert averaging. For the
latter, we also provide a uniform Bahadur representation and a resulting
Gaussian approximation result. Numerical studies show good finite sample
behavior for our theoretical results.

Abstract: We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for
guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous
normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept
rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to
optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data
regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or
partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path
Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass
on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated
distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We
demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model,
guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states
and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges
thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a
principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning
in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency
and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and
beyond.

TL;DR: LaPON是一种结合神经网络与传统数值方法的混合框架，通过拉格朗日中值定理直接嵌入先验知识，显著提升非线性PDE求解的精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性PDE在粗分辨率下保持精度的挑战，传统物理信息机器学习方法（如PINNs）的软约束无法严格满足物理一致性。

Method: 提出LaPON，将先验知识直接嵌入神经网络架构而非损失函数，结合神经算子和传统数值方法补偿离散化误差。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes方程模拟的湍流问题中，LaPON在粗网格和大时间步长下精度和稳定性优于直接数值模拟，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: LaPON为高保真流体动力学模拟提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，展示了在天气预报和工程设计等领域的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Accelerating the solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)
while maintaining accuracy at coarse spatiotemporal resolution remains a key
challenge in scientific computing. Physics-informed machine learning (ML)
methods such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) introduce prior
knowledge through loss functions to ensure physical consistency, but their
"soft constraints" are usually not strictly satisfied. Here, we propose LaPON,
an operator network inspired by the Lagrange's mean value theorem, which embeds
prior knowledge directly into the neural network architecture instead of the
loss function, making the neural network naturally satisfy the given
constraints. This is a hybrid framework that combines neural operators with
traditional numerical methods, where neural operators are used to compensate
for the effect of discretization errors on the analytical scale in
under-resolution simulations. As evaluated on turbulence problem modeled by the
Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), the multiple time step extrapolation accuracy
and stability of LaPON exceed the direct numerical simulation baseline at 8x
coarser grids and 8x larger time steps, while achieving a vorticity correlation
of more than 0.98 with the ground truth. It is worth noting that the model can
be well generalized to unseen flow states, such as turbulence with different
forcing, without retraining. In addition, with the same training data, LaPON's
comprehensive metrics on the out-of-distribution test set are at least
approximately twice as good as two popular ML baseline methods. By combining
numerical computing with machine learning, LaPON provides a scalable and
reliable solution for high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulation, showing the
potential for wide application in fields such as weather forecasting and
engineering design.

Abstract: The development of novel pharmaceuticals represents a significant challenge
in modern science, with substantial costs and time investments. Deep generative

we examine their capabilities in generating valid, unique, and novel molecular
structures while maintaining specific chemical properties. Our findings reveal
that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across various
metrics, highlighting the complex trade-offs between exploration and
exploitation in chemical space. This study provides detailed insights into the

Abstract: Neural networks are powerful tools for data-driven modeling of complex
dynamical systems, enhancing predictive capability for control applications.
However, their inherent nonlinearity and black-box nature challenge control
designs that prioritize rigorous safety and recursive feasibility guarantees.
This paper presents algorithmic methods for synthesizing control invariant sets
specifically tailored to neural network based dynamical models. These
algorithms employ set recursion, ensuring termination after a finite number of
iterations and generating subsets in which closed-loop dynamics are forward
invariant, thus guaranteeing perpetual operational safety. Additionally, we
propose model predictive control designs that integrate these control invariant
sets into mixed-integer optimization, with guaranteed adherence to safety
constraints and recursive feasibility at the computational level. We also
present a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the properties and
guarantees of the proposed methods. Numerical simulations in an autonomous
driving scenario demonstrate the methods' effectiveness in synthesizing
control-invariant sets offline and implementing model predictive control
online, ensuring safety and recursive feasibility.

Conclusion: 提出的GNN-RL方法在D2D通信中实现了延迟优化和用户公平性的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The pursuit of rate maximization in wireless communication frequently
encounters substantial challenges associated with user fairness. This paper
addresses these challenges by exploring a novel power allocation approach for
delay optimization, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs)-based reinforcement
learning (RL) in device-to-device (D2D) communication. The proposed approach
incorporates not only channel state information but also factors such as packet
delay, the number of backlogged packets, and the number of transmitted packets
into the components of the state information. We adopt a centralized RL method,
where a central controller collects and processes the state information. The
central controller functions as an agent trained using the proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm. To better utilize topology information in the
communication network and enhance the generalization of the proposed method, we
embed GNN layers into both the actor and critic networks of the PPO algorithm.
This integration allows for efficient parameter updates of GNNs and enables the
state information to be parameterized as a low-dimensional embedding, which is
leveraged by the agent to optimize power allocation strategies. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces average delay
while ensuring user fairness, outperforms baseline methods, and exhibits
scalability and generalization capability.

Conclusion: 该框架为商业AI招聘平台的公平性审计提供了可扩展的工具，尤其在黑盒设置中，强调了反事实方法在提升情感计算伦理透明度中的重要性。

Abstract: AI-enhanced personality assessments are increasingly shaping hiring
decisions, using affective computing to predict traits from the Big Five
(OCEAN) model. However, integrating AI into these assessments raises ethical
concerns, especially around bias amplification rooted in training data. These
biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes based on protected attributes like
gender, ethnicity, and age. To address this, we introduce a
counterfactual-based framework to systematically evaluate and quantify bias in
AI-driven personality assessments. Our approach employs generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to generate counterfactual representations of job applicants by
altering protected attributes, enabling fairness analysis without access to the
underlying model. Unlike traditional bias assessments that focus on unimodal or
static data, our method supports multimodal evaluation-spanning visual, audio,
and textual features. This comprehensive approach is particularly important in
high-stakes applications like hiring, where third-party vendors often provide
AI systems as black boxes. Applied to a state-of-the-art personality prediction
model, our method reveals significant disparities across demographic groups. We
also validate our framework using a protected attribute classifier to confirm
the effectiveness of our counterfactual generation. This work provides a
scalable tool for fairness auditing of commercial AI hiring platforms,
especially in black-box settings where training data and model internals are
inaccessible. Our results highlight the importance of counterfactual approaches
in improving ethical transparency in affective computing.

Motivation: 解决大规模本科STEM课程中个性化反馈的挑战。

Method: 系统使用GPT-4生成个性化反馈，要求学生解释答案并评估信心，同时提供教材引用。

Result: 反馈类型对成绩无显著影响，但信心评分和解释要求对学生考试策略有积极影响。40%学生使用了教材引用。

Conclusion: 结构化反思要求比复杂反馈机制更具影响力。

Abstract: Providing personalized, detailed feedback at scale in large undergraduate
STEM courses remains a persistent challenge. We present an empirically
evaluated practice exam system that integrates AI generated feedback with
targeted textbook references, deployed in a large introductory biology course.
Our system encourages metacognitive behavior by asking students to explain
their answers and declare their confidence. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate
personalized feedback based on this information, while directing them to
relevant textbook sections. Through interaction logs from consenting
participants across three midterms (541, 342, and 413 students respectively),
totaling 28,313 question-student interactions across 146 learning objectives,
along with 279 surveys and 23 interviews, we examined the system's impact on
learning outcomes and engagement. Across all midterms, feedback types showed no
statistically significant performance differences, though some trends suggested
potential benefits. The most substantial impact came from the required
confidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to
their actual exam strategies. About 40 percent of students engaged with
textbook references when prompted by feedback -- far higher than traditional
reading rates. Survey data revealed high satisfaction (mean rating 4.1 of 5),
with 82.1 percent reporting increased confidence on practiced midterm topics,
and 73.4 percent indicating they could recall and apply specific concepts. Our
findings suggest that embedding structured reflection requirements may be more
impactful than sophisticated feedback mechanisms.

Motivation: 预测机器人-物体交互的未来视觉状态是挑战，现有方法难以实现高质量像素级表示。

Method: 提出LaDi-WM，基于扩散模型预测潜在空间状态，结合DINO和CLIP特征，并设计扩散策略迭代优化动作。

Result: 在LIBERO-LONG和真实场景中，策略性能分别提升27.9%和20%，且具备强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LaDi-WM通过潜在空间预测和扩散策略，显著提升机器人策略的准确性和泛化性。

Abstract: Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the
Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance
by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual
states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known
challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations.
To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space
of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the
well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models
(VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic
features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent
space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting
pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that
iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby
generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly
enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on
the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve
impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.

Result: OCR方法在泛化任务中表现优于其他方法，无需任务特定预训练。

Conclusion: OCR是设计适应动态真实世界环境的视觉系统的有前途方向。

Abstract: Visual representations are central to the learning and generalization
capabilities of robotic manipulation policies. While existing methods rely on
global or dense features, such representations often entangle task-relevant and
irrelevant scene information, limiting robustness under distribution shifts. In
this work, we investigate object-centric representations (OCR) as a structured
alternative that segments visual input into a finished set of entities,
introducing inductive biases that align more naturally with manipulation tasks.
We benchmark a range of visual encoders-object-centric, global and dense
methods-across a suite of simulated and real-world manipulation tasks ranging
from simple to complex, and evaluate their generalization under diverse visual
conditions including changes in lighting, texture, and the presence of
distractors. Our findings reveal that OCR-based policies outperform dense and
global representations in generalization settings, even without task-specific
pretraining. These insights suggest that OCR is a promising direction for
designing visual systems that generalize effectively in dynamic, real-world
robotic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为真实世界部署中的复杂性和动态性提供了更鲁棒的操控策略，标志着重要进展。

Abstract: Training vision-based manipulation policies that are robust across diverse
visual environments remains an important and unresolved challenge in robot
learning. Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant
representations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing
generalization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually
diverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when
combined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in
enabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual
distribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to
simpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled
representation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically
complex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual
perturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this
approach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically
show significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art
imitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted
from the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural
network policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not
only visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We
believe that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies
that are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities
and dynamical nature of real-world deployment. Supplementary videos are

Motivation: 现有方法在生成CBFs时存在非可微或不准确的近似问题，无法确保安全性。

Method: 使用PINNs计算Hamilton-Jacobi最优控制解，生成平滑的CBFs（称为RBNs），并通过参数化折扣项调整保守性。

Result: RBNs在低维中高度准确，在高维中比标准神经CBF方法更安全，例如在9D多车避碰问题中安全性提高5.5倍，保守性降低1.9倍。

Conclusion: RBNs为非线性自治系统合成CBFs提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in autonomous driving and robotics underscore the
necessity of safety-critical controllers. Control barrier functions (CBFs) are
a popular method for appending safety guarantees to a general control
framework, but they are notoriously difficult to generate beyond low
dimensions. Existing methods often yield non-differentiable or inaccurate
approximations that lack integrity, and thus fail to ensure safety. In this
work, we use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to generate smooth
approximations of CBFs by computing Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) optimal control
solutions. These reachability barrier networks (RBNs) avoid traditional
dimensionality constraints and support the tuning of their conservativeness
post-training through a parameterized discount term. To ensure robustness of
the discounted solutions, we leverage conformal prediction methods to derive
probabilistic safety guarantees for RBNs. We demonstrate that RBNs are highly
accurate in low dimensions, and safer than the standard neural CBF approach in
high dimensions. Namely, we showcase the RBNs in a 9D multi-vehicle collision
avoidance problem where it empirically proves to be 5.5x safer and 1.9x less
conservative than the neural CBFs, offering a promising method to synthesize
CBFs for general nonlinear autonomous systems.

Conclusion: LKAlert提升了ADAS的安全性和可用性，为黑盒自动化提供了可扩展的监督范式。

Abstract: Lane Keeping Assist systems, while increasingly prevalent, often suffer from
unpredictable real-world failures, largely due to their opaque, black-box
nature, which limits driver anticipation and trust. To bridge the gap between
automated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel
supervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3
seconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating
surrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as
automated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert
issues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,
enhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development
and evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark
dataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It
contains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications
across annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable
methodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining
surrogate feature guidance with LoRA. This framework enables VLM to reason over
structured visual context without altering its vision backbone, making it
broadly applicable to other complex, opaque systems requiring interpretable
oversight. Empirical results correctly predicts upcoming LKA failures with
69.8% accuracy and a 58.6\% F1-score. The system also generates high-quality
textual explanations for drivers (71.7 ROUGE-L) and operates efficiently at
approximately 2 Hz, confirming its suitability for real-time, in-vehicle use.
Our findings establish LKAlert as a practical solution for enhancing the safety
and usability of current ADAS and offer a scalable paradigm for applying VLMs
to human-centered supervision of black-box automation.

Abstract: Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos offers a
promising path toward generalizable and interpretable robotic
intelligence-particularly through the lens of actionable affordances. However,
transferring such knowledge remains challenging due to: 1) a lack of
large-scale datasets with precise affordance annotations, and 2) insufficient
exploration of affordances in diverse manipulation contexts. To address these
gaps, we introduce HOVA-500K, a large-scale, affordance-annotated dataset
comprising 500,000 images across 1,726 object categories and 675 actions. We
also release a standardized benchmarking suite for multi-modal affordance
reasoning. Built upon HOVA-500K, we present GLOVER++, a global-to-local
affordance training framework that effectively transfers actionable affordance
knowledge from human demonstrations to downstream open-vocabulary reasoning
tasks. GLOVER++ achieves state-of-the-art results on the HOVA-500K benchmark
and demonstrates strong generalization across diverse downstream robotic
manipulation tasks. By explicitly modeling actionable affordances, GLOVER++
facilitates robust transfer across scenes, modalities, and tasks. We hope that
HOVA-500K and the GLOVER++ framework will serve as valuable resources for
bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic manipulation
capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a pioneering experimental study on the automated
packing of a catering package using a two-fingered gripper affixed to a
3-degree-of-freedom Delta parallel robot. A distinctive contribution lies in
the application of a deep learning approach to tackle this challenge. A custom
dataset, comprising 1,500 images, is meticulously curated for this endeavor,
representing a noteworthy initiative as the first dataset focusing on
Persian-manufactured products. The study employs the YOLOV5 model for object
detection, followed by segmentation using the FastSAM model. Subsequently,
rotation angle calculation is facilitated with segmentation masks, and a
rotated rectangle encapsulating the object is generated. This rectangle forms
the basis for calculating two grasp points using a novel geometrical approach
involving eigenvectors. An extensive experimental study validates the proposed
model, where all pertinent information is seamlessly transmitted to the 3-DOF
Delta parallel robot. The proposed algorithm ensures real-time detection,
calibration, and the fully autonomous packing process of a catering package,
boasting an impressive over 80\% success rate in automatic grasping. This study
marks a significant stride in advancing the capabilities of robotic systems for
practical applications in packaging automation.

TL;DR: 提出了基于视觉感知的灵巧全身控制框架PDC，仅依赖自我中心视觉完成任务，无需特权状态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类视觉感知驱动行为的启发，旨在通过视觉线索实现复杂任务，如物体搜索、放置和技能选择。

Method: PDC框架利用强化学习从零开始训练单一策略，仅依赖视觉输入完成任务。

Result: 成功实现了多种家庭任务，如抓取、放置和操作铰接物体，并涌现出主动搜索等行为。

Conclusion: 视觉驱动控制能诱导类人行为，为动画、机器人和具身AI的感知-动作闭环提供关键支持。

Abstract: Human behavior is fundamentally shaped by visual perception -- our ability to
interact with the world depends on actively gathering relevant information and
adapting our movements accordingly. Behaviors like searching for objects,
reaching, and hand-eye coordination naturally emerge from the structure of our
sensory system. Inspired by these principles, we introduce Perceptive Dexterous
Control (PDC), a framework for vision-driven dexterous whole-body control with
simulated humanoids. PDC operates solely on egocentric vision for task
specification, enabling object search, target placement, and skill selection
through visual cues, without relying on privileged state information (e.g., 3D
object positions and geometries). This perception-as-interface paradigm enables
learning a single policy to perform multiple household tasks, including
reaching, grasping, placing, and articulated object manipulation. We also show
that training from scratch with reinforcement learning can produce emergent
behaviors such as active search. These results demonstrate how vision-driven
control and complex tasks induce human-like behaviors and can serve as the key
ingredients in closing the perception-action loop for animation, robotics, and
embodied AI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无结构的视觉惯性里程计（VIO），通过移除视觉地图，提高了计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉惯性里程计（VIO）依赖视觉地图和定位的紧密耦合，但无地图的高效定位方案尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种无结构的VIO框架，移除了视觉地图模块。

Result: 实验表明，无结构VIO在计算效率和精度上均优于传统结构化的VIO。

Conclusion: 无结构VIO是一种高效且精确的替代方案，适用于不需要视觉地图的场景。

Abstract: Visual odometry (VO) is typically considered as a chicken-and-egg problem, as
the localization and mapping modules are tightly-coupled. The estimation of
visual map relies on accurate localization information. Meanwhile, localization
requires precise map points to provide motion constraints. This classical
design principle is naturally inherited by visual-inertial odometry (VIO).
Efficient localization solution that does not require a map has not been fully
investigated. To this end, we propose a novel structureless VIO, where the
visual map is removed from the odometry framework. Experimental results
demonstrated that, compared to the structure-based VIO baseline, our
structureless VIO not only substantially improves computational efficiency but
also has advantages in accuracy.

TL;DR: RoboFAC框架通过构建包含错误轨迹和QA对的数据集，提升VLA模型在开放场景中的失败恢复能力，实验显示其性能优于GPT-4o，并显著改善真实任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在开放场景中表现不佳，因其主要基于成功演示训练，缺乏失败恢复能力。

Method: 构建RoboFAC数据集（9,440错误轨迹和78,623 QA对），开发具备任务理解、失败分析和纠正能力的RoboFAC模型。

Result: RoboFAC模型在评估基准上优于GPT-4o 34.1%，在真实任务中平均提升29.1%。

Conclusion: RoboFAC框架有效处理机器人失败并辅助VLA模型恢复，提升开放场景适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic
manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information
into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in
open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert
demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this
work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework
to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440
erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks
and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our
dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding,
Failure Analysis and Failure Correction. Experimental results demonstrate that
the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark.
Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control
pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding
a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results
show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and
assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Result: 模拟与真实世界性能高度相关，验证了TeleOpBench的外部有效性。

Conclusion: TeleOpBench为远程操作研究提供了统一标准，并为未来算法和硬件创新提供了可扩展平台。

Abstract: Teleoperation is a cornerstone of embodied-robot learning, and bimanual
dexterous teleoperation in particular provides rich demonstrations that are
difficult to obtain with fully autonomous systems. While recent studies have
proposed diverse hardware pipelines-ranging from inertial motion-capture gloves
to exoskeletons and vision-based interfaces-there is still no unified benchmark
that enables fair, reproducible comparison of these systems. In this paper, we
introduce TeleOpBench, a simulator-centric benchmark tailored to bimanual
dexterous teleoperation. TeleOpBench contains 30 high-fidelity task
environments that span pick-and-place, tool use, and collaborative
manipulation, covering a broad spectrum of kinematic and force-interaction
difficulty. Within this benchmark we implement four representative
teleoperation modalities-(i) MoCap, (ii) VR device, (iii) arm-hand
exoskeletons, and (iv) monocular vision tracking-and evaluate them with a
common protocol and metric suite. To validate that performance in simulation is
predictive of real-world behavior, we conduct mirrored experiments on a
physical dual-arm platform equipped with two 6-DoF dexterous hands. Across 10
held-out tasks we observe a strong correlation between simulator and hardware
performance, confirming the external validity of TeleOpBench. TeleOpBench
establishes a common yardstick for teleoperation research and provides an
extensible platform for future algorithmic and hardware innovation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的自动驾驶规划方法，结合正常和对抗性行为预测，实现鲁棒性规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法可能过度加权对抗性行为或使用不适用于所有场景的安全约束，导致规划过于保守或不灵活。

Method: 训练扩散模型学习正常行为分布，测试时生成对抗性预测，通过混合分布评分候选计划。

Result: 在单/多智能体乱穿马路和闯红灯场景中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在对抗性行为下保持鲁棒性，同时在正常行为下不过度保守。

Abstract: We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal
and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for
motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased
distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of
adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate
predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans
using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and
adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against
adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally.
Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight
adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal
behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all
driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and
multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.

Abstract: Recent advancements in adaptive control for reference trajectory tracking
enable quadrupedal robots to perform locomotion tasks under challenging

disturbances in terms of forces and torques. However, a specific case of
disturbances that are periodic was not explicitly tackled in application to
quadrupeds. This work is devoted to the estimation of the periodic disturbances
with a lightweight regressor using simplified robot dynamics and extracting the
disturbance properties in terms of the magnitude and frequency. Experimental
evidence suggests performance improvement over the baseline static disturbance
compensation. All source files, including simulation setups, code, and
calculation scripts, are available on GitHub at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynamicDTA是一种深度学习框架，结合静态和动态蛋白质特征，显著提升药物-靶标结合亲和力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型多依赖静态蛋白质结构，忽略了蛋白质的动态特性，而动态特性对结合亲和力预测至关重要。

Method: DynamicDTA整合药物序列、蛋白质序列和动态描述符，通过图卷积网络、扩张卷积和多层感知器处理，并使用交叉注意力和张量融合网络整合特征。

Result: 在三个数据集上，DynamicDTA的RMSE得分比七种基线方法至少提升3.4%，并在HIV-1新药预测中验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: DynamicDTA通过融合动态蛋白质特征，显著提升了药物-靶标结合亲和力预测的准确性和生物相关性。

Abstract: Predicting drug-target binding affinity (DTA) is essential for identifying
potential therapeutic candidates in drug discovery. However, most existing
models rely heavily on static protein structures, often overlooking the dynamic
nature of proteins, which is crucial for capturing conformational flexibility
that will be beneficial for protein binding interactions. We introduce
DynamicDTA, an innovative deep learning framework that incorporates static and
dynamic protein features to enhance DTA prediction. The proposed DynamicDTA
takes three types of inputs, including drug sequence, protein sequence, and
dynamic descriptors. A molecular graph representation of the drug sequence is
generated and subsequently processed through graph convolutional network, while
the protein sequence is encoded using dilated convolutions. Dynamic
descriptors, such as root mean square fluctuation, are processed through a
multi-layer perceptron. These embedding features are fused with static protein
features using cross-attention, and a tensor fusion network integrates all
three modalities for DTA prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that DynamicDTA achieves by at least 3.4% improvement in RMSE score
with comparison to seven state-of-the-art baseline methods. Additionally,
predicting novel drugs for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and visualizing
the docking complexes further demonstrates the reliability and biological
relevance of DynamicDTA.

Motivation: 研究动机在于填补对LKA系统在真实环境中性能的实证研究空白，并识别其故障模式和影响因素，以推动更安全的自动驾驶技术发展。

Method: 通过分析LKA相关的CAN信号，系统分类故障模式（感知、规划、控制），并统计环境与道路条件对故障的影响。结合道路几何、速度限制和LKA转向能力，提出理论模型和机器学习工具。

Result: 研究发现LKA故障可分为三类，且系统倾向于固定车道居中策略导致外漂移。环境因素中，模糊车道标记、低对比度和急弯是主要故障诱因。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前LKA系统的局限性，提出了改进道路设计的理论模型和评估工具，为自动驾驶技术的安全部署提供了支持。

Abstract: Leveraging a newly released open dataset of Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) systems
from production vehicles, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical
analysis of real-world LKA performance. Our study yields three key findings:
(i) LKA failures can be systematically categorized into perception, planning,
and control errors. We present representative examples of each failure mode
through in-depth analysis of LKA-related CAN signals, enabling both
justification of the failure mechanisms and diagnosis of when and where each
module begins to degrade; (ii) LKA systems tend to follow a fixed
lane-centering strategy, often resulting in outward drift that increases
linearly with road curvature, whereas human drivers proactively steer slightly
inward on similar curved segments; (iii) We provide the first statistical
summary and distribution analysis of environmental and road conditions under
LKA failures, identifying with statistical significance that faded lane
markings, low pavement laneline contrast, and sharp curvature are the most
dominant individual factors, along with critical combinations that
substantially increase failure likelihood. Building on these insights, we
propose a theoretical model that integrates road geometry, speed limits, and
LKA steering capability to inform infrastructure design. Additionally, we
develop a machine learning-based model to assess roadway readiness for LKA
deployment, offering practical tools for safer infrastructure planning,
especially in rural areas. This work highlights key limitations of current LKA
systems and supports the advancement of safer and more reliable autonomous
driving technologies.

Result: 发现事件前风险缓解策略、人机物理交互研究及基础模型本身问题是未来研究重点。

Conclusion: 该综述为FMRs的物理风险控制提供了高分辨率分析，有助于实现良好的人机关系。

Abstract: Recent Foundation Model-enabled robotics (FMRs) display greatly improved
general-purpose skills, enabling more adaptable automation than conventional
robotics. Their ability to handle diverse tasks thus creates new opportunities
to replace human labor. However, unlike general foundation models, FMRs
interact with the physical world, where their actions directly affect the
safety of humans and surrounding objects, requiring careful deployment and
control. Based on this proposition, our survey comprehensively summarizes robot
control approaches to mitigate physical risks by covering all the lifespan of
FMRs ranging from pre-deployment to post-accident stage. Specifically, we
broadly divide the timeline into the following three phases: (1) pre-deployment
phase, (2) pre-incident phase, and (3) post-incident phase. Throughout this
survey, we find that there is much room to study (i) pre-incident risk
mitigation strategies, (ii) research that assumes physical interaction with
humans, and (iii) essential issues of foundation models themselves. We hope
that this survey will be a milestone in providing a high-resolution analysis of
the physical risks of FMRs and their control, contributing to the realization
of a good human-robot relationship.

Abstract: We introduce DreamGen, a simple yet highly effective 4-stage pipeline for
training robot policies that generalize across behaviors and environments
through neural trajectories - synthetic robot data generated from video world
models. DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models,
adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic
synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since
these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using
either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its
simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a
humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen
environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single
pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline
systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that
shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy
success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning
well beyond manual data collection.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了初始抓取问题，并在真实系统中实现了自主操作。

Abstract: In-hand manipulation and grasping are fundamental yet often separately
addressed tasks in robotics. For deriving in-hand manipulation policies,
reinforcement learning has recently shown great success. However, the derived
controllers are not yet useful in real-world scenarios because they often
require a human operator to place the objects in suitable initial (grasping)
states. Finding stable grasps that also promote the desired in-hand
manipulation goal is an open problem. In this work, we propose a method for
bridging this gap by leveraging the critic network of a reinforcement learning
agent trained for in-hand manipulation to score and select initial grasps. Our
experiments show that this method significantly increases the success rate of
in-hand manipulation without requiring additional training. We also present an
implementation of a full grasp manipulation pipeline on a real-world system,
enabling autonomous grasping and reorientation even of unwieldy objects.

Result: SR生成的公式复杂度与传统方法相当，但精度更高，且能无缝扩展以包含负载依赖等动态因素。

Conclusion: 符号回归是一种有效的方法，兼具模型驱动和数据驱动的优势，适用于机器人硬件和安全关键应用。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the friction torque in robotic joints has long been
challenging due to the request for a robust mathematical description.
Traditional model-based approaches are often labor-intensive, requiring
extensive experiments and expert knowledge, and they are difficult to adapt to
new scenarios and dependencies. On the other hand, data-driven methods based on
neural networks are easier to implement but often lack robustness,
interpretability, and trustworthiness--key considerations for robotic hardware
and safety-critical applications such as human-robot interaction. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose the use of symbolic regression
(SR) to estimate the friction torque. SR generates interpretable symbolic
formulas similar to those produced by model-based methods while being flexible
to accommodate various dynamic effects and dependencies. In this work, we apply
SR algorithms to approximate the friction torque using collected data from a
KUKA LWR-IV+ robot. Our results show that SR not only yields formulas with
comparable complexity to model-based approaches but also achieves higher
accuracy. Moreover, SR-derived formulas can be seamlessly extended to include
load dependencies and other dynamic factors.

Abstract: One of the most important object properties that humans and robots perceive
through touch is hardness. This paper investigates information-theoretic active
sampling strategies for sample-efficient hardness classification with
vision-based tactile sensors. We evaluate three probabilistic classifier models
and two model-uncertainty-based sampling strategies on a robotic setup as well
as on a previously published dataset of samples collected by human testers. Our
findings indicate that the active sampling approaches, driven by uncertainty
metrics, surpass a random sampling baseline in terms of accuracy and stability.
Additionally, while in our human study, the participants achieve an average
accuracy of 48.00%, our best approach achieves an average accuracy of 88.78% on
the same set of objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based
tactile sensors for object hardness classification.

Abstract: Robotic bin packing aids in a wide range of real-world scenarios such as
e-commerce and warehouses. Yet, existing works focus mainly on considering the
shape of objects to optimize packing compactness and neglect object properties
such as fragility, edibility, and chemistry that humans typically consider when
packing objects. This paper presents OPA-Pack (Object-Property-Aware Packing
framework), the first framework that equips the robot with object property
considerations in planning the object packing. Technical-wise, we develop a
novel object property recognition scheme with retrieval-augmented generation
and chain-of-thought reasoning, and build a dataset with object property
annotations for 1,032 everyday objects. Also, we formulate OPA-Net, aiming to
jointly separate incompatible object pairs and reduce pressure on fragile
objects, while compacting the packing. Further, OPA-Net consists of a property
embedding layer to encode the property of candidate objects to be packed,
together with a fragility heightmap and an avoidance heightmap to keep track of
the packed objects. Then, we design a reward function and adopt a deep
Q-learning scheme to train OPA-Net. Experimental results manifest that OPA-Pack
greatly improves the accuracy of separating incompatible object pairs (from 52%
to 95%) and largely reduces pressure on fragile objects (by 29.4%), while
maintaining good packing compactness. Besides, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of OPA-Pack on a real packing platform, showcasing its practicality in
real-world scenarios.

*Ivan Bioli,Carlo Marcati,Giancarlo Sangalli*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机Nyström预处理的矩阵自由自然梯度下降（NGD）方法，用于加速训练神经网络求解偏微分方程（PDEs），克服了传统方法中Gramian矩阵条件数差导致的计算效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然梯度下降（NGD）在训练神经网络求解PDEs时具有潜力，但高计算成本和Gramian矩阵的病态性限制了其实际应用。

Method: 扩展了矩阵自由NGD方法，引入随机Nyström预处理技术，加速共轭梯度（CG）求解器的收敛。

Result: 新算法在多种PDE问题上显著优于现有NGD方法。

Conclusion: 随机Nyström预处理有效提升了矩阵自由NGD的计算效率，为神经网络求解PDEs提供了更实用的优化工具。

Abstract: Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization
algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential
equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However,
its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving
linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods
based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion,
the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG.
In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than
previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nystr\"om
preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting
algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing
NGD-based methods on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks.

### [838] [BOLT: Block-Orthonormal Lanczos for Trace estimation of matrix functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12289)
*Kingsley Yeon,Promit Ghosal,Mihai Anitescu*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: BOLT方法通过正交块探针和Lanczos迭代，在受限矩阵访问条件下高效估计矩阵迹，优于Hutch++。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模矩阵应用中，矩阵无法完全存储或访问，现有方法（如Hutch++）依赖完整矩阵-向量乘积，难以适用。

Method: 提出BOLT方法，基于正交块探针和Lanczos迭代，并扩展为Subblock SLQ以处理子矩阵访问限制。

Result: BOLT在精度上与Hutch++相当，且在平坦谱区域表现更优，适用于低内存和部分访问场景。

Conclusion: BOLT和Subblock SLQ为受限矩阵访问提供了高效迹估计框架，适用于高维场景。

Abstract: Efficient matrix trace estimation is essential for scalable computation of
log-determinants, matrix norms, and distributional divergences. In many
large-scale applications, the matrices involved are too large to store or
access in full, making even a single matrix-vector (mat-vec) product
infeasible. Instead, one often has access only to small subblocks of the matrix
or localized matrix-vector products on restricted index sets. Hutch++ achieves
optimal convergence rate but relies on randomized SVD and assumes full mat-vec
access, making it difficult to apply in these constrained settings. We propose
the Block-Orthonormal Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature (BOLT), which matches
Hutch++ accuracy with a simpler implementation based on orthonormal block
probes and Lanczos iterations. BOLT builds on the Stochastic Lanczos Quadrature
(SLQ) framework, which combines random probing with Krylov subspace methods to
efficiently approximate traces of matrix functions, and performs better than
Hutch++ in near flat-spectrum regimes. To address memory limitations and
partial access constraints, we introduce Subblock SLQ, a variant of BOLT that
operates only on small principal submatrices. As a result, this framework
yields a proxy KL divergence estimator and an efficient method for computing
the Wasserstein-2 distance between Gaussians - both compatible with low-memory
and partial-access regimes. We provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate
strong empirical performance across a range of high-dimensional settings.

Motivation: Tucker分解（TD）在数据科学中广泛应用，但其通常不可识别。本文旨在研究非负TD（nTD）的可识别性，以恢复数据生成的真实源。

Method: 通过扩展NMF的可识别性结果，要求非负矩阵因子满足稀疏性条件（如可分离性或充分分散条件），核心张量只需部分切片或展开具有满列秩。

Result: 在稀疏性条件下，提出了通过最小化核心张量展开或切片的体积来获得可识别nTD的几种方法。

Conclusion: 证明了在稀疏性条件下，nTD具有可识别性，为数据分析和信号处理提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Tensor decompositions have become a central tool in data science, with
applications in areas such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine
learning. A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical
polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to
trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the
groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a
central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general
not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the
nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of
nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD.
Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of
sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently
scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or
linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not
need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures,
using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable
nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.

TL;DR: FG-CLEP通过恢复心电图中缺失的波形特征，结合大语言模型和对比学习，提升了心电图诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心电图-文本对比学习方法忽略了报告中波形特征的缺失，限制了模型对波形特征和诊断推理的理解。

Method: 提出FG-CLEP，利用大语言模型恢复波形特征，引入语义相似矩阵和sigmoid损失函数。

Result: 在六个数据集上，FG-CLEP在零样本预测和线性探测中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FG-CLEP通过恢复波形特征和改进对比学习，显著提升了心电图诊断性能。

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown
promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given
an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and
then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their
importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as
intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the
model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its
understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this,
we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which
aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help
of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the
non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses.
Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of
common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide
contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to
accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six
datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代VLSI后端设计中，高阶非线性系统的仿真计算资源需求高，传统方法面临分岔不稳定性和混沌行为的挑战。

Method: 采用嵌套变压器框架，将高阶传递函数分解为一阶模态项，避免传统Jacobian矩阵迭代，计算复杂度从立方降至线性。

Result: 在1至10阶网络中，测试集准确率达0.99（R²），仿真速度提升18倍。

Conclusion: S-Crescendo为高维非线性建模提供了可扩展的物理感知框架。

Abstract: Simulation of high-order nonlinear system requires extensive computational
resources, especially in modern VLSI backend design where bifurcation-induced
instability and chaos-like transient behaviors pose challenges. We present
S-Crescendo - a nested transformer weaving framework that synergizes S-domain
with neural operators for scalable time-domain prediction in high-order
nonlinear networks, alleviating the computational bottlenecks of conventional
solvers via Newton-Raphson method. By leveraging the partial-fraction
decomposition of an n-th order transfer function into first-order modal terms
with repeated poles and residues, our method bypasses the conventional Jacobian
matrix-based iterations and efficiently reduces computational complexity from
cubic $O(n^3)$ to linear $O(n)$.The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates
an S-domain encoder with an attention-based correction operator to
simultaneously isolate dominant response and adaptively capture higher-order
non-linearities. Validated on order-1 to order-10 networks, our method achieves
up to 0.99 test-set ($R^2$) accuracy against HSPICE golden waveforms and
accelerates simulation by up to 18(X), providing a scalable, physics-aware
framework for high-dimensional nonlinear modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合物理知识的生成式多视角（Gen-MV）感知框架，通过多基站与用户设备间的信道状态信息（CSI）实现高精度目标感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多视角CSI数据中的物理相关性，解决目标感知问题，并适应不同基站-用户设备对的配置。

Method: 设计了一个双部分神经网络架构：第一部分通过编码器融合多视角CSI中的目标特征；第二部分使用条件扩散模型生成目标的点云。编码器引入空间位置嵌入方案以捕捉电磁波传播特性。

Result: 实验表明，Gen-MV框架在目标形状和电磁特性重建质量上表现出优异的灵活性和显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架为多视角目标感知提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based
high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information
(CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind
of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional
generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network
architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to
fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the
second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide
the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture
the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive
to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature
of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme,
which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels.
Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to
generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing
framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance
improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.

Method: 比较了五种交叉验证设置，应用于三个跨主题分类任务和四种复杂架构，训练了超过10万个模型。

Conclusion: 本文为EEG深度学习研究者提供了数据分区和交叉验证的分析，并提出了避免数据泄漏的指南。

Abstract: Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of
electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear
patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial
for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can
produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties
(e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and,
increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the
field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning
and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative
evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and
generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental
strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning
and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five
cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject
classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and
four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet,
EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000
trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based
cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except
when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights
the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested
counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models
overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep
learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation
and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain
with potentially overestimated performance claims.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无线电信号表示学习中缺乏对物理特性的关注，且需要大量标注数据。SpaRTran旨在通过稀疏自编码器学习更灵活、更通用的表示。

Conclusion: SpaRTran是一种高效、灵活的基模型，适用于多种无线电下游任务，显著减少标注需求并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an
unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of
compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that
focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal
basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse
gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned
representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal
reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which
increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal
patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 %
compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a
challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining
effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual
radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be
fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the
cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than
existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.

Result: 在五个公开医学图像分割数据集上，MedVKAN在四个数据集上表现最佳，另一个排名第二。

Conclusion: MedVKAN展示了Mamba和KAN在医学图像分割中的潜力，提供了一种高效的特征提取框架。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation relies heavily on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and Transformer-based models. However, CNNs are constrained by limited
receptive fields, while Transformers suffer from scalability challenges due to
their quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, recent
advances have explored alternative architectures. The state-space model Mamba
offers near-linear complexity while capturing long-range dependencies, and the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhances nonlinear expressiveness by replacing
fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Building on these strengths, we
propose MedVKAN, an efficient feature extraction model integrating Mamba and
KAN. Specifically, we introduce the EFC-KAN module, which enhances KAN with
convolutional operations to improve local pixel interaction. We further design
the VKAN module, integrating Mamba with EFC-KAN as a replacement for
Transformer modules, significantly improving feature extraction. Extensive
experiments on five public medical image segmentation datasets show that
MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second
on the remaining one. These results validate the potential of Mamba and KAN for
medical image segmentation while introducing an innovative and computationally
efficient feature extraction framework. The code is available at:

Result: 在50名患者和公开数据集上测试，预测肺和心脏运动的效果优于现有基准。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提升放疗前规划精度，实现更精准的放射治疗。

Abstract: Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time,
patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological
factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for
ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ
motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using
principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration
quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion
modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely
resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural
language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based
on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future
organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion
prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific
motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before
treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases
are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior
phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT
scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a
public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple
scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the
motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results
highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in
radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.

Conclusion: LowBridge框架简单高效，具有与先进模型结合的潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the task of cross-modal medical image segmentation by
exploring unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches. We propose a
model-agnostic UDA framework, LowBridge, which builds on a simple observation
that cross-modal images share some similar low-level features (e.g., edges) as
they are depicting the same structures. Specifically, we first train a
generative model to recover the source images from their edge features,
followed by training a segmentation model on the generated source images,
separately. At test time, edge features from the target images are input to the
pretrained generative model to generate source-style target domain images,
which are then segmented using the pretrained segmentation network. Despite its
simplicity, extensive experiments on various publicly available datasets
demonstrate that \proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
eleven existing UDA approaches under different settings. Notably, further
ablation studies show that \proposed is agnostic to different types of
generative and segmentation models, suggesting its potential to be seamlessly
plugged with the most advanced models to achieve even more outstanding results
in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/LowBridge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态生物成像中，时间序列数据和时间点有限，难以学习有意义的模式。现有方法要么忽略时间先验，要么忽视其他时间序列信息。

Method: 提出一种潜在模型表示图像流形，并确保其与时间序列数据和OT先验的一致性。

Result: 结合低维流形假设和OT正则化，能够更有效地提取动态图像中的相关信息。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合低维流形和OT先验，提升了动态图像分析的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic
biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often
encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time
points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods
provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the
extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and
time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image
manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as
optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the
lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions
disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series.
OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only
individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same
image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a
low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT
regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model
representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between
this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the
time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations
with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides valuable insights in
ophthalmology, cardiology, and neurology due to high-resolution,
cross-sectional images of the retina. One critical task for ophthalmologists
using OCT is delineation of retinal layers within scans. This process is
time-consuming and prone to human bias, affecting the accuracy and reliability
of diagnoses. Previous efforts to automate delineation using deep learning face
challenges in uptake from clinicians and statisticians due to the absence of
uncertainty estimation, leading to "confidently wrong" models via
hallucinations. In this study, we address these challenges by applying Bayesian
convolutional neural networks (BCNNs) to segment an openly available OCT
imaging dataset containing 35 human retina OCTs split between healthy controls
and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian
models can be used to provide uncertainty maps of the segmentation, which can
further be used to identify highly uncertain samples that exhibit recording
artefacts such as noise or miscalibration at inference time. Our method also
allows for uncertainty-estimation for important secondary measurements such as
layer thicknesses, that are medically relevant for patients. We show that these
features come in addition to greater performance compared to similar work over
all delineations; with an overall Dice score of 95.65%. Our work brings greater
clinical applicability, statistical robustness, and performance to retinal OCT
segmentation.

Conclusion: HISTAI数据集为开发临床相关计算病理学解决方案提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Digital Pathology (DP), particularly through
artificial intelligence and Foundation Models, have underscored the importance
of large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets. Despite their critical
role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient
scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the
robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the
HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over
60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is
accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic
information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic
coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources,
promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically
relevant computational pathology solutions. The dataset can be accessed at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合卷积结构和Transformer架构的创新模型CTLformer，用于低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪。通过多尺度注意力机制和动态注意力控制机制，模型有效捕捉多尺度特征并适应噪声分布，显著提升了去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT图像常伴随显著噪声，影响图像质量和诊断准确性。现有方法在多尺度特征融合和噪声分布多样性方面存在挑战。

Method: CTLformer结合卷积结构和Transformer架构，提出多尺度注意力机制和动态注意力控制机制，并通过重叠推理减少边界伪影。

Result: 在2016 NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT数据集上，CTLformer在去噪性能和模型效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CTLformer为LDCT去噪提供了高效解决方案，并在处理复杂噪声模式的医学图像分析中展现出广泛潜力。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) images are often accompanied by significant noise, which
negatively impacts image quality and subsequent diagnostic accuracy. To address
the challenges of multi-scale feature fusion and diverse noise distribution
patterns in LDCT denoising, this paper introduces an innovative model,
CTLformer, which combines convolutional structures with transformer
architecture. Two key innovations are proposed: a multi-scale attention
mechanism and a dynamic attention control mechanism. The multi-scale attention
mechanism, implemented through the Token2Token mechanism and self-attention
interaction modules, effectively captures both fine details and global
structures at different scales, enhancing relevant features and suppressing
noise. The dynamic attention control mechanism adapts the attention
distribution based on the noise characteristics of the input image, focusing on
high-noise regions while preserving details in low-noise areas, thereby
enhancing robustness and improving denoising performance. Furthermore,
CTLformer integrates convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction and
uses overlapping inference to mitigate boundary artifacts, further
strengthening its denoising capability. Experimental results on the 2016
National Institutes of Health AAPM Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset
demonstrate that CTLformer significantly outperforms existing methods in both
denoising performance and model efficiency, greatly improving the quality of
LDCT images. The proposed CTLformer not only provides an efficient solution for
LDCT denoising but also shows broad potential in medical image analysis,
especially for clinical applications dealing with complex noise patterns.

Conclusion: 元数据引导的基础模型在视网膜疾病分析中具有重要意义。

Abstract: Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis
by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data
while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal
image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is
often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is
widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease
progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we
propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware
learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce
Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata
representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs,
associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against
non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we
propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively
applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking
ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained
pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across
diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data,
indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal
disease analysis. Our code and pretrained model are available at

Conclusion: MEDL通过多源证据融合和渐进学习策略，有效解决了伪标签质量不均问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised medical segmentation co-learning frameworks have
realized that model performance can be diminished by the biases in model
recognition caused by low-quality pseudo-labels. Due to the averaging nature of
their pseudo-label integration strategy, they fail to explore the reliability
of pseudo-labels from different sources. In this paper, we propose a mutual
evidential deep learning (MEDL) framework that offers a potentially viable
solution for pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning from two
perspectives. First, we introduce networks with different architectures to
generate complementary evidence for unlabeled samples and adopt an improved
class-aware evidential fusion to guide the confident synthesis of evidential
predictions sourced from diverse architectural networks. Second, utilizing the
uncertainty in the fused evidence, we design an asymptotic Fisher
information-based evidential learning strategy. This strategy enables the model
to initially focus on unlabeled samples with more reliable pseudo-labels,
gradually shifting attention to samples with lower-quality pseudo-labels while
avoiding over-penalization of mislabeled classes in high data uncertainty
samples. Additionally, for labeled data, we continue to adopt an
uncertainty-driven asymptotic learning strategy, gradually guiding the model to
focus on challenging voxels. Extensive experiments on five mainstream datasets
have demonstrated that MEDL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在Natural Scenes数据集上，FreqSelect显著提升了重建质量，并揭示了大脑对不同频率的响应模式。

Conclusion: FreqSelect不仅提高了解码精度，还为神经科学研究提供了新的解释性工具。

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch
between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of
fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational
autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat
all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment
forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise
simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a
lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands
before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most
predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative,
FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural
data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines
and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes
dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both
low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned
frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different
visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across
subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging
modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy
and neuroscientific interpretability.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a product-of-experts-type model that
encompasses many standard prior and posterior distributions commonly found in
Bayesian imaging. We show that this model can be easily lifted into a novel
latent variable model, which we refer to as a Gaussian latent machine. This
leads to a general sampling approach that unifies and generalizes many existing
sampling algorithms in the literature. Most notably, it yields a highly
efficient and effective two-block Gibbs sampling approach in the general case,
while also specializing to direct sampling algorithms in particular cases.
Finally, we present detailed numerical experiments that demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed sampling approach across a wide
range of prior and posterior sampling problems from Bayesian imaging.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, labelled retinal imaging data, which presents a
significant challenge in the development of machine learning models for
ophthalmology, hinders progress in the field. To synthesise Colour Fundus
Photographs (CFPs), existing methods primarily relying on predefined disease
labels face significant limitations. However, current methods remain limited,
thus failing to generate images for broader categories with diverse and
fine-grained anatomical structures. To overcome these challenges, we first
introduce an innovative pipeline that creates a large-scale, synthetic
Caption-CFP dataset comprising 1.4 million entries, called RetinaLogos-1400k.
Specifically, RetinaLogos-1400k uses large language models (LLMs) to describe
retinal conditions and key structures, such as optic disc configuration,
vascular distribution, nerve fibre layers, and pathological features.
Furthermore, based on this dataset, we employ a novel three-step training
framework, called RetinaLogos, which enables fine-grained semantic control over
retinal images and accurately captures different stages of disease progression,
subtle anatomical variations, and specific lesion types. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with 62.07%
of text-driven synthetic images indistinguishable from real ones by
ophthalmologists. Moreover, the synthetic data improves accuracy by 10%-25% in
diabetic retinopathy grading and glaucoma detection, thereby providing a
scalable solution to augment ophthalmic datasets.

Abstract: This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of
pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the
segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is
due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve
the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study,
the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result,
are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards
bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from
94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the
amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of
U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and
compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score,
Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The
results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of
the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an
algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the
position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ
pathologies.

Conclusion: 比率损失函数有效提升了dMRI超分辨率成像的质量，为临床诊断提供了更准确的扩散指标。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is essential for studying brain microstructure, but
high-resolution imaging remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs
between acquisition time and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Conventional methods
often optimize only the diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) without considering
their relationship with the non-diffusion-weighted (b=0) reference images.
However, calculating diffusion metrics, such as the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) and diffusion tensor with its derived metrics like fractional
anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), relies on the ratio between each DWI
and the b=0 image, which is crucial for clinical observation and diagnostics.
In this study, we demonstrate that solely enhancing DWIs using a conventional
pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss is insufficient, as the error in ratio
between generated DWIs and b=0 diverges. We propose a novel ratio loss, defined
as the MSE loss between the predicted and ground-truth log of DWI/b=0 ratios.
Our results show that incorporating the ratio loss significantly improves the
convergence of this ratio error, achieving lower ratio MSE and slightly
enhancing the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of generated DWIs. This leads
to improved dMRI super-resolution and better preservation of b=0 ratio-based
features for the derivation of diffusion metrics.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，PSNR提升高达2dB，同时保持与CDC相当的LPIPS和FID分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了保真度和感知质量，并可扩展至视频压缩。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models achieved impressive results on several image
generation tasks often outperforming GAN based models. Recently, the generative
capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image
compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods
is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping
in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when
compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for
fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for
perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder
network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After
using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for
distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction
for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we
achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable
LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the
approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar
results.

Abstract: Accurately registering breast MR images from different time points enables
the alignment of anatomical structures and tracking of tumor progression,
supporting more effective breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment
planning. However, the complexity of dense tissue and its highly non-rigid
nature pose challenges for conventional registration methods, which primarily
focus on aligning general structures while overlooking intricate internal
details. To address this, we propose \textbf{GuidedMorph}, a novel two-stage
registration framework designed to better align dense tissue. In addition to a
single-scale network for global structure alignment, we introduce a framework
that utilizes dense tissue information to track breast movement. The learned
transformation fields are fused by introducing the Dual Spatial Transformer
Network (DSTN), improving overall alignment accuracy. A novel warping method
based on the Euclidean distance transform (EDT) is also proposed to accurately
warp the registered dense tissue and breast masks, preserving fine structural
details during deformation. The framework supports paradigms that require
external segmentation models and with image data only. It also operates
effectively with the VoxelMorph and TransMorph backbones, offering a versatile
solution for breast registration. We validate our method on ISPY2 and internal
dataset, demonstrating superior performance in dense tissue, overall breast
alignment, and breast structural similarity index measure (SSIM), with notable
improvements by over 13.01% in dense tissue Dice, 3.13% in breast Dice, and
1.21% in breast SSIM compared to the best learning-based baseline.

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used in applications ranging from image
generation to inverse problems. However, training diffusion models typically
requires clean ground-truth images, which are unavailable in many applications.
We introduce the Measurement Score-based diffusion Model (MSM), a novel
framework that learns partial measurement scores using only noisy and
subsampled measurements. MSM models the distribution of full measurements as an
expectation over partial scores induced by randomized subsampling. To make the
MSM representation computationally efficient, we also develop a stochastic
sampling algorithm that generates full images by using a randomly selected
subset of partial scores at each step. We additionally propose a new posterior
sampling method for solving inverse problems that reconstructs images using
these partial scores. We provide a theoretical analysis that bounds the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions induced by full and
stochastic sampling, establishing the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of MSM on natural images and multi-coil MRI,
showing that it can generate high-quality images and solve inverse problems --
all without access to clean training data. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO方法依赖特定基的闭式解，限制了SSMs的多样性。SaFARi框架通过支持任意框架（包括非正交和冗余框架）解决了这一问题。

Method: WaLRUS基于Daubechies小波实现SaFARi框架，构建SSMs。

Result: WaLRUS扩展了SSM家族的可能性，支持无限多样的“物种”。

Conclusion: WaLRUS为长程依赖建模提供了更灵活的工具，扩展了SSMs的应用范围。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling
long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as
HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine
learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form
solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework
generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary
frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite
diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we
introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new
implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.

### [867] [Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750)
*Zhanxiang Hua,Ryan Sobash,David John Gagne II,Yingkai Sha,Alexandra Anderson-Frey*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于解码器-仅变压器网络的新方法，用于后处理AI天气预报（如Pangu-Weather模型），以提高中程（1-8天）恶劣天气预测能力。相比传统方法，该方法将预报时间视为序列标记，学习复杂时间关系，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高中程恶劣天气预测能力对减少社会影响至关重要。传统后处理方法使用密集神经网络处理离散预报样本，无法有效捕捉时间关系。

Method: 采用解码器-仅变压器网络，将预报时间作为序列标记处理，学习大气状态的复杂时间关系。与传统密集神经网络及GFS后处理方法对比。

Result: 基于变压器的后处理方法显著优于密集神经网络。Pangu-Weather模型在高分辨率分析下表现优于GFS，即使未使用对流参数。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了中程恶劣天气预测的准确性和可靠性，并通过特征归因分析提供可解释性。

Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is
crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach
leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather
forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe
weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense
neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete
forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential
``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships
within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against
post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional
dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that
exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the
Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based
post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural
networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather
initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS
in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach
offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability
through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather
prediction capabilities.

Result: 算法在RL策略和概率模型变体中有效提取了简洁的PLTL规范。

Conclusion: 新方法能自动高效地提取PLTL规范，适用于随机行为系统的特征描述。

Abstract: There has been substantial progress in the inference of formal behavioural
specifications from sample trajectories, for example, using Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL). However, these techniques cannot handle specifications that
correctly characterise systems with stochastic behaviour, which occur commonly
in reinforcement learning and formal verification. We consider the passive
learning problem of inferring a Boolean combination of probabilistic LTL (PLTL)
formulas from a set of Markov chains, classified as either positive or
negative. We propose a novel learning algorithm that infers concise PLTL
specifications, leveraging grammar-based enumeration, search heuristics,
probabilistic model checking and Boolean set-cover procedures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm in two use cases: learning from policies
induced by RL algorithms and learning from variants of a probabilistic model.
In both cases, our method automatically and efficiently extracts PLTL
specifications that succinctly characterise the temporal differences between
the policies or model variants.

Motivation: 当前机器学习领域缺乏统一的形式化理论框架，且可解释性和伦理安全性存在不足。

Method: 通过构建形式化信息模型，利用良构公式集定义机器学习组件的本体状态和载体映射，引入可学习和可处理的谓词及函数分析因果链的逻辑推理和约束规则。

Conclusion: 该研究克服了碎片化研究的局限，为机器学习中的关键挑战提供了统一的理论基础。

Abstract: [Objective] This study focuses on addressing the current lack of a unified
formal theoretical framework in machine learning, as well as the deficiencies
in interpretability and ethical safety assurance. [Methods] A formal
information model is first constructed, utilizing sets of well-formed formulas
to explicitly define the ontological states and carrier mappings of typical
components in machine learning. Learnable and processable predicates, along
with learning and processing functions, are introduced to analyze the logical
deduction and constraint rules of the causal chains within models. [Results] A
meta-framework for machine learning theory (MLT-MF) is established. Based on
this framework, universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical
safety are proposed. Furthermore, three key theorems are proved: the
equivalence of model interpretability and information recoverability, the
assurance of ethical safety, and the estimation of generalization error.
[Limitations] The current framework assumes ideal conditions with noiseless
information-enabling mappings and primarily targets model learning and
processing logic in static scenarios. It does not yet address information
fusion and conflict resolution across ontological spaces in multimodal or
multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This work overcomes the limitations of
fragmented research and provides a unified theoretical foundation for
systematically addressing the critical challenges currently faced in machine
learning.

Result: 结果显示线性ML方法（如后Lasso）表现良好，而非线性方法（如随机森林、神经网络）可能导致第二阶段的估计偏差超过内生OLS的偏差。

Conclusion: 结论指出，ML在2SLS中的应用需谨慎选择方法，线性方法更可靠，而非线性方法可能带来负面影响。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) primarily evolved to solve "prediction problems." The
first stage of two-stage least squares (2SLS) is a prediction problem,
suggesting potential gains from ML first-stage assistance. However, little
guidance exists on when ML helps 2SLS$\unicode{x2014}$or when it hurts. We
investigate the implications of inserting ML into 2SLS, decomposing the bias

issues common to prediction and causal-inference settings$\unicode{x2014}$and
their interaction. Through simulation, we show linear ML methods (e.g.,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SNN在生物启发计算和低功耗处理方面具有潜力，但其硬件加速器设计尚未得到充分关注，尤其是如何利用其固有的时空稀疏性。

Method: 开发了一种基于脉动阵列的SNN加速器SpikeX，通过高效数据流减少内存访问并提升硬件利用率，同时提出网络与硬件协同优化方法。

Result: SpikeX显著降低了能耗和延迟，能量延迟积（EDP）减少了15.1x-150.87x，且不影响模型精度。

Conclusion: 通过端到端的网络/加速器协同设计，SpikeX为SNN的高效硬件实现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising biologically plausible models of
computation which utilize a spiking binary activation function similar to that
of biological neurons. SNNs are well positioned to process spatiotemporal data,
and are advantageous in ultra-low power and real-time processing. Despite a
large body of work on conventional artificial neural network accelerators, much
less attention has been given to efficient SNN hardware accelerator design. In
particular, SNNs exhibit inherent unstructured spatial and temporal firing
sparsity, an opportunity yet to be fully explored for great hardware processing
efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel systolic-array SNN accelerator
architecture, called SpikeX, to take on the challenges and opportunities
stemming from unstructured sparsity while taking into account the unique
characteristics of spike-based computation. By developing an efficient dataflow
targeting expensive multi-bit weight data movements, SpikeX reduces memory
access and increases data sharing and hardware utilization for computations
spanning across both time and space, thereby significantly improving energy
efficiency and inference latency. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of
SNN network and hardware co-design, we develop a co-optimization methodology
facilitating not only hardware-aware SNN training but also hardware accelerator
architecture search, allowing joint network weight parameter optimization and
accelerator architectural reconfiguration. This end-to-end network/accelerator
co-design approach offers a significant reduction of 15.1x-150.87x in
energy-delay-product(EDP) without comprising model accuracy.

Motivation: 现有MILP实例生成方法需要为每个问题类别训练单独模型且计算成本高，限制了学习型求解器的性能提升。

Method: 将MILP实例生成任务转化为代码生成任务，引入MILP-EmbedSim度量不同规模实例的相似性，并设计MILP-Retrieval管道从库中检索生成代码。

Result: MILP-Retrieval在代码生成和实例生成任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为MILP实例生成提供了新视角，并为学习型求解器开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is widely used in fields such as
scheduling, logistics, and planning. Enhancing the performance of MILP solvers,
particularly learning-based solvers, requires substantial amounts of
high-quality data. However, existing methods for MILP instance generation
typically necessitate training a separate model for each problem class and are
computationally intensive when generating new instances. To address these
limitations, we reformulate the MILP Instance Generation task as MILP Code
Generation task, enabling efficient, flexible, and interpretable instance
generation through code. Since MILP instances generated from code can vary
significantly in scale, we introduce MILP-EmbedSim, a new similarity metric
that accurately measures the similarity between instances of varying sizes
within the same problem class. Leveraging this metric, we propose
MILP-Retrieval, a pipeline that retrieves generation code from library to
produce MILP instances highly similar to target instance. MILP-Retrieval
outperforms baselines in both MILP Code Generation and Instance Generation
tasks, provides a novel perspective on MILP instance generation and opens new
possibilities for learning-based solvers.

Abstract: We propose a unified deep meta-learning framework for accelerated magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) that jointly addresses multi-coil reconstruction and
cross-modality synthesis. Motivated by the limitations of conventional methods
in handling undersampled data and missing modalities, our approach unrolls a
provably convergent optimization algorithm into a structured neural network
architecture. Each phase of the network mimics a step of an adaptive
forward-backward scheme with extrapolation, enabling the model to incorporate
both data fidelity and nonconvex regularization in a principled manner. To
enhance generalization across different acquisition settings, we integrate
meta-learning, which enables the model to rapidly adapt to unseen sampling
patterns and modality combinations using task-specific meta-knowledge. The
proposed method is evaluated on the open source datasets, showing significant
improvements in PSNR and SSIM over conventional supervised learning, especially
under aggressive undersampling and domain shifts. Our results demonstrate the
synergy of unrolled optimization, task-aware meta-learning, and modality
fusion, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world clinical
MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 随着变量规模增大，Riemannian优化中的回缩操作计算成本过高，限制了其在大规模问题中的应用。

Result: 理论分析了方法的收敛性，并在多种问题上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了Riemannian优化的可扩展性，适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Optimization with orthogonality constraints frequently arises in various
fields such as machine learning. Riemannian optimization offers a powerful
framework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a
Riemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the
manifold. This approach typically involves computing a search direction in the
tangent space and updating variables via a retraction operation. However, as
the size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction
can become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian
optimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance
scalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random
submanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity. We
introduce two sampling strategies for selecting the random submanifolds and
theoretically analyze the convergence of the proposed methods. We provide
convergence results for general nonconvex functions and functions that satisfy
Riemannian Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition as well as for stochastic optimization
settings. Additionally, we demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to
quotient manifolds derived from the orthogonal manifold. Extensive experiments
verify the benefits of the proposed method, across a wide variety of problems.

Motivation: 研究哈密顿流优化（HF-opt）及其随机化版本（RHF）的收敛性能，探索其在优化问题中的潜力。

Method: HF-opt模拟哈密顿动力学并重置速度以优化目标函数；RHF通过随机化积分时间实现加速收敛；RHGD是RHF的离散时间实现。

Result: RHF在连续时间中实现加速收敛；RHGD在离散时间中与AGD性能相当，某些情况下更优。

Conclusion: RHGD是一种高效的优化算法，性能与经典加速方法相当甚至更优，适用于强凸和弱凸函数优化。

Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian flow for optimization (HF-opt), which simulates the
Hamiltonian dynamics for some integration time and resets the velocity to $0$
to decrease the objective function; this is the optimization analogue of the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling. For short integration time,
HF-opt has the same convergence rates as gradient descent for minimizing
strongly and weakly convex functions. We show that by randomizing the
integration time in HF-opt, the resulting randomized Hamiltonian flow (RHF)
achieves accelerated convergence rates in continuous time, similar to the rates
for the accelerated gradient flow. We study a discrete-time implementation of
RHF as the randomized Hamiltonian gradient descent (RHGD) algorithm. We prove
that RHGD achieves the same accelerated convergence rates as Nesterov's
accelerated gradient descent (AGD) for minimizing smooth strongly and weakly
convex functions. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate that RHGD is
competitive with classical accelerated methods such as AGD across all settings
and outperforms them in certain regimes.

Conclusion: 提出的离散状态采样算法有效且通用，适用于复杂分布采样，无需归一化常数。

Abstract: We propose a class of discrete state sampling algorithms based on Nesterov's
accelerated gradient method, which extends the classical Metropolis-Hastings
(MH) algorithm. The evolution of the discrete states probability distribution
governed by MH can be interpreted as a gradient descent direction of the
Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, via a mobility function and a score
function. Specifically, this gradient is defined on a probability simplex
equipped with a discrete Wasserstein-2 metric with a mobility function. This
motivates us to study a momentum-based acceleration framework using damped
Hamiltonian flows on the simplex set, whose stationary distribution matches the
discrete target distribution. Furthermore, we design an interacting particle
system to approximate the proposed accelerated sampling dynamics. The extension
of the algorithm with a general choice of potentials and mobilities is also
discussed. In particular, we choose the accelerated gradient flow of the
relative Fisher information, demonstrating the advantages of the algorithm in
estimating discrete score functions without requiring the normalizing constant
and keeping positive probabilities. Numerical examples, including sampling on a
Gaussian mixture supported on lattices or a distribution on a hypercube,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed discrete-state sampling
algorithm.

Abstract: Recent studies have made great progress in functional brain network
classification by modeling the brain as a network of Regions of Interest (ROIs)
and leveraging their connections to understand brain functionality and diagnose
mental disorders. Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional
Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been
developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the
performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does
increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy?
In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named
BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on
the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters.
Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture
both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise
spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two
public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental
results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art
performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet
effective alternatives in functional brain network classification. The code

Conclusion: OpenPros的发布旨在促进先进机器学习算法的发展，以填补性能差距，生成临床可用的高分辨率前列腺超声图像。

Abstract: Prostate cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers among men,
making its early detection critically important. Although ultrasound imaging
offers greater accessibility and cost-effectiveness compared to MRI,
traditional transrectal ultrasound methods suffer from low sensitivity,
especially in detecting anteriorly located tumors. Ultrasound computed
tomography provides quantitative tissue characterization, but its clinical
implementation faces significant challenges, particularly under anatomically
constrained limited-angle acquisition conditions specific to prostate imaging.
To address these unmet needs, we introduce OpenPros, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset explicitly developed for limited-view prostate USCT. Our
dataset includes over 280,000 paired samples of realistic 2D speed-of-sound
(SOS) phantoms and corresponding ultrasound full-waveform data, generated from
anatomically accurate 3D digital prostate models derived from real clinical
MRI/CT scans and ex vivo ultrasound measurements, annotated by medical experts.
Simulations are conducted under clinically realistic configurations using
advanced finite-difference time-domain and Runge-Kutta acoustic wave solvers,
both provided as open-source components. Through comprehensive baseline
experiments, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep learning methods surpass
traditional physics-based approaches in both inference efficiency and
reconstruction accuracy. Nevertheless, current deep learning models still fall
short of delivering clinically acceptable high-resolution images with
sufficient accuracy. By publicly releasing OpenPros, we aim to encourage the
development of advanced machine learning algorithms capable of bridging this
performance gap and producing clinically usable, high-resolution, and highly
accurate prostate ultrasound images. The dataset is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: 研究确定了易于测量的关键特征，可用于快速筛选高氧离子扩散材料。

Abstract: Explainable machine learning can help to discover new physical relationships
for material properties. To understand the material properties that govern the
activation energy for oxygen diffusion in perovskites and pyrochlores, we build
a database of experimental activation energies and apply a grouping algorithm
to the material property features. These features are then used to fit seven
different machine learning models. An ensemble consensus determines that the
most important features for predicting the activation energy are the ionicity
of the A-site bond and the partial pressure of oxygen for perovskites. For
pyrochlores, the two most important features are the A-site $s$ valence
electron count and the B-site electronegativity. The most important features
are all constructed using the weighted averages of elemental metal properties,
despite weighted averages of the constituent binary oxides being included in
our feature set. This is surprising because the material properties of the
constituent oxides are more similar to the experimentally measured properties
of perovskites and pyrochlores than the features of the metals that are chosen.
The easy-to-measure features identified in this work enable rapid screening for
new materials with fast oxide-ion diffusivity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube has
transformed information dissemination, but it has also facilitated the spread
of harmful content, particularly hate videos. Despite significant efforts to
combat hate speech, detecting these videos remains challenging due to their
often implicit nature. Current detection methods primarily rely on unimodal
approaches, which inadequately capture the complementary features across
different modalities. While multimodal techniques offer a broader perspective,
many fail to effectively integrate temporal dynamics and modality-wise
interactions essential for identifying nuanced hate content. In this paper, we
present CMFusion, an enhanced multimodal hate video detection model utilizing a
novel Channel-wise and Modality-wise Fusion Mechanism. CMFusion first extracts
features from text, audio, and video modalities using pre-trained models and
then incorporates a temporal cross-attention mechanism to capture dependencies
between video and audio streams. The learned features are then processed by
channel-wise and modality-wise fusion modules to obtain informative
representations of videos. Our extensive experiments on a real-world dataset
demonstrate that CMFusion significantly outperforms five widely used baselines
in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Comprehensive ablation
studies and parameter analyses further validate our design choices,
highlighting the model's effectiveness in detecting hate videos. The source
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/EvelynZ10/cmfusion.

### [881] [Pre-trained Prompt-driven Community Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12304)
*Li Ni,Hengkai Xu,Lin Mu,Yiwen Zhang,Wenjian Luo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: PPCS模型首次将“预训练-提示”范式引入半监督社区搜索，通过节点编码、样本生成和提示驱动微调提升搜索精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督社区检测算法通常不适用于搜索给定节点的社区，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: PPCS包含节点编码（图神经网络学习节点表示）、样本生成（选择结构相似的已知社区作为训练样本）和提示驱动微调（利用样本指导预测）。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上，PPCS性能优于基线算法，且搜索效率更高。

Conclusion: PPCS有效提升了社区搜索的准确性和效率，各组件均验证有效。

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt" paradigm is widely adopted in various graph-based
tasks and has shown promising performance in community detection. Most existing
semi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on
known ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given
query node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a
given node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised
community search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven
Community Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and
efficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample
generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding
component employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of
nodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities.
Next, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a
given node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the
initial one as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning
component leverages these samples as prompts to guide the final community
prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that
PPCS performs better than baseline algorithms. It also achieves higher
community search efficiency than semi-supervised community search baseline
methods, with ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of each component of
PPCS.

*Li Ni,Hengkai Xu,Lin Mu,Yiwen Zhang,Wenjian Luo*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合关键词和位置信息的语义-空间感知k-core社区搜索方法，解决了现有方法仅关注单一属性且忽略旅行时间变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实网络通常包含关键词和位置信息，但现有社区搜索方法仅关注单一属性，导致社区语义或空间凝聚力低，且未考虑旅行时间变化。

Method: 提出了一种精确算法和一种贪心算法，从查询节点局部扩展，避免遍历整个网络，并利用大语言模型计算关键词语义相似度。

Result: 实验表明，贪心算法在结构、语义和时间依赖性空间凝聚力方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了社区搜索的语义和空间凝聚力，同时考虑了旅行时间变化。

Abstract: Real-world networks often involve both keywords and locations, along with
travel time variations between locations due to traffic conditions. However,
most existing cohesive subgraph-based community search studies utilize a single
attribute, either keywords or locations, to identify communities. They do not
simultaneously consider both keywords and locations, which results in low
semantic or spatial cohesiveness of the detected communities, and they fail to
account for variations in travel time. Additionally, these studies traverse the
entire network to build efficient indexes, but the detected community only
involves nodes around the query node, leading to the traversal of nodes that
are not relevant to the community. Therefore, we propose the problem of
discovering semantic-spatial aware k-core, which refers to a k-core with high
semantic and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness containing the query node. To
address this problem, we propose an exact and a greedy algorithm, both of which
gradually expand outward from the query node. They are local methods that only
access the local part of the attributed network near the query node rather than
the entire network. Moreover, we design a method to calculate the semantic
similarity between two keywords using large language models. This method
alleviates the disadvantages of keyword-matching methods used in existing
community search studies, such as mismatches caused by differently expressed
synonyms and the presence of irrelevant words. Experimental results show that
the greedy algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of structural, semantic,
and time-dependent spatial cohesiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超图的谣言源检测方法HyperDet，通过交互式关系构建和特征丰富的注意力融合，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谣言源检测方法主要关注二元交互，无法充分捕捉超图中更复杂的关系结构。

Method: 采用交互式关系构建模块建模静态拓扑和动态交互，结合特征丰富的注意力融合模块学习节点表示。

Result: 实验验证表明HyperDet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HyperDet能有效建模高阶关系，提升谣言源检测性能。

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks,
particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise
interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source
detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately
address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study,
we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via
Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion.
Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction
module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions
among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which
autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a
self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations
under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive
experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach,
showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验表明，SourceDetMamba性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SourceDetMamba通过结合时序和拓扑信息，有效提升了谣言源头检测的准确性。

Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying
rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to
capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present
SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in
Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space
model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and
computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first
employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks.
Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation
process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying
propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively
capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we
propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each
node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological
context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that
SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架（VPF），用于预测议会投票结果，旨在提高政府透明度和立法效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 议会投票记录虽公开但难以解读，预测投票结果有助于简化议会工作并优化立法提案。

Method: VPF框架包含数据收集、特征整合和预测模型三部分，利用机器学习分析多国议会投票记录。

Result: VPF在预测个人投票和整体法案结果上分别达到85%和84%的准确率。

Conclusion: VPF可作为政治分析和政策研究的有效工具，提升公众对立法决策的理解。

Abstract: Keeping track of how lawmakers vote is essential for government transparency.
While many parliamentary voting records are available online, they are often
difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand legislative
behavior across parliaments and predict voting outcomes. Accurate prediction of
votes has several potential benefits, from simplifying parliamentary work by
filtering out bills with a low chance of passing to refining proposed
legislation to increase its likelihood of approval. In this study, we leverage
advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques to develop a
comprehensive framework for predicting parliamentary voting outcomes across
multiple legislatures. We introduce the Voting Prediction Framework (VPF) - a
data-driven framework designed to forecast parliamentary voting outcomes at the
individual legislator level and for entire bills. VPF consists of three key
components: (1) Data Collection - gathering parliamentary voting records from
multiple countries using APIs, web crawlers, and structured databases; (2)
Parsing and Feature Integration - processing and enriching the data with
meaningful features, such as legislator seniority, and content-based
characteristics of a given bill; and (3) Prediction Models - using machine
learning to forecast how each parliament member will vote and whether a bill is
likely to pass. The framework will be open source, enabling anyone to use or
modify the framework. To evaluate VPF, we analyzed over 5 million voting
records from five countries - Canada, Israel, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and
the USA. Our results show that VPF achieves up to 85% precision in predicting
individual votes and up to 84% accuracy in predicting overall bill outcomes.
These findings highlight VPF's potential as a valuable tool for political
analysis, policy research, and enhancing public access to legislative
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏反事实和比较，测量社会影响力具有挑战性。本文旨在通过一种新的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 结合机器学习建模和网络科学，利用合成控制方法生成社会价值的度量，并通过理论推导和模拟验证其性质。

Result: 社会价值与传统中心性度量不同，且在特定情境下验证了广义友谊悖论的存在。

Conclusion: 社会价值是一种有效的社会影响力度量方法，适用于政治行为等领域，并可通过计算优化提升效率。

Abstract: Measuring social influence is difficult due to the lack of counter-factuals
and comparisons. By combining machine learning-based modeling and network
science, we present general properties of social value, a recent measure for
social influence using synthetic control applicable to political behavior.
Social value diverges from centrality measures on in that it relies on an
external regressor to predict an output variable of interest, generates a
synthetic measure of influence, then distributes individual contribution based
on a social network. Through theoretical derivations, we show the properties of
SV under linear regression with and without interaction, across lattice
networks, power-law networks, and random graphs. A reduction in computation can
be achieved for any ensemble model. Through simulation, we find that the
generalized friendship paradox holds -- that in certain situations, your
friends have on average more influence than you do.

Result: 结果表明，SGMs可以在无限维空间中实现，并通过Cameron-Martin范数扩展了有限维的熵收敛界。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法适用于球形随机场，如Whittle-Matérn随机场。

Abstract: We adopt a Gamma and Malliavin Calculi point of view in order to generalize
Score-based diffusion Generative Models (SGMs) to an infinite-dimensional
abstract Hilbertian setting. Particularly, we define the forward noising
process using Dirichlet forms associated to the Cameron-Martin space of
Gaussian measures and Wiener chaoses; whereas by relying on an abstract
time-reversal formula, we show that the score function is a Malliavin
derivative and it corresponds to a conditional expectation. This allows us to
generalize SGMs to the infinite-dimensional setting. Moreover, we extend
existing finite-dimensional entropic convergence bounds to this Hilbertian
setting by highlighting the role played by the Cameron-Martin norm in the
Fisher information of the data distribution. Lastly, we specify our discussion
for spherical random fields, considering as source of noise a Whittle-Mat\'ern
random spherical field.

Motivation: 随着大城市的快速发展，交通拥堵问题日益严重。传统交通模型中，自组织交通堵塞会自发出现，影响大范围交通。

Method: 在Nagel-Schreckenberg元胞自动机模型中，部分汽车采用基于赋能原则的内在动机行为策略，取代默认行为。

Result: 该方法显著改善了整体交通流量，缓解了拥堵，并减少了平均交通堵塞时间。

Conclusion: 基于内在动机的分散式行为策略能有效改善交通流量，且对不确定性具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Traffic congestion has long been an ubiquitous problem that is exacerbating
with the rapid growth of megacities. In this proof-of-concept work we study
intrinsic motivation, implemented via the empowerment principle, to control
autonomous car behavior to improve traffic flow. In standard models of traffic
dynamics, self-organized traffic jams emerge spontaneously from the individual
behavior of cars, affecting traffic over long distances. Our novel car behavior
strategy improves traffic flow while still being decentralized and using only
locally available information without explicit coordination. Decentralization
is essential for various reasons, not least to be able to absorb robustly
substantial levels of uncertainty. Our scenario is based on the
well-established traffic dynamics model, the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular
automaton. In a fraction of the cars in this model, we substitute the default
behavior by empowerment, our intrinsic motivation-based method. This proposed
model significantly improves overall traffic flow, mitigates congestion, and
reduces the average traffic jam time.

Abstract: Air travel is one of the most widely used transportation services in the
United States. This paper analyzes the U.S. Flight Network (USFN) using complex
network theory by exploring how the network's topology contributes to its
efficiency and vulnerability. This is done by examining the structural
properties, degree distributions, and community structures in the network. USFN
was observed to follow power-law distribution and falls under the anomalous
regime, suggesting that the network is hub dominant. Compared to null networks,
USFN has a higher clustering coefficient and modularity. Various percolation
test revealed that USFN is vulnerable to targeted attacks and is susceptible to
complete cascading failure if one of the major hubs fails. The overall results
suggest that while the USFN is designed for efficiency, it is highly vulnerable
to disruptions. Protecting key hub airports is important to make the network
more robust and prevent large-scale failures.

Abstract: The data landscape is rich with structured data, often of high value to
organizations, driving important applications in data analysis and machine
learning. Recent progress in representation learning and generative models for
such data has led to the development of natural language interfaces to
structured data, including those leveraging text-to-SQL. Contextualizing
interactions, either through conversational interfaces or agentic components,
in structured data through retrieval-augmented generation can provide
substantial benefits in the form of freshness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
of answers. The key question is: how do we retrieve the right table(s) for the
analytical query or task at hand? To this end, we introduce TARGET: a benchmark
for evaluating TAble Retrieval for GEnerative Tasks. With TARGET we analyze the
retrieval performance of different retrievers in isolation, as well as their
impact on downstream tasks. We find that dense embedding-based retrievers far
outperform a BM25 baseline which is less effective than it is for retrieval
over unstructured text. We also surface the sensitivity of retrievers across
various metadata (e.g., missing table titles), and demonstrate a stark
variation of retrieval performance across datasets and tasks. TARGET is

Motivation: 传统图推荐系统存在两个主要问题：过度依赖低通滤波（抑制用户特定信号）和忽略时序动态。GSPRec旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GSPRec通过多跳扩散编码项目转移，使用对称拉普拉斯矩阵进行谱处理，并设计双滤波机制（高斯带通滤波提取用户级模式，低通滤波保留全局趋势）。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GSPRec平均NDCG@10提升6.77%，优于基线方法。消融实验验证了时序图增强和带通滤波的互补性。

Conclusion: GSPRec通过时序增强和频率感知滤波，显著提升了推荐性能，证明了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems are effective at modeling collaborative
patterns but often suffer from two limitations: overreliance on low-pass
filtering, which suppresses user-specific signals, and omission of sequential
dynamics in graph construction. We introduce GSPRec, a graph spectral model
that integrates temporal transitions through sequentially-informed graph
construction and applies frequency-aware filtering in the spectral domain.
GSPRec encodes item transitions via multi-hop diffusion to enable the use of
symmetric Laplacians for spectral processing. To capture user preferences, we
design a dual-filtering mechanism: a Gaussian bandpass filter to extract
mid-frequency, user-level patterns, and a low-pass filter to retain global
trends. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that GSPRec
consistently outperforms baselines, with an average improvement of 6.77% in
NDCG@10. Ablation studies show the complementary benefits of both sequential
graph augmentation and bandpass filtering.

Result: 词汇向量搜索在预测准确性和执行速度上均优于语义向量搜索。

Conclusion: 传统方法在信息检索工具包中仍具竞争力，不应被忽视。

Abstract: Classification is a common AI problem, and vector search is a typical
solution. This transforms a given body of text into a numerical representation,
known as an embedding, and modern improvements to vector search focus on
optimising speed and predictive accuracy. This is often achieved through neural
methods that aim to learn language semantics. However, our results suggest that
these are not always the best solution. Our task was to classify
rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found
that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse
predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and
that it required significantly more time to execute. These findings suggest
that traditional methods deserve to be contenders in the information retrieval
toolkit, despite the prevalence and success of neural models.

*Radek Osmulsk,Gabriel de Souza P. Moreira,Ronay Ak,Mengyao Xu,Benedikt Schifferer,Even Oldridge*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MIRACL-VISION是一个多语言视觉文档检索评估基准，扩展了MIRACL数据集，覆盖18种语言，旨在解决现有视觉文档检索评估的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉文档检索评估基准主要局限于英语、依赖合成问题且语料库规模小，无法满足多语言和复杂布局文档的需求。

Method: 通过消除语料库中的“简单”负样本，设计了一个更高效且具有挑战性的评估方法，并进行了广泛的实验比较。

Result: 实验显示，当前视觉模型在多语言能力上存在显著差距，检索准确率比文本模型低59.7%，英语环境下也低12.1%。

Conclusion: MIRACL-VISION是一个具有挑战性和代表性的多语言视觉检索评估基准，有助于推动文档检索模型的进步。

Abstract: Document retrieval is an important task for search and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have contributed to
improving the accuracy of text-based document retrieval. However, documents
with complex layout and visual elements like tables, charts and infographics
are not perfectly represented in textual format. Recently, image-based document
retrieval pipelines have become popular, which use visual large language models
(VLMs) to retrieve relevant page images given a query. Current evaluation
benchmarks on visual document retrieval are limited, as they primarily focus
only English language, rely on synthetically generated questions and offer a
small corpus size. Therefore, we introduce MIRACL-VISION, a multilingual visual
document retrieval evaluation benchmark. MIRACL-VISION covers 18 languages, and
is an extension of the MIRACL dataset, a popular benchmark to evaluate
text-based multilingual retrieval pipelines. MIRACL was built using a
human-intensive annotation process to generate high-quality questions. In order
to reduce MIRACL-VISION corpus size to make evaluation more compute friendly
while keeping the datasets challenging, we have designed a method for
eliminating the "easy" negatives from the corpus. We conducted extensive
experiments comparing MIRACL-VISION with other benchmarks, using popular public
text and image models. We observe a gap in state-of-the-art VLM-based embedding
models on multilingual capabilities, with up to 59.7% lower retrieval accuracy
than a text-based retrieval models. Even for the English language, the visual
models retrieval accuracy is 12.1% lower compared to text-based models.
MIRACL-VISION is a challenging, representative, multilingual evaluation
benchmark for visual retrieval pipelines and will help the community build
robust models for document retrieval.

*Guangyuan Ma,Yongliang Ma,Xuanrui Gou,Zhenpeng Su,Ming Zhou,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightRetriever是一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的混合检索器，通过极轻量级的查询编码器提升效率，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM显著提升了检索能力，但其深度参数化导致查询推断速度慢且在线部署资源需求高。

Method: 保留完整大小的LLM用于文档编码，但将查询编码的工作量减少至不超过嵌入查找。

Result: 相比在H800 GPU上运行完整LLM，该方法在GPU加速下实现了1000倍以上的查询推断加速，无GPU时也有20倍加速。

Conclusion: LightRetriever在多样化检索任务中表现优异，平均保留95%的完整模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based hybrid retrieval uses LLMs to encode
queries and documents into low-dimensional dense or high-dimensional sparse
vectors. It retrieves documents relevant to search queries based on vector
similarities. Documents are pre-encoded offline, while queries arrive in
real-time, necessitating an efficient online query encoder. Although LLMs
significantly enhance retrieval capabilities, serving deeply parameterized LLMs
slows down query inference throughput and increases demands for online
deployment resources. In this paper, we propose LightRetriever, a novel
LLM-based hybrid retriever with extremely lightweight query encoders. Our
method retains a full-sized LLM for document encoding, but reduces the workload
of query encoding to no more than an embedding lookup. Compared to serving a
full-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for
query inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU.
Experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method
generalizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95%
full-sized performance.

Motivation: 随着各国立法确立‘被遗忘权’，FOLTR等基于机器学习模型的服务需支持用户数据删除功能。当前评估方法单一且争议较大，需多指标综合评估。

Result: 详细分析揭示了五种策略的优缺点，为优化联邦遗忘以平衡数据隐私和系统性能提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究填补了多指标评估的空白，并公开了代码和完整结果，促进未来研究。

Abstract: This paper reports on findings from a comparative study on the effectiveness
and efficiency of federated unlearning strategies within Federated Online
Learning to Rank (FOLTR), with specific attention to systematically analysing
the unlearning capabilities of methods in a verifiable manner.
  Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered
attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded
by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources,
preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on
implicit feedback, such as clicks.
  Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the
so called "the right to be forgotten", according to which services based on
machine learning models like those in FOLTR should provide capabilities that
allow users to remove their own data from those used to train models. This has
sparked the development of unlearning methods, along with evaluation practices
to measure whether unlearning of a user data successfully occurred. Current
evaluation practices are however often controversial, necessitating the use of
multiple metrics for a more comprehensive assessment -- but previous proposals
of unlearning methods only used single evaluation metrics.
  This paper addresses this limitation: our study rigorously assesses the
effectiveness of unlearning strategies in managing both under-unlearning and
over-unlearning scenarios using adapted, and newly proposed evaluation metrics.
Thanks to our detailed analysis, we uncover the strengths and limitations of
five unlearning strategies, offering valuable insights into optimizing
federated unlearning to balance data privacy and system performance within
FOLTR. We publicly release our code and complete results at
https://github.com/Iris1026/Unlearning-for-FOLTR.git.

TL;DR: scSiameseClu是一种基于Siamese聚类框架的新方法，用于解决scRNA-seq数据中的噪声、稀疏性和高维度问题，通过双增强模块、Siamese融合模块和最优传输聚类提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: scRNA-seq数据分析面临噪声、稀疏性和高维度等挑战，且现有GNN方法存在过平滑问题，限制了复杂生物信息的捕捉。

Method: 提出scSiameseClu框架，包括双增强模块（增强数据鲁棒性）、Siamese融合模块（减少过平滑）和最优传输聚类（高效对齐聚类）。

Result: 在七个真实数据集上，scSiameseClu在单细胞聚类、细胞类型注释和分类方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: scSiameseClu为scRNA-seq数据解释提供了高效工具，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals cell heterogeneity, with cell
clustering playing a key role in identifying cell types and marker genes.
Recent advances, especially graph neural networks (GNNs)-based methods, have
significantly improved clustering performance. However, the analysis of
scRNA-seq data remains challenging due to noise, sparsity, and high
dimensionality. Compounding these challenges, GNNs often suffer from
over-smoothing, limiting their ability to capture complex biological
information. In response, we propose scSiameseClu, a novel Siamese Clustering
framework for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data, comprising of 3 key steps:
(1) Dual Augmentation Module, which applies biologically informed perturbations
to the gene expression matrix and cell graph relationships to enhance
representation robustness; (2) Siamese Fusion Module, which combines
cross-correlation refinement and adaptive information fusion to capture complex
cellular relationships while mitigating over-smoothing; and (3) Optimal
Transport Clustering, which utilizes Sinkhorn distance to efficiently align
cluster assignments with predefined proportions while maintaining balance.
Comprehensive evaluations on seven real-world datasets demonstrate
that~\methodname~outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single-cell
clustering, cell type annotation, and cell type classification, providing a
powerful tool for scRNA-seq data interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在单细胞转录组学中成功，但缺乏支持scATAC-seq零样本分析和多组学整合的模型，且数据高维稀疏和开放染色质区域标准化表示不足。

Method: 采用混合架构和基因组感知标记化，预训练于30种组织和6种疾病条件下的197万细胞。

Result: 在6项任务中表现广泛适用性，零样本生成通用细胞表征，细胞类型注释和跨组学预测迁移性强，发现现有方法未检测的增强子-基因链接。

Conclusion: ChromFound为非编码基因组疾病风险变异理解提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using
sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering
regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin
accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success
in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for
scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and
comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the
high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a
standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we
present \textbf{ChromFound}, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq.
ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to
effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from
dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues
and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6
diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating
universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell
type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links
undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising
framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.

Motivation: 社交媒体API限制挑战了欧盟数字服务法案的合规性，需独立审计验证平台内容审核和算法透明度。

Method: 开发结构化审计框架，比较分析X/Twitter、Reddit、TikTok和Meta平台，识别审计盲点。

Result: 发现平台依赖AI系统却限制独立监督的“问责悖论”，提出政策干预建议。

Conclusion: 建议采用联邦访问模型和加强监管执行，以解决平台与监管的脱节问题。

Abstract: Recent application programming interface (API) restrictions on major social
media platforms challenge compliance with the EU Digital Services Act [20],
which mandates data access for algorithmic transparency. We develop a
structured audit framework to assess the growing misalignment between
regulatory requirements and platform implementations. Our comparative analysis
of X/Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, and Meta identifies critical ``audit
blind-spots'' where platform content moderation and algorithmic amplification
remain inaccessible to independent verification. Our findings reveal an
``accountability paradox'': as platforms increasingly rely on AI systems, they
simultaneously restrict the capacity for independent oversight. We propose
targeted policy interventions aligned with the AI Risk Management Framework of
the National Institute of Standards and Technology [80], emphasizing federated
access models and enhanced regulatory enforcement.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于动态维度的AI治理框架（3A：决策权、过程自主性和问责制），以替代传统的静态分类治理方法，适应AI系统的快速演进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于固定风险等级或人类监督的分类治理框架已无法适应AI系统的动态性和复杂性，尤其是基于基础模型和多智能体架构的AI系统。

Method: 提出维度治理框架，动态追踪3A（决策权、过程自主性、问责制）在人与AI关系中的分布，并监控系统跨越关键治理阈值的能力。

Result: 维度治理框架能够预先调整风险，支持更灵活的分类和阈值设置，适应新兴能力，同时保持分类的决策支持作用。

Conclusion: 维度治理为AI治理提供了更具适应性和未来性的路径，能够在动态环境中实现更灵活的治理和创新。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve from static tools to dynamic agents, traditional
categorical governance frameworks -- based on fixed risk tiers, levels of
autonomy, or human oversight models -- are increasingly insufficient on their
own. Systems built on foundation models, self-supervised learning, and
multi-agent architectures increasingly blur the boundaries that categories were
designed to police. In this Perspective, we make the case for dimensional
governance: a framework that tracks how decision authority, process autonomy,
and accountability (the 3As) distribute dynamically across human-AI
relationships. A critical advantage of this approach is its ability to
explicitly monitor system movement toward and across key governance thresholds,
enabling preemptive adjustments before risks materialize. This dimensional
approach provides the necessary foundation for more adaptive categorization,
enabling thresholds and classifications that can evolve with emerging
capabilities. While categories remain essential for decision-making, building
them upon dimensional foundations allows for context-specific adaptability and
stakeholder-responsive governance that static approaches cannot achieve. We
outline key dimensions, critical trust thresholds, and practical examples
illustrating where rigid categorical frameworks fail -- and where a dimensional
mindset could offer a more resilient and future-proof path forward for both
governance and innovation at the frontier of artificial intelligence.

Method: 通过分析瑞士Smartvote数据，测量操纵策略的影响，并提出对抗鲁棒性属性和评估指标。

Result: 操纵参数可显著改变政党推荐频率（最高达261%），揭示了VAAs的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 需增强VAAs的对抗鲁棒性，确保未来AI驱动的VAAs安全可靠。

Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs) help millions of voters understand which
political parties or candidates best align with their views. This paper
explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process
when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation
strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland's primary VAA,
Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that
altering application parameters, such as the matching method, can shift a
party's recommendation frequency by up to 105%. Cherry-picking questionnaire
items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261%, while subtle
changes to parties' or candidates' responses can lead to a 248% increase. To
address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties
VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience
of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward
mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure
and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.

Motivation: 研究现实世界中人们对未来收益的模糊认知，以及语言在传达这种模糊信息中的重要性。

Method: 通过分析分析师报告中的文本语气和数值预测，研究其对预测误差和修订的影响。

Result: 文本语气对预测误差和修订有预测能力，尤其在模糊语言、高不确定性和忙碌分析师的情况下更显著。

Conclusion: 研究表明，部分有用信息仅通过语言模糊传达，语言在主观预期中扮演重要角色。

Abstract: People in the real world often possess vague knowledge of future payoffs, for
which quantification is not feasible or desirable. We argue that language, with
differing ability to convey vague information, plays an important but less
known-role in subjective expectations. Empirically, we find that in their
reports, analysts include useful information in linguistic expressions but not
numerical forecasts. Specifically, the textual tone of analyst reports has
predictive power for forecast errors and subsequent revisions in numerical
forecasts, and this relation becomes stronger when analyst's language is
vaguer, when uncertainty is higher, and when analysts are busier. Overall, our
theory and evidence suggest that some useful information is vaguely known and
only communicated through language.

Conclusion: DisCoCirc为量子自然语言处理提供了新框架，并开源工具包lambeq Gen II以推动社区发展。

Abstract: Quantum approaches to natural language processing (NLP) are redefining how
linguistic information is represented and processed. While traditional hybrid
quantum-classical models rely heavily on classical neural networks, recent
advancements propose a novel framework, DisCoCirc, capable of directly encoding
entire documents as parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), besides enjoying
some additional interpretability and compositionality benefits. Following these
ideas, this paper introduces an efficient methodology for converting
large-scale texts into quantum circuits using tree-like representations of
pregroup diagrams. Exploiting the compositional parallels between language and
quantum mechanics, grounded in symmetric monoidal categories, our approach
enables faithful and efficient encoding of syntactic and discourse
relationships in long and complex texts (up to 6410 words in our experiments)
to quantum circuits. The developed system is provided to the community as part
of the augmented open-source quantum NLP package lambeq Gen II.

Motivation: 现有3D美学计算模型缺乏大规模人类判断的实证基础，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 收集22,301对比较数据，采用Bradley-Terry模型和随机森林分析几何特征（如对称性、曲率）。

Result: 揭示了美学偏好的普遍原则和领域特定趋势，并提供了公开数据集。

Conclusion: 通过人本数据驱动框架，推进了对3D形状美学的理解，为设计师提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Human aesthetic preferences for 3D shapes are central to industrial design,
virtual reality, and consumer product development. However, most computational
models of 3D aesthetics lack empirical grounding in large-scale human
judgments, limiting their practical relevance. We present a large-scale study
of human preferences. We collected 22,301 pairwise comparisons across five
object categories (chairs, tables, mugs, lamps, and dining chairs) via Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Building on a previously published
dataset~\cite{dev2020learning}, we introduce new non-linear modeling and
cross-category analysis to uncover the geometric drivers of aesthetic
preference. We apply the Bradley-Terry model to infer latent aesthetic scores
and use Random Forests with SHAP analysis to identify and interpret the most
influential geometric features (e.g., symmetry, curvature, compactness). Our
cross-category analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific
trends in aesthetic preferences. We focus on human interpretable geometric
features to ensure model transparency and actionable design insights, rather
than relying on black-box deep learning approaches. Our findings bridge
computational aesthetics and cognitive science, providing practical guidance
for designers and a publicly available dataset to support reproducibility. This
work advances the understanding of 3D shape aesthetics through a human-centric,

Motivation: 现有语言条件运动模型在场景感知运动生成方面表现不佳，主要由于运动标记化导致信息丢失和无法捕捉3D人类运动的连续性和上下文依赖性。

Method: UniHM提出混合运动表示、新型LFQ-VAE和增强版Lingo数据集，以提升运动真实性和生成性能。

Result: 实验表明，UniHM在OMOMO和HumanML3D基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: UniHM为复杂场景中的运动合成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了场景感知运动生成的能力。

Abstract: Human motion synthesis in complex scenes presents a fundamental challenge,
extending beyond conventional Text-to-Motion tasks by requiring the integration
of diverse modalities such as static environments, movable objects, natural
language prompts, and spatial waypoints. Existing language-conditioned motion
models often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in
motion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the
continuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these
issues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages
diffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is
the first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object
Interaction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key
contributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF
motion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel
Look-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in
both reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched
version of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing
stronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that UniHM achieves comparative performance on the OMOMO benchmark
for text-to-HOI synthesis and yields competitive results on HumanML3D for
general text-conditioned motion generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D大型多模态模型因空间令牌冗余导致计算效率低下，需要优化。

Method: 提出AdaToken-3D框架，通过空间贡献分析和注意力模式挖掘动态修剪冗余令牌。

Result: 在LLaVA-3D上实现21%的推理速度提升和63%的FLOPs减少，同时保持任务准确性。

Conclusion: AdaToken-3D不仅提升效率，还揭示了多模态空间信息流中的冗余模式，为高效3D多模态学习奠定理论基础。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become a pivotal research focus in deep
learning, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in 3D scene understanding.
However, current 3D LMMs employing thousands of spatial tokens for multimodal
reasoning suffer from critical inefficiencies: excessive computational overhead
and redundant information flows. Unlike 2D VLMs processing single images, 3D
LMMs exhibit inherent architectural redundancy due to the heterogeneous
mechanisms between spatial tokens and visual tokens. To address this challenge,
we propose AdaToken-3D, an adaptive spatial token optimization framework that
dynamically prunes redundant tokens through spatial contribution analysis. Our
method automatically tailors pruning strategies to different 3D LMM
architectures by quantifying token-level information flows via attention
pattern mining. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-3D (a 7B parameter 3D-LMM)
demonstrate that AdaToken-3D achieves 21\% faster inference speed and 63\%
FLOPs reduction while maintaining original task accuracy. Beyond efficiency
gains, this work systematically investigates redundancy patterns in multimodal
spatial information flows through quantitative token interaction analysis. Our
findings reveal that over 60\% of spatial tokens contribute minimally ($<$5\%)
to the final predictions, establishing theoretical foundations for efficient 3D
multimodal learning.

Abstract: We propose a neural approach for estimating spatially varying light selection
distributions to improve importance sampling in Monte Carlo rendering,
particularly for complex scenes with many light sources. Our method uses a
neural network to predict the light selection distribution at each shading
point based on local information, trained by minimizing the KL-divergence
between the learned and target distributions in an online manner. To
efficiently manage hundreds or thousands of lights, we integrate our neural
approach with light hierarchy techniques, where the network predicts
cluster-level distributions and existing methods sample lights within clusters.
Additionally, we introduce a residual learning strategy that leverages initial
distributions from existing techniques, accelerating convergence during
training. Our method achieves superior performance across diverse and
challenging scenes.

diverse demographic characteristics, we employ a mixed-effects Poisson
regression model to derive an overall fairness score. This score is integrated
with traditional metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to compute the Fairness
Adjusted ASR Score (FAAS), providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our
approach reveals significant performance disparities in SOTA ASR models across

TL;DR: SepPrune是一个结构化剪枝框架，用于压缩深度语音分离模型并降低计算成本，通过可学习的剪枝策略显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注语音分离质量而忽视计算效率，SepPrune旨在解决这一问题，适用于实时低延迟语音处理。

Method: 分析模型计算结构，识别高计算负担层；引入可微分掩码策略进行梯度驱动的通道选择；剪枝冗余通道并微调剩余参数。

Result: SepPrune在语音分离模型中表现优异，仅需一轮微调即可恢复85%性能，收敛速度比从头训练快36倍。

Conclusion: SepPrune为语音分离模型的高效剪枝提供了有效解决方案，显著提升计算效率且性能损失小。

Abstract: Although deep learning has substantially advanced speech separation in recent
years, most existing studies continue to prioritize separation quality while
overlooking computational efficiency, an essential factor for low-latency
speech processing in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose
SepPrune, the first structured pruning framework specifically designed to
compress deep speech separation models and reduce their computational cost.
SepPrune begins by analyzing the computational structure of a given model to
identify layers with the highest computational burden. It then introduces a
differentiable masking strategy to enable gradient-driven channel selection.
Based on the learned masks, SepPrune prunes redundant channels and fine-tunes
the remaining parameters to recover performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this learnable pruning paradigm yields substantial advantages
for channel pruning in speech separation models, outperforming existing
methods. Notably, a model pruned with SepPrune can recover 85% of the
performance of a pre-trained model (trained over hundreds of epochs) with only
one epoch of fine-tuning, and achieves convergence 36$\times$ faster than
training from scratch. Code is available at

*Qianyue Hu,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: VoiceCloak是一种针对扩散模型（DMs）的多维主动防御框架，通过对抗扰动破坏未经授权的语音克隆（VC），保护说话人身份并降低语音质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语音克隆中表现出色，但也增加了恶意滥用的风险。现有防御方法不适用于扩散模型，因此需要开发新的防御框架。

Method: VoiceCloak通过分析扩散模型的漏洞，引入对抗扰动，扭曲说话人身份表示并破坏关键条件引导过程，同时通过噪声引导语义破坏降低输出质量。

Result: 实验表明，VoiceCloak在防御基于扩散模型的语音克隆方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VoiceCloak为扩散模型提供了一种有效的主动防御解决方案，防止语音克隆的恶意使用。

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice
cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing
proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the
forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the
intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce
VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of
obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential
unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to
identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt
the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference
audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets
speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize
identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles.
Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes,
particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal
characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to
address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude
amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation
of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to
disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality.
Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate
against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak
are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

TL;DR: MMAR是一个新的音频-语言模型（ALMs）深度推理能力评估基准，包含1000个高质量音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖多领域任务和复杂推理层次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频基准局限于特定领域，缺乏对多模态和深度推理的评估，MMAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MMAR通过精心筛选和迭代修正构建，问题分为四个推理层次（信号、感知、语义、文化），并标注Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理链。

Result: 评估显示当前模型（如LALMs、LLMs）在MMAR上表现有限，揭示了理解和推理能力的不足。

Conclusion: MMAR为音频推理研究提供了新方向，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: We introduce MMAR, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the deep reasoning
capabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) across massive multi-disciplinary
tasks. MMAR comprises 1,000 meticulously curated audio-question-answer
triplets, collected from real-world internet videos and refined through
iterative error corrections and quality checks to ensure high quality. Unlike
existing benchmarks that are limited to specific domains of sound, music, or
speech, MMAR extends them to a broad spectrum of real-world audio scenarios,
including mixed-modality combinations of sound, music, and speech. Each
question in MMAR is hierarchically categorized across four reasoning layers:
Signal, Perception, Semantic, and Cultural, with additional sub-categories
within each layer to reflect task diversity and complexity. To further foster
research in this area, we annotate every question with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
rationale to promote future advancements in audio reasoning. Each item in the
benchmark demands multi-step deep reasoning beyond surface-level understanding.
Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and
domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. We
evaluate MMAR using a broad set of models, including Large Audio-Language
Models (LALMs), Large Audio Reasoning Models (LARMs), Omni Language Models
(OLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), with
audio caption inputs. The performance of these models on MMAR highlights the
benchmark's challenging nature, and our analysis further reveals critical
limitations of understanding and reasoning capabilities among current models.
We hope MMAR will serve as a catalyst for future advances in this important but
little-explored area.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的多模态音乐翻译方法，通过大规模数据集和统一的分词框架，显著提升了跨模态翻译任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法针对每种音乐模态翻译任务训练专门模型，效率低下且难以泛化。本文旨在通过统一模型解决多模态翻译问题。

Method: 使用大规模数据集（1300小时音频-乐谱图像对）和统一的分词框架，将不同模态离散化为令牌序列，采用编码器-解码器Transformer模型。

Result: 统一模型在多个任务中优于单任务基线，如光学音乐识别的符号错误率从24.58%降至13.67%，并首次实现乐谱图像到音频的生成。

Conclusion: 统一方法在多模态音乐翻译中表现出色，为跨模态音乐生成提供了突破性进展。

Abstract: Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores,
MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core
tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription
(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).
However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on
individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,
where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks
simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new
large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose
a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score
image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger
than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified
tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into
a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle
multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.
Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon
single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error
rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,
while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other
translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful
score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in
cross-modal music generation.

TL;DR: Text2midi-InferAlign通过推理时的文本-音频对齐和音乐结构对齐奖励，提升符号音乐生成的质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号音乐生成模型在推理时缺乏与输入文本的一致性，导致生成音乐质量不高。

Method: 引入文本-音频一致性评分和和声一致性评分，优化生成过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在Text2midi模型上验证，客观和主观评估指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至现有自回归模型，提升生成音乐与文本的一致性。

Abstract: We present Text2midi-InferAlign, a novel technique for improving symbolic
music generation at inference time. Our method leverages text-to-audio
alignment and music structural alignment rewards during inference to encourage
the generated music to be consistent with the input caption. Specifically, we
introduce two objectives scores: a text-audio consistency score that measures
rhythmic alignment between the generated music and the original text caption,
and a harmonic consistency score that penalizes generated music containing
notes inconsistent with the key. By optimizing these alignment-based objectives
during the generation process, our model produces symbolic music that is more
closely tied to the input captions, thereby improving the overall quality and
coherence of the generated compositions. Our approach can extend any existing
autoregressive model without requiring further training or fine-tuning. We
evaluate our work on top of Text2midi - an existing text-to-midi generation
model, demonstrating significant improvements in both objective and subjective
evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的地理上下文声音景观到景观（GeoS2L）生成方法，通过结合地理知识生成真实的地理景观图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频到图像生成方法忽略地理和环境上下文，导致生成图像与现实环境不符。

Method: 提出了一种地理上下文计算框架，构建了两个大规模数据集（SoundingSVI和SonicUrban），并开发了基于扩散变换器（DiT）的SounDiT模型。

Result: SounDiT在视觉保真度和地理一致性上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究为GeoS2L生成奠定了基础，并强调了地理知识在多模态生成模型中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a novel and practically significant problem-Geo-Contextual
Soundscape-to-Landscape (GeoS2L) generation-which aims to synthesize
geographically realistic landscape images from environmental soundscapes. Prior
audio-to-image generation methods typically rely on general-purpose datasets
and overlook geographic and environmental contexts, resulting in unrealistic
images that are misaligned with real-world environmental settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce a novel geo-contextual computational framework
that explicitly integrates geographic knowledge into multimodal generative
modeling. We construct two large-scale geo-contextual multimodal datasets,
SoundingSVI and SonicUrban, pairing diverse soundscapes with real-world
landscape images. We propose SounDiT, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based
model that incorporates geo-contextual scene conditioning to synthesize
geographically coherent landscape images. Furthermore, we propose a
practically-informed geo-contextual evaluation framework, the Place Similarity
Score (PSS), across element-, scene-, and human perception-levels to measure
consistency between input soundscapes and generated landscape images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SounDiT outperforms existing baselines in both
visual fidelity and geographic settings. Our work not only establishes
foundational benchmarks for GeoS2L generation but also highlights the
importance of incorporating geographic domain knowledge in advancing multimodal
generative models, opening new directions at the intersection of generative AI,
geography, urban planning, and environmental sciences.

TL;DR: OZSpeech是一种基于最优传输条件流匹配的单步采样TTS方法，通过解耦语音属性并减少采样步骤，提升了语音合成的准确性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTS方法在语音表示和计算成本上存在局限性，OZSpeech旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用最优传输条件流匹配框架，结合单步采样和学习先验条件，对解耦的语音属性进行建模。

Result: 实验表明，OZSpeech在内容准确性、自然度、韵律生成和说话人风格保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OZSpeech为TTS系统提供了一种高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent
years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network
architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous
approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms
or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods
have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring
high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during
training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS
method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step
sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding
preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach
operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format,
enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS
system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results
show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in
content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style
preservation. Audio samples are available at our demo page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋噪声污染日益严重，亟需监测和分类噪声源，但高质量标记数据稀缺，无监督学习成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 采用基于Conformer编码器的无监督对比学习方法，利用低质量未标记数据优化模型，并通过分类任务验证其性能。

Result: 方法在识别船舶类型和海洋哺乳动物发声任务中表现出色，证明了无监督学习的潜力。

Conclusion: 无监督学习方法为水下声学分析提供了新的可能性，尤其在标记数据稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: The increasing level of sound pollution in marine environments poses an
increased threat to ocean health, making it crucial to monitor underwater
noise. By monitoring this noise, the sources responsible for this pollution can
be mapped. Monitoring is performed by passively listening to these sounds. This
generates a large amount of data records, capturing a mix of sound sources such
as ship activities and marine mammal vocalizations. Although machine learning
offers a promising solution for automatic sound classification, current
state-of-the-art methods implement supervised learning. This requires a large
amount of high-quality labeled data that is not publicly available. In
contrast, a massive amount of lower-quality unlabeled data is publicly
available, offering the opportunity to explore unsupervised learning
techniques. This research explores this possibility by implementing an
unsupervised Contrastive Learning approach. Here, a Conformer-based encoder is
optimized by the so-called Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization loss
function on these lower-quality unlabeled data and the translation to the
labeled data is made. Through classification tasks involving recognizing ship
types and marine mammal vocalizations, our method demonstrates to produce
robust and generalized embeddings. This shows to potential of unsupervised
methods for various automatic underwater acoustic analysis tasks.

Motivation: 现有音频书系统需要手动配置说话者的韵律、语调单调或依赖昂贵训练，限制了生成效果和效率。

Method: 提出两种新方法：MSP（多模态说话者角色生成）和LSI（基于LLM的脚本指令生成），以自动生成情感丰富的音频书。

Result: 通过与商业产品比较（人类和MLLM评估），取得了竞争性结果，并通过消融实验验证了MSP和LSI的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiActor-Audiobook在无需额外训练的情况下，能够生成高质量、情感丰富的音频书，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce MultiActor-Audiobook, a zero-shot approach for generating
audiobooks that automatically produces consistent, expressive, and
speaker-appropriate prosody, including intonation and emotion. Previous
audiobook systems have several limitations: they require users to manually
configure the speaker's prosody, read each sentence with a monotonic tone
compared to voice actors, or rely on costly training. However, our
MultiActor-Audiobook addresses these issues by introducing two novel processes:
(1) MSP (**Multimodal Speaker Persona Generation**) and (2) LSI (**LLM-based
Script Instruction Generation**). With these two processes,
MultiActor-Audiobook can generate more emotionally expressive audiobooks with a
consistent speaker prosody without additional training. We compare our system
with commercial products, through human and MLLM evaluations, achieving
competitive results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MSP and
LSI through ablation studies.

Motivation: 现有因果语音分离模型因难以保留历史信息而表现不佳。

Method: TFACM结合LSTM层、缓存记忆模块和因果注意力细化模块，捕捉时空关系并存储历史信息。

Result: TFACM性能与SOTA模型TF-GridNet-Causal相当，但复杂度更低、参数更少。

Conclusion: TFACM通过高效历史信息处理，提升了因果语音分离模型的性能。

Abstract: Existing causal speech separation models often underperform compared to
non-causal models due to difficulties in retaining historical information. To
address this, we propose the Time-Frequency Attention Cache Memory (TFACM)
model, which effectively captures spatio-temporal relationships through an
attention mechanism and cache memory (CM) for historical information storage.
In TFACM, an LSTM layer captures frequency-relative positions, while causal
modeling is applied to the time dimension using local and global
representations. The CM module stores past information, and the causal
attention refinement (CAR) module further enhances time-based feature
representations for finer granularity. Experimental results showed that TFACM
achieveed comparable performance to the SOTA TF-GridNet-Causal model, with
significantly lower complexity and fewer trainable parameters. For more

Abstract: Even though high-level synthesis (HLS) tools mitigate the challenges of

Conclusion: 该方法为硬件资源有限的环境提供了一种高效且可扩展的自动调优解决方案。

Abstract: Accelerating Machine Learning (ML) workloads requires efficient methods due
to their large optimization space. Autotuning has emerged as an effective
approach for systematically evaluating variations of implementations.
Traditionally, autotuning requires the workloads to be executed on the target
hardware (HW). We present an interface that allows executing autotuning
workloads on simulators. This approach offers high scalability when the
availability of the target HW is limited, as many simulations can be run in
parallel on any accessible HW. Additionally, we evaluate the feasibility of
using fast instruction-accurate simulators for autotuning. We train various
predictors to forecast the performance of ML workload implementations on the
target HW based on simulation statistics. Our results demonstrate that the
tuned predictors are highly effective. The best workload implementation in
terms of actual run time on the target HW is always within the top 3 % of
predictions for the tested x86, ARM, and RISC-V-based architectures. In the
best case, this approach outperforms native execution on the target HW for
embedded architectures when running as few as three samples on three simulators
in parallel.

Motivation: 传统算法如Charikar的贪心算法仅提供1/2近似，而精确解计算复杂。学习增强算法能利用机器学习预测的部分解提升性能。

Method: 利用机器学习分类器提供的部分解（覆盖最优子图的$(1-\epsilon)$节点），设计线性时间算法实现$(1-\epsilon)$近似。

Result: 实验证明该算法在Twitch Ego Nets数据集上优于Charikar贪心算法和直接返回预测子图的基线方法。

Conclusion: 学习增强算法能高效提升最密子图问题的近似性能，且适用于有向图和NP难变体。

Abstract: We study the densest subgraph problem and its variants through the lens of
learning-augmented algorithms. For this problem, the greedy algorithm by
Charikar (APPROX 2000) provides a linear-time $ 1/2 $-approximation, while
computing the exact solution typically requires solving a linear program or
performing maximum flow computations.We show that given a partial solution,
i.e., one produced by a machine learning classifier that captures at least a $
(1 - \epsilon) $-fraction of nodes in the optimal subgraph, it is possible to
design an extremely simple linear-time algorithm that achieves a provable $ (1
- \epsilon) $-approximation. Our approach also naturally extends to the
directed densest subgraph problem and several NP-hard variants.An experiment on
the Twitch Ego Nets dataset shows that our learning-augmented algorithm
outperforms Charikar's greedy algorithm and a baseline that directly returns
the predicted densest subgraph without additional algorithmic processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来NEO发现数量激增，但NEOCP候选中仅约一半为NEO，大量观测时间浪费在非NEO上，且约11%候选因观测不足未确认。

Method: 分析30种digest2参数类别，设计过滤机制排除20%非NEO；应用四种机器学习模型（GBM、RF、SGD、NN）分类NEO与非NEO。

Result: 结合digest2过滤与机器学习模型，非NEO误报减少超80%，NEO漏报率仅5.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著优化NEOCP候选筛选，减少资源浪费，提升NEO确认效率。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates
of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between
2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the
inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in
near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the
NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing
time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the
candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are
insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives
and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for
NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30
distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as
NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based
on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs
from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also
investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is,
the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to
classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as
input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in
distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2
parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting
the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most
follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly
identified as NEOs.

*Cheng Ji,Huaiying Luo*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的AI框架，用于云系统的智能故障检测和自愈机制，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云计算的快速发展及其基础设施的复杂性增加，需要实时智能故障检测与自愈机制。传统方法难以应对现代云环境的规模和动态性。

Method: 结合机器学习故障检测算法与LLM的自然语言理解能力，通过语义上下文处理系统日志、错误报告和实时数据流。采用多级架构，结合监督学习（故障分类）和无监督学习（异常检测）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型在故障检测准确性、系统停机时间减少和恢复速度方面显著优于传统系统。

Conclusion: 提出的AI框架为云系统提供了高效的智能故障检测与自愈解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: With the rapid development of cloud computing systems and the increasing
complexity of their infrastructure, intelligent mechanisms to detect and
mitigate failures in real time are becoming increasingly important. Traditional
methods of failure detection are often difficult to cope with the scale and
dynamics of modern cloud environments. In this study, we propose a novel AI
framework based on Massive Language Model (LLM) for intelligent fault detection
and self-healing mechanisms in cloud systems. The model combines existing
machine learning fault detection algorithms with LLM's natural language
understanding capabilities to process and parse system logs, error reports, and
real-time data streams through semantic context. The method adopts a
multi-level architecture, combined with supervised learning for fault
classification and unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, so that the
system can predict potential failures before they occur and automatically
trigger the self-healing mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed
model is significantly better than the traditional fault detection system in
terms of fault detection accuracy, system downtime reduction and recovery
speed.

TL;DR: CU-HLM是一种高效通信和不确定性感知的混合语言模型，通过动态截断词汇分布和跳过低不确定性传输，显著提升吞吐量并减少资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始HLM存在通信开销大和资源浪费问题，需要改进以支持分布式异构计算资源。

Method: CU-HLM仅在SLM输出不确定性高时传输截断词汇分布，并优化不确定性阈值和截断策略。

Result: CU-HLM吞吐量提升206倍，跳过74.8%传输，词汇压缩97.4%，准确率保持97.4%。

Conclusion: CU-HLM在保持高准确率的同时，显著提升了效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and
heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a
promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates
draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model
(LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication
overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary
distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation
resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be
accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and
uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated
vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate
the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong
correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability.
Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal
vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to
standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by
skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while
maintaining 97.4% accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ZenFlow是一种新的卸载框架，通过优先处理重要参数并解耦GPU和CPU的更新，显著提升了训练效率，减少了GPU空闲时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卸载框架（如ZeRO-Offload）对所有参数一视同仁，导致GPU因等待CPU更新而空闲，效率低下。

Method: ZenFlow通过在GPU上原地更新重要梯度，同时异步卸载和累积次要梯度，并利用轻量级梯度选择方法避免全局同步。

Result: ZenFlow实现了5倍端到端加速，PCIe流量减少2倍，GPU空闲时间降低85%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: ZenFlow通过智能参数管理和异步更新策略，显著提升了大型语言模型微调的效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often exceeds GPU memory limits,
prompting systems to offload model states to CPU memory. However, existing
offloaded training frameworks like ZeRO-Offload treat all parameters equally
and update the full model on the CPU, causing severe GPU stalls, where fast,
expensive GPUs sit idle waiting for slow CPU updates and limited-bandwidth PCIe
transfers.
  We present ZenFlow, a new offloading framework that prioritizes important
parameters and decouples updates between GPU and CPU. ZenFlow performs in-place
updates of important gradients on GPU, while asynchronously offloading and
accumulating less important ones on CPU, fully overlapping CPU work with GPU
computation.
  To scale across GPUs, ZenFlow introduces a lightweight gradient selection
method that exploits a novel spatial and temporal locality property of
important gradients, avoiding costly global synchronization. ZenFlow achieves
up to 5x end-to-end speedup, 2x lower PCIe traffic, and reduces GPU stalls by
over 85 percent, all while preserving accuracy.

Motivation: 边缘AI集群中频繁的节点和链路变化会干扰分布式训练，传统的检查点恢复和云中心自动扩展速度慢且不适用于边缘环境。

Method: Chaos采用多邻居复制和快速分片调度加速扩展，通过集群监控跟踪资源变化，并通过对等协商协议实现完全自管理的自动扩展。

Result: 实验显示，Chaos的扩展延迟显著低于其他系统，能在1毫秒内处理节点加入、退出和故障，资源利用率更高。

Conclusion: Chaos在边缘环境中表现出卓越的弹性和可扩展性，适用于动态变化的分布式训练场景。

Abstract: Frequent node and link changes in edge AI clusters disrupt distributed
training, while traditional checkpoint-based recovery and cloud-centric
autoscaling are too slow for scale-out and ill-suited to chaotic and
self-governed edge. This paper proposes Chaos, a resilient and scalable edge
distributed training system with built-in self-healing and autoscaling. It
speeds up scale-out by using multi-neighbor replication with fast shard
scheduling, allowing a new node to pull the latest training state from nearby
neighbors in parallel while balancing the traffic load between them. It also
uses a cluster monitor to track resource and topology changes to assist
scheduler decisions, and handles scaling events through peer negotiation
protocols, enabling fully self-governed autoscaling without a central admin.
Extensive experiments show that Chaos consistently achieves much lower
scale-out delays than Pollux, EDL, and Autoscaling, and handles scale-in,
connect-link, and disconnect-link events within 1 millisecond, making it
smoother to handle node joins, exits, and failures. It also delivers the lowest
idle time, showing superior resource use and scalability as the cluster grows.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems leverage advanced AI models as autonomous agents that
interact, cooperate, or compete to complete complex tasks across applications
such as robotics and traffic management. Despite their growing importance,
safety in multi-agent systems remains largely underexplored, with most research
focusing on single AI models rather than interacting agents. This work
investigates backdoor vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems and proposes a
defense mechanism based on agent interactions. By leveraging reasoning
abilities, each agent evaluates responses from others to detect illogical
reasoning processes, which indicate poisoned agents. Experiments on LLM-based
multi-agent systems, including ChatGPT series and Llama 3, demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving high accuracy in identifying
poisoned agents while minimizing false positives on clean agents. We believe
this work provides insights into multi-agent system safety and contributes to
the development of robust, trustworthy AI interactions.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的多智能体系统（MAS）开发依赖手工方法，缺乏系统性设计和优化的研究。

Method: 提出OMAC框架，包含五个优化维度，并设计两种算法（语义初始化和对比比较器）进行单维度和多维度联合优化。

Result: 实验证明OMAC在代码生成、数学推理和通用推理任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OMAC为LLM-based MAS的系统化优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Agents powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across diverse complex applications. Recently,
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), wherein multiple agents collaborate and communicate
with each other, have exhibited enhanced capabilities in complex tasks, such as
high-quality code generation and arithmetic reasoning. However, the development
of such systems often relies on handcrafted methods, and the literature on
systematic design and optimization of LLM-based MAS remains limited.
  In this work, we introduce OMAC, a general framework designed for holistic
optimization of LLM-based MAS. Specifically, we identify five key optimization
dimensions for MAS, encompassing both agent functionality and collaboration
structure. Building upon these dimensions, we first propose a general
algorithm, utilizing two actors termed the Semantic Initializer and the
Contrastive Comparator, to optimize any single dimension. Then, we present an
algorithm for joint optimization across multiple dimensions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of OMAC on code generation,
arithmetic reasoning, and general reasoning tasks against state-of-the-art
approaches.

Result: 发现集中治理、导师引导参与、有序交互和情境总结能优化任务准确性与资源利用的平衡。

Conclusion: 为设计自适应、可扩展的多智能体系统奠定了基础，强调了策略交互机制的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing
complex, distributed tasks in large language model (LLM)-driven applications.
While prior research has focused on high-level architectural frameworks, the
granular mechanisms governing agents, critical to performance and scalability,
remain underexplored. This study systematically investigates four dimensions of
collaboration strategies: (1) agent governance, (2) participation control, (3)
interaction dynamics, and (4) dialogue history management. Through rigorous
experimentation under two context-dependent scenarios: Distributed Evidence
Integration (DEI) and Structured Evidence Synthesis (SES), we quantify the
impact of these strategies on both task accuracy and computational efficiency.
Our findings reveal that centralized governance, instructor-led participation,
ordered interaction patterns, and instructor-curated context summarization
collectively optimize the trade-off between decision quality and resource
utilization with the support of the proposed Token-Accuracy Ratio (TAR). This
work establishes a foundation for designing adaptive, scalable multi-agent
systems, shifting the focus from structural novelty to strategic interaction
mechanics.

*Keisuke Okumura,Hiroki Nagai*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: PIBT是一种轻量级多智能体路径规划算法，本文研究了两种简单有效的决策技术，以减少冲突并优化路径成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PIBT在贪婪行为下可能因路径选择不唯一导致效率问题，需优化决策以提升性能。

Method: 提出两种技术：智能避让和基于学习的后悔最小化，用于优化PIBT的决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，这些技术能显著降低路径成本（10-20%）并提升吞吐量，且不影响计算速度。

Conclusion: 两种决策技术有效提升了PIBT的性能，适用于大规模多智能体路径规划问题。

Abstract: PIBT is a computationally lightweight algorithm that can be applied to a
variety of multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, generating the next
collision-free locations of agents given another. Because of its simplicity and
scalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale
MAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT
makes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents
typically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not
always unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these
actions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two
simple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising
its computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to
intelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will
hinder the progress of the next timestep. The second technique is to learn,
through multiple PIBT runs, how an action causes regret in others and to use
this information to minimise regret collectively. Our empirical results
demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the solution cost of one-shot MAPF
and improve the throughput of lifelong MAPF. For instance, in densely populated
one-shot cases, the combined use of these tiebreaks achieves improvements of
around 10-20% in sum-of-costs, without significantly compromising the speed of
a PIBT-based planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习（MARL）常面临视野范围困境，即智能体从环境中获取的信息不足或过多。

Method: DSR利用UCB算法动态调整训练中的视野范围，无需依赖全局信息或通信机制。

Result: 实验表明，DSR在多种MARL环境和算法中表现优异，提高了性能并加速了训练过程，同时增加了可解释性。

Conclusion: DSR为视野范围困境提供了实用高效的解决方案，适用于现实复杂环境。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement Learning (MARL) is often challenged by the sight
range dilemma, where agents either receive insufficient or excessive
information from their environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
called Dynamic Sight Range Selection (DSR), to address this issue. DSR utilizes
an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm and dynamically adjusts the sight
range during training. Experiment results show several advantages of using DSR.
First, we demonstrate using DSR achieves better performance in three common
MARL environments, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF), Multi-Robot Warehouse
(RWARE), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). Second, our results show
that DSR consistently improves performance across multiple MARL algorithms,
including QMIX and MAPPO. Third, DSR offers suitable sight ranges for different
training steps, thereby accelerating the training process. Finally, DSR
provides additional interpretability by indicating the optimal sight range used
during training. Unlike existing methods that rely on global information or
communication mechanisms, our approach operates solely based on the individual
sight ranges of agents. This approach offers a practical and efficient solution
to the sight range dilemma, making it broadly applicable to real-world complex
environments.

Conclusion: ASE为复杂软件工程问题提供了结构化解决方案，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: As modern software systems expand in scale and complexity, the challenges
associated with their modeling and formulation grow increasingly intricate.
Traditional approaches often fall short in effectively addressing these
complexities, particularly in tasks such as design pattern detection for
maintenance and assessment, as well as code refactoring for optimization and
long-term sustainability. This growing inadequacy underscores the need for a
paradigm shift in how such challenges are approached and resolved. This paper
presents Analytical Software Engineering (ASE), a novel design paradigm aimed
at balancing abstraction, tool accessibility, compatibility, and scalability.
ASE enables effective modeling and resolution of complex software engineering
problems. The paradigm is evaluated through two frameworks
Behavioral-Structural Sequences (BSS) and Optimized Design Refactoring (ODR),
both developed in accordance with ASE principles. BSS offers a compact,
language-agnostic representation of codebases to facilitate precise design
pattern detection. ODR unifies artifact and solution representations to
optimize code refactoring via heuristic algorithms while eliminating iterative
computational overhead. By providing a structured approach to software design
challenges, ASE lays the groundwork for future research in encoding and
analyzing complex software metrics.

TL;DR: EVALOOP是一个评估大语言模型（LLM）编程鲁棒性的新框架，通过自一致性循环评估模型在代码生成和总结任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注静态基准测试的准确性，忽视了模型在编程任务中的鲁棒性，且对抗攻击方法效果有限且不一致。

Method: EVALOOP通过自反馈循环（如代码生成后总结为新的输入）评估模型鲁棒性，无需外部攻击设置。

Result: 在16个LLM上测试，EVALOOP通常在10次循环内导致pass@1性能下降5.01%-19.31%，且鲁棒性与初始性能不总一致。

Conclusion: EVALOOP提供了一种统一的鲁棒性评估方法，揭示了LLM在编程任务中的潜在弱点。

Abstract: Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations,
however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static
benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during
programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model
robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained.
Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent
results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We
introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness
from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality
inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code
summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM
generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language
specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new
output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats
the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical
strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack
setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming.
We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found
that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1
performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align
with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo,
despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated
lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.

Abstract: Geospatial code generation is emerging as a key direction in the integration
of artificial intelligence and geoscientific analysis. However, there remains a
lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address
this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated
evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth
Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the
GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench)
comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework
integrates both question generation and answer verification components to
enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to
execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative
analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution
efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including
general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized
models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization
pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and
foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code
generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多样性、针对性修复和进化优化相结合，能生成更高效和鲁棒的测试套件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for
automated unit test generation. We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT
that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques
to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially
generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test
suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided
assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic
algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over
traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of
unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects,
EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and
mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based software testing
baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity,
targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and
resilient test suites.

analysis tools, due to the potential for false-positives. In some cases,
warnings may be indicative of larger issues, but programmers may not understand
how a seemingly unimportant warning can grow into a vulnerability. Because
these messages tend to be long and confusing, programmers tend to ignore them
if they do not cause readily identifiable issues. Large language models can
simplify these warnings, explain the gravity of important warnings, and suggest
potential fixes to increase developer compliance with fixing warnings.

### [942] [OSS-Bench: Benchmark Generator for Coding LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12331)
*Yuancheng Jiang,Roland Yap,Zhenkai Liang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: OSS-Bench是一个自动从开源软件生成大规模实时评估任务的基准测试工具，用于评估LLM生成代码的质量，重点关注编译性、功能正确性和内存安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试需要大量手动工作、任务不够挑战性或忽视低层安全评估，因此需要一种更实用和可扩展的评估框架。

Method: 通过替换开源软件中的函数为LLM生成代码，并使用编译失败、测试套件违规和消毒器警报等信号进行评估。

Result: 评估了17种LLM，揭示了模型家族内行为模式和模型大小与性能不一致性，并发现LLM对低层代码安全理解有限。

Conclusion: OSS-Bench提供了一种实用且可扩展的框架，用于评估LLM在真实世界中的编码能力。

Abstract: In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted
development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for
robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require
extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or
insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or
neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety
issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that
automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world
open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and
evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional
correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation
failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our
evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql),
profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral
patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results
demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving
complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code
security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a
practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding
capabilities of LLMs.

*Han Deng,Yuan Meng,Shixiang Tang,Wanli Ouyang,Xinzhu Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出CPRet，一个针对竞争性编程的检索基准套件，解决重复或相似问题对公平性和模型评估有效性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程中重复或高度相似问题的增多影响了竞赛公平性和模型评估的有效性，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出CPRet基准套件，包含四种检索任务，并开发两种专用检索模型（CPRetriever-Code和CPRetriever-Prob）。

Result: 两种模型表现优异，且高相似问题会夸大模型通过率，降低区分度。

Conclusion: 未来基准需考虑相似性评估，CPRet为竞争性编程提供了高质量的数据和模型支持。

Abstract: Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as
programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing
presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about
competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as
a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem --
similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both
data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce
CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming,
covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and
Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e.,
Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of
automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations.
Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally
separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two
task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained
with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and
CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both
models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we
analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass
rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware
evaluation in future benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有代码补全评估指标与用户实际感知存在差距，且LLMs在仓库级代码补全中缺乏有效的结构语义建模和跨模块依赖信息。

Method: 提出LCP和ROUGE-LCP评估指标，以及基于SPSR-Graph的数据处理方法。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，新评估指标更符合用户感知，数据处理方法能有效提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 新指标和方法在代码补全任务中具有优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Code completion technology based on large language model has significantly
improved the development efficiency of programmers. However, in practical
applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion
evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we
propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP,
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency
information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose
a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and
Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis
and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the
effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.

*Kyla Guru,Robert J. Moss,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）在基于行为指标的网络安全攻击归因中的应用，发现LLM生成的TTP数据存在噪声，但仍可用于训练高于基线的归因模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从密集的取证文档中手动提取行为指标导致归因延迟，尤其是在国际范围内重大事件后，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 测试了OpenAI的GPT-4和text-embedding-3-large，通过向量嵌入搜索从文本中识别TTP，并构建配置文件用于机器学习模型训练。

Result: LLM生成的TTP数据集与人工生成的数据集相似度低，但频率相似，且仍能训练出优于基线的归因模型。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM生成的TTP存在噪声，但其在自动化攻击归因中仍具有实用价值。

Abstract: Attribution of cyber-attacks remains a complex but critical challenge for
cyber defenders. Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from
dense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially
following major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates
large language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral
indicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and
text-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data
from MITRE ATT&CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using
vector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a
machine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing
off-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an
end-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction. This
research finds that standard LLMs generate TTP datasets with noise, resulting
in a low similarity to human-generated datasets. However, the TTPs generated
are similar in frequency to those within the existing MITRE datasets.
Additionally, although these TTPs are different than human-generated datasets,
our work demonstrates that they still prove useful for training a model that
performs above baseline on attribution. Project code and files are contained

TL;DR: AuthChain是一种新型知识投毒攻击方法，通过证据链理论和权威效应生成更具说服力的投毒文档，显著提高攻击成功率并保持隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG增强的LLMs在生成准确响应方面表现优异，但其依赖外部知识库可能引入安全漏洞，尤其是当知识库公开可修改时。现有投毒攻击方法因需注入多个恶意文档而易被检测且不实用。

Method: AuthChain利用证据链理论和权威效应，生成具有强证据链和权威声明的投毒内容，以克服真实文档和LLMs内部知识的干扰。

Result: 在六种流行LLMs上的实验表明，AuthChain的攻击成功率显著高于现有基线，同时对RAG防御机制保持高度隐蔽性。

Conclusion: AuthChain为单文档投毒攻击提供了有效解决方案，展示了其在安全漏洞利用中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses.
However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential
security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly
accessible and modifiable. Poisoning attacks on knowledge bases for RAG systems
face two fundamental challenges: the injected malicious content must compete
with multiple authentic documents retrieved by the retriever, and LLMs tend to
trust retrieved information that aligns with their internal memorized
knowledge. Previous works attempt to address these challenges by injecting
multiple malicious documents, but such saturation attacks are easily detectable
and impractical in real-world scenarios. To enable the effective single
document poisoning attack, we propose AuthChain, a novel knowledge poisoning
attack method that leverages Chain-of-Evidence theory and authority effect to
craft more convincing poisoned documents. AuthChain generates poisoned content
that establishes strong evidence chains and incorporates authoritative
statements, effectively overcoming the interference from both authentic
documents and LLMs' internal knowledge. Extensive experiments across six
popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack
success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense
mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: AC-LoRA是一种端到端系统，用于访问控制感知的企业LLM聊天机器人，通过分离的LoRA适配器和文档嵌入实现强信息隔离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM易泄露敏感信息，难以在需要严格访问控制的环境中应用。

Method: 设计AC-LoRA系统，基于用户查询和权限检索LoRA适配器，合并响应无需额外训练。

Result: AC-LoRA在性能上匹配或超越现有LoRA混合技术，同时提供强隔离保证。

Conclusion: AC-LoRA设计可扩展到不同模态，适用于企业环境。

Abstract: Corporate LLMs are gaining traction for efficient knowledge dissemination and
management within organizations. However, as current LLMs are vulnerable to
leaking sensitive information, it has proven difficult to apply them in
settings where strict access control is necessary. To this end, we design
AC-LoRA, an end-to-end system for access control-aware corporate LLM chatbots
that maintains a strong information isolation guarantee. AC-LoRA maintains
separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document
embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA
adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their
permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more
than one LoRA is retrieved, without requiring any additional training for LoRA
routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two
datasets, and show that AC-LoRA matches or even exceeds the performance of
state-of-the-art LoRA mixing techniques while providing strong isolation
guarantees. Furthermore, we show that AC-LoRA design can be directly applied to
different modalities.

Abstract: While Large Language Models have shown promise in cybersecurity applications,
their effectiveness in identifying security threats within cloud deployments
remains unexplored. This paper introduces AWS Cloud Security Engineering Eval,
a novel dataset for evaluating LLMs cloud security threat modeling
capabilities. ACSE-Eval contains 100 production grade AWS deployment scenarios,
each featuring detailed architectural specifications, Infrastructure as Code
implementations, documented security vulnerabilities, and associated threat
modeling parameters. Our dataset enables systemic assessment of LLMs abilities
to identify security risks, analyze attack vectors, and propose mitigation
strategies in cloud environments. Our evaluations on ACSE-Eval demonstrate that
GPT 4.1 and Gemini 2.5 Pro excel at threat identification, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing optimally in 0-shot scenarios and GPT 4.1 showing superior results
in few-shot settings. While GPT 4.1 maintains a slight overall performance
advantage, Claude 3.7 Sonnet generates the most semantically sophisticated
threat models but struggles with threat categorization and generalization. To
promote reproducibility and advance research in automated cybersecurity threat
analysis, we open-source our dataset, evaluation metrics, and methodologies.

Result: 实验表明后门复杂性问题普遍存在，提出的方法能有效减少问题且保持攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该研究为后门攻击的隐蔽性和有效性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research highlights concerns about the trustworthiness of third-party
Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) due to potential backdoor attacks. These
backdoored PTLMs, however, are effective only for specific pre-defined
downstream tasks. In reality, these PTLMs can be adapted to many other
unrelated downstream tasks. Such adaptation may lead to unforeseen consequences
in downstream model outputs, consequently raising user suspicion and
compromising attack stealthiness. We refer to this phenomenon as backdoor
complications. In this paper, we undertake the first comprehensive
quantification of backdoor complications. Through extensive experiments using 4
prominent PTLMs and 16 text classification benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
the widespread presence of backdoor complications in downstream models
fine-tuned from backdoored PTLMs. The output distribution of triggered samples
significantly deviates from that of clean samples. Consequently, we propose a
backdoor complication reduction method leveraging multi-task learning to
mitigate complications without prior knowledge of downstream tasks. The
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively
reduce complications while maintaining the efficacy and consistency of backdoor
attacks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: MARVEL是一个多代理LLM框架，用于硬件安全验证，通过模拟设计师的认知过程，结合多种工具和技术，显著提高了漏洞检测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件安全验证是一项复杂且耗时的任务，现有工具和技术需要进一步整合和优化以提高效率和准确性。

Method: 提出MARVEL框架，包括一个监督代理和多个执行代理，监督代理制定安全策略，执行代理使用多种工具（如形式验证、静态分析等）检测漏洞。

Result: 在OpenTitan的已知漏洞SoC上测试，MARVEL报告的48个问题中有20个是实际安全漏洞。

Conclusion: MARVEL通过多代理协作和工具整合，显著提升了硬件安全验证的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Hardware security verification is a challenging and time-consuming task. For
this purpose, design engineers may utilize tools such as formal verification,
linters, and functional simulation tests, coupled with analysis and a deep
understanding of the hardware design being inspected. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been used to assist during this task, either directly or in
conjunction with existing tools. We improve the state of the art by proposing
MARVEL, a multi-agent LLM framework for a unified approach to decision-making,
tool use, and reasoning. MARVEL mimics the cognitive process of a designer
looking for security vulnerabilities in RTL code. It consists of a supervisor
agent that devises the security policy of the system-on-chips (SoCs) using its
security documentation. It delegates tasks to validate the security policy to
individual executor agents. Each executor agent carries out its assigned task
using a particular strategy. Each executor agent may use one or more tools to
identify potential security bugs in the design and send the results back to the
supervisor agent for further analysis and confirmation. MARVEL includes
executor agents that leverage formal tools, linters, simulation tests,
LLM-based detection schemes, and static analysis-based checks. We test our
approach on a known buggy SoC based on OpenTitan from the Hack@DATE
competition. We find that 20 of the 48 issues reported by MARVEL pose security
vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的复杂性和协作性增加，其知识产权保护问题日益突出。

Method: MASLEAK通过精心设计的对抗性查询，在无需了解MAS内部结构的情况下，通过公共API提取信息。

Result: 攻击成功率为87%（系统提示和任务指令）和92%（系统架构）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MAS的知识产权风险，并提出了潜在防御措施。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the
emergence of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to perform complex tasks through
collaboration. However, the intricate nature of MAS, including their
architecture and agent interactions, raises significant concerns regarding
intellectual property (IP) protection. In this paper, we introduce MASLEAK, a
novel attack framework designed to extract sensitive information from MAS
applications. MASLEAK targets a practical, black-box setting, where the
adversary has no prior knowledge of the MAS architecture or agent
configurations. The adversary can only interact with the MAS through its public
API, submitting attack query $q$ and observing outputs from the final agent.
Inspired by how computer worms propagate and infect vulnerable network hosts,
MASLEAK carefully crafts adversarial query $q$ to elicit, propagate, and retain
responses from each MAS agent that reveal a full set of proprietary components,
including the number of agents, system topology, system prompts, task
instructions, and tool usages. We construct the first synthetic dataset of MAS
applications with 810 applications and also evaluate MASLEAK against real-world
MAS applications, including Coze and CrewAI. MASLEAK achieves high accuracy in
extracting MAS IP, with an average attack success rate of 87% for system
prompts and task instructions, and 92% for system architecture in most cases.
We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and the potential
defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在关键系统中的广泛应用带来了安全风险，但现有安全工具缺乏正式评估。

Method: 构建恶意提示基准数据集，比较7种工具与基线模型的性能。

Result: 基线模型误报率高，Lakera Guard和ProtectAI LLM Guard在性能和可用性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建议提高闭源工具透明度、改进检测能力、增强开源参与、提升用户意识，并采用更具代表性的性能指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical
systems in industries like healthcare and finance. Users can often submit
queries to LLM-enabled chatbots, some of which can enrich responses with
information retrieved from internal databases storing sensitive data. This
gives rise to a range of attacks in which a user submits a malicious query and
the LLM-system outputs a response that creates harm to the owner, such as
leaking internal data or creating legal liability by harming a third-party.
While security tools are being developed to counter these threats, there is
little formal evaluation of their effectiveness and usability. This study
addresses this gap by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of LLM
security tools. We identified 13 solutions (9 closed-source, 4 open-source),
but only 7 were evaluated due to a lack of participation by proprietary model
owners.To evaluate, we built a benchmark dataset of malicious prompts, and
evaluate these tools performance against a baseline LLM model
(ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo). Our results show that the baseline model has too many
false positives to be used for this task. Lakera Guard and ProtectAI LLM Guard
emerged as the best overall tools showcasing the tradeoff between usability and
performance. The study concluded with recommendations for greater transparency
among closed source providers, improved context-aware detections, enhanced
open-source engagement, increased user awareness, and the adoption of more
representative performance metrics.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoLO是一个统一框架，通过链式水印同时实现训练验证（PoL）和所有权证明（PoO），提高效率并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型共享和外包增加，需同时验证训练努力和所有权，现有方法分开处理导致保护不足和验证成本高。

Method: PoLO将训练过程分为细粒度训练块，每个块嵌入基于前一块哈希的专用水印，形成链式结构。

Result: PoLO实现99%水印检测准确率，验证成本降至传统方法的1.5-10%，伪造成本提高1.1-4倍。

Conclusion: PoLO高效、隐私友好且安全，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly shared and outsourced, raising
requirements of verifying training effort (Proof-of-Learning, PoL) to ensure
claimed performance and establishing ownership (Proof-of-Ownership, PoO) for
transactions. When models are trained by untrusted parties, PoL and PoO must be
enforced together to enable protection, attribution, and compensation. However,
existing studies typically address them separately, which not only weakens
protection against forgery and privacy breaches but also leads to high
verification overhead.
  We propose PoLO, a unified framework that simultaneously achieves PoL and PoO
using chained watermarks. PoLO splits the training process into fine-grained
training shards and embeds a dedicated watermark in each shard. Each watermark
is generated using the hash of the preceding shard, certifying the training
process of the preceding shard. The chained structure makes it computationally
difficult to forge any individual part of the whole training process. The
complete set of watermarks serves as the PoL, while the final watermark
provides the PoO. PoLO offers more efficient and privacy-preserving
verification compared to the vanilla PoL solutions that rely on gradient-based
trajectory tracing and inadvertently expose training data during verification,
while maintaining the same level of ownership assurance of watermark-based PoO
schemes. Our evaluation shows that PoLO achieves 99% watermark detection
accuracy for ownership verification, while preserving data privacy and cutting
verification costs to just 1.5-10% of traditional methods. Forging PoLO demands
1.1-4x more resources than honest proof generation, with the original proof
retaining over 90% detection accuracy even after attacks.

Result: 实验证明该框架能有效检测真实和合成异常，并提供可解释结果，帮助重建异常来源。

Conclusion: 该框架可无缝集成到企业环境中，补充现有安全系统，实现可解释的威胁检测。

Abstract: User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data
analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to
detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep
Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA
tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to
the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive
business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of
an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep
Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual
features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural
networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely
used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results
demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic
anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models
provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable
results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly.
Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly
integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security
systems for explainable threat detection.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) enhance mobility but face
cybersecurity threats, particularly through the insecure Controller Area
Network (CAN) bus. Cyberattacks can have devastating consequences in connected
vehicles, including the loss of control over critical systems, necessitating
robust security solutions. In-vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) offer
a promising approach by detecting malicious activities in real time. This
survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research on
learning-based in-vehicle IDSs, focusing on Machine Learning (ML), Deep

studies, we critically examine existing IDS approaches, categorising them by
the types of attacks they detect - known, unknown, and combined known-unknown
attacks - while identifying their limitations. We also review the evaluation

meet the requirements of safety-critical systems. Additionally, we analyse

Motivation: 强化学习代理在模拟网络攻击时决策不透明，影响信任和防御准备，需解释性框架以理解攻击策略的形成和演变。

Conclusion: 该框架将黑盒学习转化为可操作的行为情报，帮助防御者和开发者更好地应对网络威胁。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly used to simulate
sophisticated cyberattacks, but their decision-making processes remain opaque,
hindering trust, debugging, and defensive preparedness. In high-stakes
cybersecurity contexts, explainability is essential for understanding how
adversarial strategies are formed and evolve over time. In this paper, we
propose a unified, multi-layer explainability framework for RL-based attacker
agents that reveals both strategic (MDP-level) and tactical (policy-level)
reasoning. At the MDP level, we model cyberattacks as a Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to expose exploration-exploitation dynamics
and phase-aware behavioural shifts. At the policy level, we analyse the
temporal evolution of Q-values and use Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) to
surface critical learning transitions and evolving action preferences.
Evaluated across CyberBattleSim environments of increasing complexity, our
framework offers interpretable insights into agent behaviour at scale. Unlike
previous explainable RL methods, which are often post-hoc, domain-specific, or
limited in depth, our approach is both agent- and environment-agnostic,
supporting use cases ranging from red-team simulation to RL policy debugging.
By transforming black-box learning into actionable behavioural intelligence,
our framework enables both defenders and developers to better anticipate,
analyse, and respond to autonomous cyber threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have been widely deployed
in a wide range of applications in the real world, including healthcare
diagnostics, financial analysis, customer support, robotics, and autonomous
driving, expanding their powerful capability of understanding, reasoning, and
generating natural languages. However, the wide deployment of LLM-based
applications exposes critical security and reliability risks, such as the
potential for malicious misuse, privacy leakage, and service disruption that
weaken user trust and undermine societal safety. This paper provides a
systematic overview of the details of adversarial attacks targeting both LLMs
and LLM-based agents. These attacks are organized into three phases in LLMs:
Training-Phase Attacks, Inference-Phase Attacks, and Availability & Integrity
Attacks. For each phase, we analyze the details of representative and recently
introduced attack methods along with their corresponding defenses. We hope our
survey will provide a good tutorial and a comprehensive understanding of LLM
security, especially for attacks on LLMs. We desire to raise attention to the
risks inherent in widely deployed LLM-based applications and highlight the
urgent need for robust mitigation strategies for evolving threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，原创内容创作者的权益受到威胁，用户减少对原始内容的直接访问，导致网络空间充斥更多AI生成内容。

Method: 提出一种基于LLMs语义理解能力的防御框架，解决黑盒优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将防御成功率从2.5%提升至88.6%，优于传统配置限制方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护了网络知识产权，为内容创作者提供了新的防御手段。

Abstract: Protecting cyber Intellectual Property (IP) such as web content is an
increasingly critical concern. The rise of large language models (LLMs) with
online retrieval capabilities presents a double-edged sword that enables
convenient access to information but often undermines the rights of original
content creators. As users increasingly rely on LLM-generated responses, they
gradually diminish direct engagement with original information sources,
significantly reducing the incentives for IP creators to contribute, and
leading to a saturating cyberspace with more AI-generated content. In response,
we propose a novel defense framework that empowers web content creators to
safeguard their web-based IP from unauthorized LLM real-time extraction by
leveraging the semantic understanding capability of LLMs themselves. Our method
follows principled motivations and effectively addresses an intractable
black-box optimization problem. Real-world experiments demonstrated that our
methods improve defense success rates from 2.5% to 88.6% on different LLMs,
outperforming traditional defenses such as configuration-based restrictions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FL-PLAS是一种新的联邦学习防御算法，通过部分层聚合策略有效抵御后门攻击，无需服务器辅助数据集，在90%恶意用户情况下仍保持高主任务准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的后门攻击日益隐蔽且难以检测，现有防御方法无法应对高比例恶意用户或依赖辅助数据集。

Method: 将本地模型分为特征提取器和分类器，仅上传特征提取器参数进行聚合，保留分类器层以避免后门标签影响。

Result: 在三种图像数据集上，FL-PLAS能有效抵御SOTA后门攻击，主任务准确率高且后门准确率低。

Conclusion: FL-PLAS是一种高效且无需额外数据的防御方法，适用于高比例恶意用户的场景。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is gaining increasing attention as an emerging
collaborative machine learning approach, particularly in the context of
large-scale computing and data systems. However, the fundamental algorithm of
FL, Federated Averaging (FedAvg), is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Although
researchers have proposed numerous defense algorithms, two significant
challenges remain. The attack is becoming more stealthy and harder to detect,
and current defense methods are unable to handle 50\% or more malicious users
or assume an auxiliary server dataset.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense algorithm, FL-PLAS,
\textbf{F}ederated \textbf{L}earning based on \textbf{P}artial\textbf{ L}ayer
\textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{S}trategy. In particular, we divide the local
model into a feature extractor and a classifier. In each iteration, the clients
only upload the parameters of a feature extractor after local training. The
server then aggregates these local parameters and returns the results to the
clients.
  Each client retains its own classifier layer, ensuring that the backdoor
labels do not impact other clients. We assess the effectiveness of FL-PLAS
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on three image datasets and
compare our approach to six defense strategies. The results of the experiment
demonstrate that our methods can effectively protect local models from backdoor
attacks. Without requiring any auxiliary dataset for the server, our method
achieves a high main-task accuracy with a lower backdoor accuracy even under
the condition of 90\% malicious users with the attacks of trigger, semantic and
edge-case.

Motivation: 现有矩阵分解方法在多轮训练中的理论误差界限存在显著差距，需要一种更优的分解方法。

Method: 引入Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR)方法，通过带状逆相关矩阵结构实现显式分解。

Result: BISR在多轮误差上实现了显式且紧致的刻画，并证明其渐近最优性。

Conclusion: BISR在性能上与现有最优方法相当，但更简单、高效且易于分析。

Abstract: Matrix factorization mechanisms for differentially private training have
emerged as a promising approach to improve model utility under privacy
constraints. In practical settings, models are typically trained over multiple
epochs, requiring matrix factorizations that account for repeated
participation. Existing theoretical upper and lower bounds on multi-epoch
factorization error leave a significant gap. In this work, we introduce a new
explicit factorization method, Banded Inverse Square Root (BISR), which imposes
a banded structure on the inverse correlation matrix. This factorization
enables us to derive an explicit and tight characterization of the multi-epoch
error. We further prove that BISR achieves asymptotically optimal error by
matching the upper and lower bounds. Empirically, BISR performs on par with
state-of-the-art factorization methods, while being simpler to implement,
computationally efficient, and easier to analyze.

Conclusion: 该方法为恶意软件分类提供了有效解决方案，尤其适用于动态变化的威胁环境。

Abstract: Malware are malicious programs that are grouped into families based on their
penetration technique, source code, and other characteristics. Classifying
malware programs into their respective families is essential for building
effective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge
potential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be
recognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest
files. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the
high-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of
training samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families
makes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the
malware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that,
on top of classifying known malware, detects new ones. In particular, we
combine an open-set recognition technique developed within the computer vision
community, namely MaxLogit, with a tree-based Gradient Boosting classifier,
which is particularly effective in classifying high-dimensional data. Our
solution turns out to be very practical, as it can be seamlessly employed in a
standard classification workflow, and efficient, as it adds minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on public and proprietary datasets
demonstrate the potential of our solution, which has been deployed in a
business environment.

Motivation: 现有方法在高恶意客户端比例和非独立同分布数据下表现不佳，导致准确性下降。

Method: FLTG结合ReLU截断余弦相似度过滤客户端，动态选择参考客户端，并基于角度偏差分配权重。

Result: 在多种攻击下，FLTG在极端偏差和高恶意客户端比例（超过50%）下表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FLTG显著提升了联邦学习在对抗攻击和非独立同分布数据下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Byzantine attacks during model aggregation in Federated Learning (FL)
threaten training integrity by manipulating malicious clients' updates.
Existing methods struggle with limited robustness under high malicious client
ratios and sensitivity to non-i.i.d. data, leading to degraded accuracy. To
address this, we propose FLTG, a novel aggregation algorithm integrating
angle-based defense and dynamic reference selection. FLTG first filters clients
via ReLU-clipped cosine similarity, leveraging a server-side clean dataset to
exclude misaligned updates. It then dynamically selects a reference client
based on the prior global model to mitigate non-i.i.d. bias, assigns
aggregation weights inversely proportional to angular deviations, and
normalizes update magnitudes to suppress malicious scaling. Evaluations across
datasets of varying complexity under five classic attacks demonstrate FLTG's
superiority over state-of-the-art methods under extreme bias scenarios and
sustains robustness with a higher proportion(over 50%) of malicious clients.

Motivation: 在大规模数据训练中，特征选择能提升性能，但现有隐私保护算法需多方参与且无法保证完全安全。

Method: 提出首个基于全同态加密的外包特征选择算法，优化了时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 将复杂度从O(kn^2)降至O(kn log^3 n)和O(kn)，实验验证了其高效性。

Conclusion: 该算法在隐私保护和计算效率上均优于现有方法，适用于小数据集。

Abstract: Feature selection is a technique that extracts a meaningful subset from a set
of features in training data. When the training data is large-scale,
appropriate feature selection enables the removal of redundant features, which
can improve generalization performance, accelerate the training process, and
enhance the interpretability of the model. This study proposes a
privacy-preserving computation model for feature selection. Generally, when the
data owner and analyst are the same, there is no need to conceal the private
information. However, when they are different parties or when multiple owners
exist, an appropriate privacy-preserving framework is required. Although
various private feature selection algorithms, they all require two or more
computing parties and do not guarantee security in environments where no
external party can be fully trusted. To address this issue, we propose the
first outsourcing algorithm for feature selection using fully homomorphic
encryption. Compared to a prior two-party algorithm, our result improves the
time and space complexity O(kn^2) to O(kn log^3 n) and O(kn), where k and n
denote the number of features and data samples, respectively. We also
implemented the proposed algorithm and conducted comparative experiments with
the naive one. The experimental result shows the efficiency of our method even
with small datasets.

Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new
paradigm in mobile computing--LLM-powered mobile AI agents--capable of
decomposing and automating complex tasks directly on smartphones. However, the
security implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper,
we present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents,
encompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed
by original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party
Universal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g.,
Alibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile
agents and identifying security threats across three core capability
dimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level
execution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the
unique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning
their entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice,
we introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that
systematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios.
Applying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning
trend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases,
agents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These
attacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full
execution hijacking. Based on these findings, we propose a set of defensive
design principles and practical recommendations for building secure mobile LLM
agents. Our disclosures have received positive feedback from two major device
vendors. Overall, this work highlights the urgent need for standardized
security practices in the fast-evolving landscape of LLM-driven mobile
automation.

Abstract: Autonomous browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used to automate web-based tasks. However, their reliance on
dynamic content, tool execution, and user-provided data exposes them to a broad
attack surface. This paper presents a comprehensive security evaluation of such
agents, focusing on systemic vulnerabilities across multiple architectural
layers. Our work outlines the first end-to-end threat model for browsing agents
and provides actionable guidance for securing their deployment in real-world
environments. To address discovered threats, we propose a defense in depth
strategy incorporating input sanitization, planner executor isolation, formal
analyzers, and session safeguards. These measures protect against both initial
access and post exploitation attack vectors. Through a white box analysis of a
popular open source project, Browser Use, we demonstrate how untrusted web
content can hijack agent behavior and lead to critical security breaches. Our
findings include prompt injection, domain validation bypass, and credential
exfiltration, evidenced by a disclosed CVE and a working proof of concept
exploit.

Abstract: In the age of cloud computing, data privacy protection has become a major
challenge, especially when sharing sensitive data across cloud environments.
However, how to optimize collaboration across cloud environments remains an
unresolved problem. In this paper, we combine federated learning with
large-scale language models to optimize the collaborative mechanism of AI
systems. Based on the existing federated learning framework, we introduce a
cross-cloud architecture in which federated learning works by aggregating model
updates from decentralized nodes without exposing the original data. At the
same time, combined with large-scale language models, its powerful context and
semantic understanding capabilities are used to improve model training
efficiency and decision-making ability. We've further innovated by introducing
a secure communication layer to ensure the privacy and integrity of model
updates and training data. The model enables continuous model adaptation and
fine-tuning across different cloud environments while protecting sensitive
data. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly
better than the traditional federated learning model in terms of accuracy,
convergence speed and data privacy protection.

Abstract: The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces
describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an
essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of
thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition
state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations,
the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a
primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian
process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method
where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A
surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic
structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular
reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic
structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is
obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range
in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried
out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of
electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method
implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the
GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle
point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations
are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.

Conclusion: 可编程超表面技术是实现可扩展光子AI加速器的关键硬件，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs), which share the inherent benefits of
photonic systems, such as high parallelism and low power consumption, could
challenge traditional digital neural networks in terms of energy efficiency,
latency, and throughput. However, producing scalable photonic artificial
intelligence (AI) solutions remains challenging. To make photonic AI models
viable, the scalability problem needs to be solved. Large optical AI models
implemented on PNNs are only commercially feasible if the advantages of optical
computation outweigh the cost of their input-output overhead. In this
Perspective, we discuss how field-programmable metasurface technology may
become a key hardware ingredient in achieving scalable photonic AI accelerators
and how it can compete with current digital electronic technologies.
Programmability or reconfigurability is a pivotal component for PNN hardware,
enabling in situ training and accommodating non-stationary use cases that
require fine-tuning or transfer learning. Co-integration with electronics, 3D
stacking, and large-scale manufacturing of metasurfaces would significantly
improve PNN scalability and functionalities. Programmable metasurfaces could
address some of the current challenges that PNNs face and enable
next-generation photonic AI technology.
