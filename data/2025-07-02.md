### [1] [Table Understanding and (Multimodal) LLMs: A Cross-Domain Case Study on Scientific vs. Non-Scientific Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00152)
*Ekaterina Borisova,Fabio Barth,Nils Feldhus,Raia Abu Ahmad,Malte Ostendorff,Pedro Ortiz Suarez,Georg Rehm,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本和多模态LLM在表格理解任务中的表现，发现LLM在科学表格处理中存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格是结构化数据的重要工具，但LLM在表格数据处理中的效率尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过跨领域和跨模态评估，比较LLM在科学与非科学表格中的表现，并分析其鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: LLM在不同表格模态中表现稳健，但在科学表格处理中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在表格理解任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化科学表格处理能力。

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

### [2] [Prompting as Scientific Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00163)
*Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提示（prompting）是研究和控制大型语言模型的主要方法，也是解锁其能力的关键。作者认为应将提示视为行为科学而非权宜之计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示在大型语言模型研究中的科学地位，反驳将其视为“炼金术”的观点。

Method: 通过将大型语言模型视为训练而非编程的复杂生物体，将提示类比为行为科学。

Result: 提示是语言模型原生接口（语言）的探索工具，与机制解释性研究同等重要。

Conclusion: 提示是大型语言模型科学的关键组成部分，不应被低估。

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

### [3] [LineRetriever: Planning-Aware Observation Reduction for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00210)
*Imene Kerboua,Sahar Omidi Shayegan,Megh Thakkar,Xing Han Lù,Massimo Caccia,Véronique Eglin,Alexandre Aussem,Jérémy Espinas,Alexandre Lacoste*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LineRetriever的新方法，用于优化网页导航任务中的检索方法，以解决大语言模型在处理网页内容时的上下文限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理网页内容（如DOM或AxTree结构）时，由于上下文限制，容易丢失关键信息，影响网页代理的自适应规划能力。

Method: LineRetriever利用语言模型识别并检索与未来导航步骤最相关的观察行，而不仅仅是基于语义相似性。

Result: 实验表明，LineRetriever能在减少观察内容的同时，保持导航性能。

Conclusion: LineRetriever为网页导航任务中的自适应规划提供了一种有效的检索优化方法。

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

### [4] [Two-Stage Reasoning-Infused Learning: Improving Classification with LLM-Generated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00214)
*Mads Henrichsen,Rasmus Krebs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，通过利用LLM生成的推理增强文本分类，显著提升了情感分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类模型直接映射输入到标签，缺乏显式推理，可能限制性能、鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 微调Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct模型生成推理文本；2. 用生成的推理增强下游生成模型的训练数据。

Result: 生成模型在情感分类任务中比基线模型准确率提高了8.7个百分点。

Conclusion: LLM生成的推理能丰富训练数据，提升下游任务性能并提供显式解释。

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

### [5] [Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00216)
*Shreya Havaldar,Adam Stein,Eric Wong,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM在翻译风格时的失败，并提出RASTA方法以改善文化差异导致的风格对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化差异常导致说话者意图与听者理解之间的风格不匹配，例如礼貌在翻译中丢失。

Method: 提出RASTA（检索增强风格对齐）方法，利用学习到的风格概念改进LLM翻译，以传达文化沟通规范。

Result: LLM在非西方语言中表现较差，且翻译偏向中性。RASTA能有效改善风格对齐。

Conclusion: RASTA方法通过检索增强技术，显著提升了LLM在跨文化风格翻译中的表现。

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

### [6] [Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00239)
*Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使经过指令调优的语言模型，其隐藏状态中仍可线性解码出被拒绝的有害信息，表明这些信息并未被完全消除或重定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令调优的语言模型是否真正消除了有害信息，还是仅抑制了其直接表达。

Method: 通过线性探针训练模型隐藏状态，分析被拒绝信息的可解码性，并比较基础模型与指令调优模型的差异。

Result: 线性探针能高精度预测被拒绝信息（如国家平均IQ），且基础模型的探针可迁移至指令调优模型，表明信息在内部表征中持续存在。

Conclusion: 指令调优并未完全消除有害信息，而是抑制其直接表达，这些信息仍线性可解码并间接影响下游行为。

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

### [7] [The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00244)
*Isabella Senturia,Matilde Marcolli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数学模型的形态学-句法接口，利用代数操作和形态学树结构描述形态句法树的形成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过数学方法（如合并和强极简论）形式化形态学与句法的接口问题，解决形态学中无移动的特性及其与句法的交互。

Method: 采用代数操作（如余积分解和操作代数）扩展形态学树集合，并通过操作对应关系描述形态句法树的形成。

Result: 模型成功描述了形态学与句法的交互，重新解释了分布式形态学中的操作，提供了形态句法边界灵活调整的数学基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为形态学-句法接口提供了严格的数学框架，支持形态句法对象的灵活构建。

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

### [8] [EfficientXLang: Towards Improving Token Efficiency Through Cross-Lingual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00246)
*Sanchit Ahuja,Praneetha Vaddamanu,Barun Patra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，非英语语言在推理任务中不仅减少token使用，还能保持准确性，且效果优于英语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索英语是否是最高效的推理语言，并评估多语言模型在非英语语言中的表现。

Method: 评估三种开源RLM（DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, Qwen 3）在四个数学数据集和七种语言中的表现。

Result: 非英语语言推理减少token使用且保持准确性，效果优于英语，且多语言能力强的模型表现更佳。

Conclusion: 研究提倡多语言推理的潜力，并强调强大多语言基础的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

### [9] [Impact of Fine-Tuning Methods on Memorization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00258)
*Jie Hou,Chuxiong Wu,Lannan Luo,Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了预训练大语言模型（LLMs）微调中的隐私风险，发现基于提示的微调比基于参数的微调更隐私安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是关注微调过程中因记忆化导致的隐私风险，填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 通过分类流行的微调方法，并利用成员推理攻击（MIAs）评估其对记忆化的影响。

Result: 结果显示，基于提示的微调在性能相当的情况下，对MIAs的脆弱性更低，且不受模型规模影响。

Conclusion: 结论表明基于参数的微调更容易泄露隐私信息，而基于提示的微调是更隐私安全的选择。

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

### [10] [Natural language processing for African languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00297)
*David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了低资源语言（尤其是撒哈拉以南非洲语言）在NLP中的挑战，提出通过高质量语料库和多语言预训练模型提升语义表示和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言在NLP中数据稀缺、噪声多和评估困难的问题，尤其是非洲语言的代表性不足。

Method: 分析公开语料库噪声，构建高质量语料库；研究多语言预训练模型在低资源语言中的适应性和优化方法。

Result: 证实数据质量对词嵌入学习的重要性，多语言预训练模型在低资源语言中表现优越，并创建了21种非洲语言的标注数据集。

Conclusion: 高质量数据和多语言预训练模型能有效提升低资源语言的NLP性能，填补了非洲语言研究的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

### [11] [Failure by Interference: Language Models Make Balanced Parentheses Errors When Faulty Mechanisms Overshadow Sound Ones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00322)
*Daking Rai,Samuel Miller,Kevin Moran,Ziyu Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在生成平衡括号等简单语法任务上表现不佳，原因是模型依赖的某些组件（如注意力头和FF神经元）会引入噪声。作者提出RASteer方法，通过增强可靠组件的作用显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在简单语法任务上表现不佳的原因，并找到改进方法。

Method: 分析模型组件的作用，提出RASteer方法，通过增强可靠组件的作用优化模型。

Result: RASteer显著提升平衡括号任务的准确性（从0%到100%），并在算术推理任务中取得约20%的性能提升。

Conclusion: RASteer是一种有效的方法，通过优化模型组件的作用提升性能，且不影响模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

### [12] [Modeling Data Diversity for Joint Instance and Verbalizer Selection in Cold-Start Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00330)
*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT是一种联合选择verbalizer和实例的方法，通过建模数据多样性，优化不确定性和多样性，在冷启动场景中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法对模板、verbalizer和少样本实例选择敏感，尤其在无标签数据的冷启动场景中。现有研究忽略了实例与verbalizer之间的依赖关系。

Method: COLDSELECT将PLM词汇和$h_{[MASK]}$嵌入映射到共享空间，应用降维和聚类以实现高效多样的选择。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COLDSELECT在减少不确定性和增强泛化能力方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: COLDSELECT通过联合优化verbalizer和实例选择，有效解决了冷启动场景中的挑战。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

### [13] [Question Decomposition for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00355)
*Paul J. L. Ammann,Jonas Golde,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合问题分解的RAG流程，通过将多跳问题分解为子问题并重新排序检索结果，显著提升了检索和答案生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG在处理多跳问题时表现不佳，因为相关信息分散在多个文档中。

Method: 提出了一种RAG流程，包括问题分解、子问题检索和结果重新排序。

Result: 在MultiHop-RAG和HotpotQA上，检索性能（MRR@10）提升了36.7%，答案准确率（F1）提升了11.6%。

Conclusion: 问题分解与重新排序结合是一种无需额外训练的有效改进方法。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

### [14] [Gregorian melody, modality, and memory: Segmenting chant with Bayesian nonparametrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00380)
*Vojtěch Lanz,Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了格里高利圣歌的旋律是否由特定片段构成（即“拼贴理论”），并通过无监督分层语言模型寻找最优分割，发现其在调式分类中表现优异，但结果不支持拼贴理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究格里高利圣歌旋律的构成方式，验证拼贴理论是否成立，并探索旋律分割与记忆效率的关系。

Method: 使用嵌套分层Pitman-Yor语言模型进行无监督旋律分割，并分析分割结果在调式分类中的表现。

Result: 最优分割在调式分类中达到最佳性能，但分割结果不支持拼贴理论；旋律的开头和结尾更具公式化特征。

Conclusion: 尽管分割方法在调式分类中有效，但格里高利圣歌的旋律构成并非拼贴理论所描述的方式。

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

TL;DR: CAPITAL是一个因果提示框架，通过将前门调整引入链式思维推理，提升隐式情感分析的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的大语言模型方法依赖多数投票，未评估因果有效性，易受内部偏见和虚假相关影响。

Method: CAPITAL将总体因果效应分解为输入提示对推理链的影响和推理链对输出的影响，利用编码器聚类和NWGM近似估计，并通过对比学习对齐编码器表示与LLM推理空间。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CAPITAL在准确性和鲁棒性上均优于基线方法，尤其在对抗条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: CAPITAL为将因果推理融入LLM提示提供了原则性方法，并展示了其在偏见感知情感推理中的优势。

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

Motivation: 准确预测不同人群对主观问题的回答具有重要价值。

Method: 使用相对简单的监督方法，评估多种语言模型和提示策略。

Result: 显著提升语言模型与多样化人群的对齐能力，并分析不同群体的对齐差异。

Conclusion: 方法简单通用，提供实用指南和开源基准，促进未来研究。

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

TL;DR: 研究发现，开放的大型语言模型基准测试存在漏洞，通过微调小型模型在公开测试集上“作弊”可以取得高分，但实际泛化能力差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示开放基准测试的潜在问题，强调其可能无法真实反映模型的实际效果。

Method: 构建小型BART、T5和GPT-2模型，直接在公开测试集上微调，测试其在HELM基准上的表现。

Result: 这些“作弊”模型在HELM基准上排名靠前，但泛化能力和实用性有限。

Conclusion: 需结合私有或动态基准测试，并重新评估当前基准测试方法，以确保语言模型评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

Result: 实验表明，分类器在检测广告方面表现优异，优化策略显著提升了广告的隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 研究为广告感知生成系统和鲁棒分类器的开发提供了对抗性共进化框架。

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for
computationally intensive research approaches to theory development. However,
the opacity of these algorithms and lack of transparency and rigour in their
application pose methodological challenges, potentially undermining trust in
research. The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research
is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally
intensive theory construction research.

Result: 在MLQA、XQuAD和PAWS-X等跨语言任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在数据稀缺条件下优势显著。

Conclusion: 该方法具有强通用性和可扩展性，适合复杂语义建模和多语言处理任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

Conclusion: MoR提供了一种通用解决方案，无需任务特定提示，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting
and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need
for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust

Conclusion: SAFER为高风险LLM对齐任务提供了解释、审计和改进奖励模型的有效工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同文化背景（东亚 vs 西方）是否会影响视觉语言模型的注意力模式。

Method: 通过比较分析图像描述，研究VLMs是否表现出整体性或分析性倾向。

Result: VLMs不仅内化了语言结构，还再现了训练数据中的文化行为，表明文化认知可能隐式影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 文化认知可能通过训练数据隐式塑造视觉语言模型的行为。

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Method: 引入LitBench数据集，包括人类标注的故事比较和训练数据，用于评估零样本LLM评委和训练奖励模型。

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet是最强的零样本评委，与人类偏好一致性达73%；训练的奖励模型准确率达78%。

Conclusion: LitBench为创意写作系统的自动化评估和优化提供了可靠资源。

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

Result: GenAI在语言生成任务中表现良好，但在需要稳定语义或领域知识的任务中存在局限。

Conclusion: 建议系统比较不同GenAI模型的表现，并强调实证研究和理论反思的重要性。

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的人工评估协议及其自动化近似方法，用于评估主题模型和文档聚类，验证了LLM代理可以替代人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主题模型和文档聚类评估中自动化指标与人类偏好不一致或专家标注难以扩展的问题。

Method: 设计了一种评估协议，通过人工或LLM代理推断类别并应用于其他文档，收集标注数据验证自动化代理。

Result: 最佳LLM代理在统计上与人工标注无差异，可作为自动化评估的替代。

Conclusion: LLM代理在主题模型和文档聚类评估中可有效替代人工标注，提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用文体学区分LLM生成文本与人类文本，涉及模型归属、知识产权和AI伦理问题，通过实验验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM生成文本的归属问题，保护知识产权，并促进AI伦理使用。

Method: 创建基于维基百科的基准数据集，使用树模型（决策树和LightGBM）结合文体特征进行分类。

Result: 多分类任务中Matthews相关系数达0.87，二分类准确率在0.79到1之间，维基百科与GPT-4的平衡数据集准确率达0.98。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对于特定文本类型，可以有效区分机器与人类生成文本，尤其在LLM日益复杂的背景下具有重要意义。

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型（LLMs）在香港法律判决翻译中的潜力，解决法律术语复杂、文化嵌入细微差别和严格语言结构等挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体框架TransLaw，包含翻译、注释和校对三个代理，支持可定制的LLM配置。

Result: 在13种开源和商业LLM中测试，TransLaw在语义准确性、结构连贯性和风格保真度上优于GPT-4o，但在复杂术语上下文化和风格自然度上仍逊于人类专家。

Conclusion: TransLaw为法律翻译提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，但需进一步优化以接近人类专家水平。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.

Motivation: 数学常被视为文化中立，但问题呈现方式可能隐含文化背景。现有基准如GSM8K主要基于西方文化，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过提示转换和人工验证，为非洲、印度、中国、韩国和日本创建了文化适应版本的GSM8K测试集，并评估了六种大型语言模型的表现。

Result: 模型在原始美国中心数据集上表现最佳，在文化适应版本上表现较差，但具备推理能力的模型更具韧性。

Conclusion: 深层推理能力有助于弥合数学任务中的文化呈现差异。

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

<details>

Motivation: 探讨下游缩放定律是否普遍适用，以及其成功条件。

Method: 对现有下游缩放定律数据进行元分析。

Result: 仅39%的情况符合线性缩放趋势，实验设置变化显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 需深入研究缩放定律成功的条件，并关注偏离线性趋势的情况。

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决计算系统发育方法在同源词数据应用中的局限性，尤其是数据规模不足的问题。

Method: 通过从BabelNet自动提取数据集，并基于这些数据生成字符矩阵进行系统发育推断。

Result: 结果显示，提取的数据集生成的系统发育树与已知的金标准树不一致，且其他多语言资源也难以提供更合适的字符矩阵。

Conclusion: 结论指出，当前缺乏适用于大规模同源词数据集的自动生成方法，限制了计算系统发育方法在历史语言学中的应用。

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

Conclusion: 提出利用精选数据集的启发式改进道德自我修正，并指出其在情境学习和模型规模上的泛化挑战。

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Method: 通过大规模预训练消融实验，训练30个模型（参数从2.1亿到10亿），并进行15,000多次微调和评估。

Result: MLM在多数任务中表现更好，但CLM模型更具数据效率和微调稳定性；双阶段训练策略（先CLM后MLM）表现最佳。

Conclusion: 双阶段训练策略在固定计算预算下表现最优，尤其适合从现有CLM模型初始化，减少训练成本。

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

Result: 在四个长视频问答数据集和四种先进视频大语言模型上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了长视频问答的性能，同时减少了计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: ER-EMU有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，提升了模型在动态环境中的适应性和知识保留能力。

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

Conclusion: MR-CLIP展示了在临床应用中扩展的潜力，代码和权重已公开。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视觉推理任务中的表现，发现其在某些场景（如CaughtCheating）中表现极差，揭示了其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在简单任务上表现优异，但在复杂场景（如侦探任务）中是否达到人类水平尚不明确，需进一步研究。

Method: 通过设计CaughtCheating任务（检测照片中的可疑线索），对GPT-o3进行测试，分析其失败原因。

Result: 在CaughtCheating任务中，GPT-o3表现接近零，显示其在复杂视觉推理上的不足。

Conclusion: CaughtCheating任务为MLLMs提供了挑战性测试，成功解决此类任务将推动其达到人类水平的感知与推理能力。

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于进化计算的图像分割方法，用于分析增材摩擦搅拌沉积（AFSD）过程中的完整性。采用粒子群优化（PSO）确定最佳分割阈值，结合梯度幅度分析和距离变换生成新颖的注意力加权可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成像方法难以检测AFSD多层构建中的缺陷和特征，需要更精确的分割和可视化技术。

Method: 结合PSO、梯度幅度分析和距离变换，生成注意力加权可视化，包括自注意力图和多通道可视化。

Result: PSO自动确定最佳阈值（156-173），多通道可视化有效结合边界、空间关系和材料密度数据，成功识别未完全结合和不均匀区域。

Conclusion: 注意力分析方法为AFSD工艺优化和质量评估提供了定量指标。

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据集的计算负担和冗余问题，现有方法在任务无关性或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: AdaDeDup通过密度修剪和模型反馈自适应调整修剪阈值，分区处理数据并保留关键信息。

Result: 在Waymo、COCO等数据集上显著优于基线方法，减少性能下降54%以上，修剪20%数据仍接近原始性能。

Conclusion: AdaDeDup有效提升数据效率，适用于大规模模型训练，代码已开源。

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

Motivation: 医疗VLM在临床应用中潜力巨大，但缺乏系统性安全评估，VSF-Med旨在填补这一空白。

Method: VSF-Med包含三个新组件：文本攻击模板库、视觉扰动校准和八维评分标准，通过z-score标准化生成综合风险指标。

Result: 分析显示，主流VLM在攻击效果持续性、提示注入有效性和安全性绕过方面均存在显著漏洞。

Conclusion: VSF-Med为医疗VLM提供了可复现的安全评估工具，揭示了其潜在漏洞，推动了安全改进。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

TL;DR: MANTA是一个多模态学习框架，通过文本对齐统一视觉和听觉输入，解决了语义对齐、时间同步、多尺度表示和稀疏信息检索等挑战，显著提升了长视频问答和跨模态理解的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法通常将不同模态分开处理，导致表示和推理不一致。MANTA旨在通过文本对齐统一多模态输入，解决这一问题。

Method: MANTA采用信息论优化实现跨模态语义对齐，自适应时间同步，分层内容表示和上下文感知检索，并通过数学框架证明其最优性。

Result: 在长视频问答任务中，MANTA将最先进模型的准确率提升至多22.6%，在30分钟以上视频中提升27.3%，在时间推理和跨模态理解任务中分别提升23.8%和25.1%。

Conclusion: MANTA通过新颖的密度估计技术最小化冗余并保留稀有信号，为多模态表示的统一提供了新基础。

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型感知算法在分布外和代表性不足的环境中表现不佳，尤其是户外机器人因动态光照、季节和天气变化导致视觉场景变化大。

Method: 使用基于扩散的图像增强方法，利用公开的视觉基础模型生成更接近部署环境的训练数据，并通过开放词汇语义分割模型过滤幻觉候选。

Result: 该方法能够更精确地控制训练数据中地面表面的语义分布，并针对部署环境微调模型。

Conclusion: 扩散图像增强方法可扩展至其他环境（如沙地和火山地形），具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型在生成长视频时出现的时间一致性和视觉保真度下降问题。

Conclusion: FreeLong++无需额外训练即可提升现有模型的长视频生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

Conclusion: SelvaBox为热带树冠检测提供了重要资源，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

Conclusion: 该图神经网络方法在植物组件识别上表现优异，为精准农业提供了新工具。

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our
graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for
identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the
IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

Conclusion: FiboSB数据集和改进方法为复杂协作场景中的6D姿态估计提供了基础。

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

Result: 在KITTI数据集上表现出更高的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: VOCAL推动了视觉里程计向更通用和可解释的空间智能发展。

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly

TL;DR: VirtualFencer系统通过无监督学习从视频中提取3D击剑动作和策略，并生成逼真的击剑行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 击剑动作多样且受策略驱动，需要数据驱动建模来捕捉其复杂性。

Method: 开发VirtualFencer系统，从视频中无监督提取3D动作和策略，并生成行为。

Result: 系统能自我对战、与真实击剑手动作对战，并与专业击剑手互动。

Conclusion: VirtualFencer展示了数据驱动建模在击剑运动中的潜力。

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 度假租赁平台中大量未分类的房产图片给旅行者理解空间布局带来挑战，尤其是同类房间多时。

Method: 结合监督式房间类型检测、重叠检测模型和聚类算法，利用多模态大语言模型识别床型。

Result: 整体流程表现优异，显著优于对比学习和预训练嵌入聚类等现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适合实时和数据稀缺环境，为旅行者提供了更好的空间布局理解。

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI方法在多视图X射线分析中难以建立稳健的对应关系，而这对临床诊断至关重要。

Method: 利用数字重建放射影像（DRR）从无标注CT体积自动生成合成X射线视图，并采用基于Transformer的训练预测多视图对应关系。

Result: 在合成和真实X射线数据集上的评估表明，引入对应关系提升了多视图骨折分类的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提升了多视图X射线分析的准确性，可作为预训练策略应用于真实数据。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多保真度模型融合策略，用于减少多实例学习（MIL）方法在数字病理学中的性能波动，提高可重复性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）分类由于高分辨率和尺寸大，通常采用MIL方法，但其性能波动大（可达10-15 AUC点），难以可靠比较不同方法。

Method: 通过训练多个模型少量周期，基于验证分数平均最稳定和有潜力的模型，减少初始化、批次顺序和学习率带来的波动。

Result: 在2个数据集、3种初始化策略和5种MIL方法上进行了2000多次实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于现有MIL模型，减少性能波动，简化超参数调优，提高可重复性且保持计算效率。

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

TL;DR: SR-LoRA利用预训练权重矩阵的稳定秩作为层间秩分配的先验，提升适应性，无需额外搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LoRA方法在领域差距大时适应性不足的问题，避免计算密集型技术。

Method: 基于稳定秩的层间秩分配框架，动态调整低秩结构。

Result: 在领域差距大的少样本任务中表现优于现有自适应LoRA方法。

Conclusion: SR-LoRA在性能和效率间取得更好平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven effective in reducing computational
costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully fine-tuned foundation
models across various tasks. However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts
its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks
are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive
LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or
selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on
computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,
or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable
Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the
stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise
rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic
dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient
redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring
additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with
significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent
adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring
breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated
lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker,
a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization
across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy
incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score
refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification
cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion
pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in
mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455
average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%,
highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

Motivation: 探索文本到视频模型在感知场景可用性（affordance）方面的潜力，使其能够从单张场景图像中推断人类行为。

Method: 通过微调模型，给定场景图像和动作提示，插入符合场景的人类行为，利用跨注意力热图分析模型的固有感知能力。

Result: 模型能够从单张图像中推断人类行为，无需显式条件（如边界框或姿态），并生成合理的行为和场景协调。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练视频模型具备感知场景可用性的潜力，无需额外标注数据即可实现交互式世界模拟。

Abstract: Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator?
We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by
teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and
a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person
into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization,
and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video
generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a
single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body
poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can
uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without
labeled affordance datasets.

Motivation: 现有数据缺乏多摄像头共享场景的维度，MOVi-MC-AC填补了这一空白，为计算机视觉任务提供更丰富的上下文信息。

Method: 通过模拟多摄像头视频场景，生成包含一致对象ID的合成视频，并提供模态分割和内容补全的标签。

Result: 数据集包含5.8百万个对象实例标签，是目前最大的模态分割数据集，并首次提供真实模态内容。

Conclusion: MOVi-MC-AC为计算机视觉领域提供了新的基准，推动了模态分割和内容补全任务的发展。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Method: 提出CGEarthEye框架，包含五个骨干网络；构建JLSSD数据集，采用多级表示聚类和采样策略；结合季节性对比、增强对比和掩码补丁标记对比策略进行预训练。

Conclusion: CGEarthEye的卓越表征能力有望推动吉林一号数据在传统地球观测应用中的更广泛和高效应用。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然因其显式的高斯表示和实时性能而受欢迎，但其依赖准确的初始化，且在优化无序高斯分布和密度控制方面存在不足。

Result: 方法在复杂场景中实现了高保真实时渲染，视觉质量显著提升，与现有最优方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了3DGS的关键问题，为高保真实时渲染提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{Kerbl2023},
addressing challenges in initialization, optimization, and density control.
Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while
supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its
explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate
initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian
distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control
mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided
initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and
faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy
to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with
the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive
density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional
complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve
high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual
quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior
results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real
time.

Motivation: 手写签名在身份识别中具有重要作用，但历史样本中常混杂干扰信息，给识别工作带来挑战。

Method: 采用改进的U-net结构，结合离散小波变换和PCA变换，增强模型去噪能力。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在去噪效果上显著优于传统方法，提高了签名图像的清晰度和可读性。

Conclusion: 该模型为签名分析和识别提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are
widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial
contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In
forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures
requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which
are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.
However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount
of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting
identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising
model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness
of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform
and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The
experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the
traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity
and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical
support for signature analysis and recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对分布外（OOD）样本的预测往往过于自信，因此改进OOD检测对提升机器学习安全性至关重要。

Method: 提出ATLI方法，自适应地确定每个模型特有的有效top-k logits，并将最大logit与其他top-k logits结合。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中，ATLI将FPR95降低了6.73%（相比MaxLogit），并比其他先进方法进一步降低了2.67%。

Conclusion: ATLI方法通过利用更多logits信息，显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Neural networks often make overconfident predictions from out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples. Detection of OOD data is therefore crucial to improve the safety
of machine learning. The simplest and most powerful method for OOD detection is
MaxLogit, which uses the model's maximum logit to provide an OOD score. We have
discovered that, in addition to the maximum logit, some other logits are also
useful for OOD detection. Based on this finding, we propose a new method called
ATLI (Adaptive Top-k Logits Integration), which adaptively determines effective
top-k logits that are specific to each model and combines the maximum logit
with the other top-k logits. In this study we evaluate our proposed method
using ImageNet-1K benchmark. Extensive experiments showed our proposed method
to reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by 6.73% compared to the MaxLogit
approach, and decreased FPR95 by an additional 2.67% compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PlantSegNeRF为植物器官级表型分析提供了高通量方法，支持大规模植物科学模型的发展。

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the
high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits.
Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on
segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ
segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and
generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a
novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),
aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from
multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF
performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate
instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance
IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a
specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to
render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance
information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision
plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved
that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the
commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,
17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the
second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly,
PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance
segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements
of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively.
This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a
high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of
large-scale models in plant science.

Result: 实验表明，基于低分辨率合成图像训练的网络能有效泛化到高分辨率（12MP）真实场景图像。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了域差距问题，为固定焦距相机的图像处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of
field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This
limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those
used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to
form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and
defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained
on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well
in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world
data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially
varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the
scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes
effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

Method: 开发了文本控制掩码获取模块（TMA）、自定义值分配机制（CVA）和潜在掩码注意力模块（LMA）。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效支持ROI自定义和重建质量权衡管理。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了ROI定义和重建质量权衡的自定义需求。

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中高质量训练数据稀缺，现有扩散模型依赖大规模数据集且图像质量不足。

Method: 提出MedDiff-FT方法，包括动态自适应引导掩码、轻量级随机掩码生成器和自动质量评估协议。

Result: 在五个医学分割数据集上，MedDiff-FT的合成图像-掩码对将分割性能平均提升1%（Dice分数）。

Conclusion: MedDiff-FT在生成质量、多样性和计算效率之间取得平衡，为医学数据增强提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often
limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models
provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their
effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on
large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address
these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image
generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce
medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a
data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask
enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a
lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical
randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol
filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask
corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation
datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's
segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework
effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Lift to Match (L2M)的两阶段框架，通过将2D图像提升到3D空间，利用大规模单视图图像实现鲁棒的特征匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征匹配方法依赖稀缺且干净的多视图图像，限制了其泛化能力；传统特征编码器基于单视图2D图像训练，难以捕捉3D感知的对应关系。

Method: 第一阶段通过多视图图像合成和3D特征高斯表示学习3D感知特征编码器；第二阶段利用新视图渲染策略和大规模合成数据训练特征解码器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本评估基准上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: L2M框架通过3D感知特征编码和合成数据训练，实现了跨领域的鲁棒特征匹配。

Abstract: Feature matching plays a fundamental role in many computer vision tasks, yet
existing methods heavily rely on scarce and clean multi-view image collections,
which constrains their generalization to diverse and challenging scenarios.
Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D
images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space,
named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and
diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a
3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and
3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into
the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined
with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed
to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving
generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation
benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust
feature matching.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIV-head的新方法，用于解决在无法微调主干网络情况下的跨域少样本学习问题，性能优于现有方法且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在无法微调主干网络的情况下，如何处理低质量且静态的嵌入表示，以解决跨域少样本学习问题。

Method: 提出MIV-head方法，将少样本分类问题转化为多实例验证任务，无需微调主干网络，计算高效。

Result: 在多个实验设置下，MIV-head性能优于现有适配器方法，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: MIV-head是一种高效且性能优越的跨域少样本学习方法，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

Motivation: 解决单参考视图修复的鲁棒性不足、多视图图像修复的外观不一致以及几何变化导致的几何不一致问题。

Result: 实验证明DiGA3D在多种3D修复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiGA3D通过扩散模型和一致性优化，实现了高效的3D修复。

Abstract: Developing a unified pipeline that enables users to remove, re-texture, or
replace objects in a versatile manner is crucial for text-guided 3D inpainting.
However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks
within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack
robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2)
Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images
with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when
there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and
geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy
for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation.
Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that
propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views
via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D
introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to
further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes. Extensive
experiments on multiple 3D inpainting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. The project page is available at https://rorisis.github.io/DiGA3D/.

Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）因复杂的公式结构和字符布局而面临挑战，频域信息可能提供结构分析的辅助。

Abstract: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) suffers from complex
formula structures and character layouts in sequence prediction. In this paper,
we incorporate frequency domain analysis into HMER and propose a method that
marries frequency domain with HMER (MFH), leveraging the discrete cosine

information for recognizing mathematical formulas. When implemented on various
baseline models, our network exhibits a consistent performance enhancement,
demonstrating the efficacy of frequency domain information. Experiments show
that our MFH-CoMER achieves noteworthy accuracyrates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on

TL;DR: Latent-PMRF通过将PMRF重新建模在VAE的潜在空间中，优化了感知-失真权衡，显著提升了收敛效率和恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PMRF在像素空间建模限制了其与人类感知的对齐能力，因此提出在潜在空间中重新建模以更好地匹配人类感知。

Method: 在VAE的潜在空间中定义源分布，利用VAE的重构误差限制最小失真，并设计更优的VAE架构。

Result: Latent-PMRF在盲脸恢复任务中表现出色，相比PMRF实现了5.79倍的FID加速，且PD权衡更优。

Conclusion: Latent-PMRF通过潜在空间建模显著提升了感知-失真权衡和效率，为图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face
restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve
minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean
Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution
is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its
pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human
perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between
two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which
reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),
facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By
defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum
distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's
reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our
proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and
restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the
superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to
existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a
5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as
open-source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATSTrack提出了一种新的视觉语言跟踪方法，通过对齐视觉和语言输入的时间和空间尺度差异，提升特征修改的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言跟踪中，目标运动导致的视觉输入与语言描述不对齐是主要挑战，现有方法未充分解决时间和空间尺度差异问题。

Method: 将语言描述分解为具有不同属性的短语，并细粒度地修改其特征；引入视觉语言标记以利用前一帧的语言信息指导视觉特征提取。

Result: 实验表明ATSTrack性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: ATSTrack通过时间和空间尺度对齐有效解决了视觉语言跟踪中的不对齐问题。

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖高置信度样本，忽略了低置信度样本的潜力，导致在分布偏移下表现不佳。

Method: 使用单步kNN Mean-Shift优化所有测试样本的特征表示，增强特征紧凑性和类别可分性。

Result: 在OOD和跨数据集基准测试中，MS-TTA表现优于现有方法，实现稳定适应。

Conclusion: MS-TTA无需额外训练即可显著提升CLIP在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization but
struggle with distribution shifts at test time. Existing training-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods operate strictly within CLIP's original
feature space, relying on high-confidence samples while overlooking the
potential of low-confidence ones. We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach
that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step
k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA
improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable
adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances
inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits. Extensive evaluations on OOD
and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that MS-TTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods, achieving robust adaptation without
requiring additional training.

Motivation: 现实世界视频是持续演化的数据流，现有视觉语言模型在持续学习时面临灾难性遗忘和更新冲突的挑战。

Method: 受海马体快速绑定和模式分离机制启发，设计多方向监督模块和对比提示学习方案。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，Bisecle有效缓解遗忘并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: Bisecle为视频语言持续学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

Motivation: 面对面对话是常见的人类活动，但现有的交互式头部生成方法在实时性和真实性上存在局限。

Result: 实验验证了ARIG模型在实时生成和交互真实性上的有效性。

Conclusion: ARIG框架通过改进的运动预测和上下文理解，显著提升了交互式头部生成的实时性和真实性。

Abstract: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the
research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion
responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or
motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise
generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods
have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral
understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time
and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based
frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with
better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion
prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index
prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,
achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction
realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed
conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track
dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through
bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over
long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU
to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that
exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final
progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the
effectiveness of our model.

Abstract: Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to
distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains.
Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining
represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources.
Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs
while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by
distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a
novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named
ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain
data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method
first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models
to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain
style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained
contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a
dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and
representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets
(three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep
classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based
competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical
domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link:

Motivation: 研究大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视觉感知任务中的缺陷，填补系统性研究的空白，并解决潜在的安全问题。

Method: 提出LMM-JND概念及其确定流程，构建包含21.5k参考图像和489k刺激的大规模数据集VPA-JND，分析多种LMMs的表现。

Conclusion: LMM-JND为研究LMMs提供了新视角，其可预测性对安全性至关重要，未来可指导模型优化。

Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual
system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work
has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a
scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across
multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly
advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted
capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual
defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential
security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an
initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots
in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new
concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting
uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,
we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named
VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12
distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where
state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle
with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level
visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language
backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that
may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,
our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective
for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的形状评估方法Configural Shape Score (CSS)，用于衡量模型对全局配置形状的敏感性，发现自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型主要依赖局部纹理线索，忽略了形状配置的重要性，导致特征脆弱且非组合性。论文旨在探索模型能否同时利用纹理和形状线索，并评估其绝对配置能力。

Method: 通过Object-Anagram对测试模型识别能力，提出CSS评分，并分析86种卷积、Transformer和混合模型的性能。

Result: 自监督和语言对齐的Transformer模型（如DINOv2、SigLIP2和EVA-CLIP）在CSS评分中表现最佳，且依赖长程交互作用。

Conclusion: 构建鲁棒且类人的视觉系统需同时整合局部纹理和全局配置形状，而非在两者间做人为选择。

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Laplace-Mamba在恢复质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Laplace-Mamba通过双路径处理解决了SSM的局限性，为图像去雾提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models
(SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their
appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based
approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend
to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting
in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency
prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing.
Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into
low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components
representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized
processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs
for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to
refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.
Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving
downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,
thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency. The

*JianChao Zhao,Songlin Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExPaMoE框架通过可扩展的并行专家混合架构，解决了持续测试时适应（CTTA）中的特征纠缠和灾难性遗忘问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法依赖共享模型参数，易受特征纠缠和灾难性遗忘影响，特别是在大或非平稳域偏移时。

Method: 提出ExPaMoE框架，采用双分支专家设计和基于频率域线索的动态扩展专家池。

Result: 在CIFAR-10C、CIFAR-100C、ImageNet-C等基准测试中表现优异，并引入ImageNet++作为新基准。

Conclusion: ExPaMoE在CTTA任务中展现出强大的鲁棒性、可扩展性和抗遗忘能力。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt
on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts.
However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across
all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic
forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address
this limitation, we propose \textbf{ExPaMoE}, a novel framework based on an
\emph{Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts} architecture. ExPaMoE decouples
domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design
with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool
based on a \emph{Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator} (SODD) that
detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse
CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including
CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{ImageNet++}, a large-scale and
realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to
better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE
consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability,
and resistance to forgetting.

TL;DR: LLaVA-SP通过添加六个空间视觉标记增强视觉表示，提出新投影器和两种变体，在多模态任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-ViT在捕捉局部关系时表现不佳，影响MLLMs的细节理解能力，需要改进视觉表示。

Method: 提出LLaVA-SP，添加空间视觉标记，使用卷积核生成视觉空间标记，并设计两种变体（Cropping和Pooling）以处理不同视觉任务。

Result: LLaVA-SP在多模态基准测试中表现优异，性能超过LLaVA-1.5，推理延迟几乎相同。

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP通过简单但有效的改进显著提升了视觉表示能力，适用于多样化视觉理解任务。

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，实现了性能和计算开销的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: SCING框架简单高效，显著提升了跨模态对齐和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in adapting vision-language pre-training models like CLIP
for person re-identification (ReID) tasks often rely on complex adapter design
or modality-specific tuning while neglecting cross-modal interaction, leading
to high computational costs or suboptimal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective
Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and
robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key
innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a
lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into
text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed
Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training
strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image
perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented
cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular
benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID,
and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed
method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining
efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and
computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during
laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular
structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose
significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we
introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for
laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN
dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information
and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a
boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D
features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology.
Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which
contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to
ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive
experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves
outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential
for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在真实场景中难以捕捉用户意图，现有数据集局限于全场景描述或路径预测，无法评估VLMs对局部用户驱动查询的响应能力。

Method: 提出Box-QAymo数据集，包含层次化评估协议，从基础能力测试逐步到属性预测、运动理解和时空推理。通过众包细粒度对象类别和视觉属性，构建时间基础的问答对。

Result: 评估显示当前VLMs在感知问题上的显著局限性，突显了与现实世界性能的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更鲁棒和可解释的自动驾驶系统奠定了基础，支持真实条件下的有效用户沟通。

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

Motivation: CLIP虽然表现优异，但某些注意力头可能对最终表示产生负面影响，消融这些头可能提升性能。

Method: 提出AAT方法，通过操纵注意力权重来抑制特定头的贡献，并结合两种策略适应不同场景。

Result: AAT在多种任务中一致提升性能，跨模态检索任务的召回率最高提升11.1%。

Conclusion: AAT能高效优化大规模视觉语言模型，且不增加推理成本。

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

Result: 在公开数据集和新数据集上验证了方法的有效性，实现了SOTA渲染质量并消除混叠。

Conclusion: LOD-GS框架显著提升了3D高斯溅射的渲染质量，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent
challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate
aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often
resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this
limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework
for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering
strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of
basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to
model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These
basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an
end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and
camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on
down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,
overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive
assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at
varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our
newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering
quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been
open-sourced.

Motivation: 零样本骨架动作识别任务因从已知动作泛化到未知动作的困难而极具挑战性。现有方法在骨架特征判别性和对齐偏差方面存在不足。

Method: 提出PGFA方法，包括端到端跨模态对比训练框架和原型引导的文本特征对齐策略，以改善骨架-文本对齐并减少分布差异的影响。

Result: 在NTU-60、NTU-120和PKU-MMD数据集上，PGFA相比SMIE方法分别实现了22.96%、12.53%和18.54%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: PGFA通过改进骨架特征判别性和对齐策略，显著提升了零样本骨架动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen
skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during
training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in
generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use
two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories
using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text
features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text
alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is
hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed
skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective
skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and
unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided
feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,
termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive
training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient
discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a
prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact
of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and
empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared
with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy
improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD
datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: OOD检测对开发可靠、安全的AI系统至关重要，为研究者提供了导航和未来方向。

Abstract: The ability to detect objects that are not prevalent in the training set is a
critical capability in many 3D applications, including autonomous driving.
Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object
categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes
present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real
world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely
ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate
significantly from the training distribution. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of OOD detection within the broader scope of trustworthy
and uncertain AI. We begin with key use cases across diverse domains, introduce
benchmark datasets spanning multiple modalities, and discuss evaluation
metrics. Next, we present a comparative analysis of OOD detection
methodologies, exploring model structures, uncertainty indicators, and
distributional distance taxonomies, alongside uncertainty calibration
techniques. Finally, we highlight promising research directions, including
adversarially robust OOD detection and failure identification, particularly
relevant to 3D applications. The paper offers both theoretical and practical
insights into OOD detection, showcasing emerging research opportunities such as
3D vision integration. These insights help new researchers navigate the field
more effectively, contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and robust

Conclusion: ReStraV为AI生成视频检测提供了高效低成本解决方案，并揭示了神经表示几何学的新应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: Sim-MPNet通过相似性记忆先验和动态更新策略，有效提升医学图像分割精度。

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

Abstract: Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students'
engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper
addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through
facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant
progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions,
academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity
of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel
dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140
students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,
laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual
study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators
using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,
enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the
first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that
annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking
at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER
(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes
learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively
integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results
demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed
for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately
recognizing academic emotions. Project page: https://zgsfer.github.io/CAER

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

Method: 利用视觉基础模型提取场景特征和意图，生成多模态轨迹，并通过世界模型选择器评估最佳轨迹。

Result: 在nuScenes和NavSim基准测试中表现优异，L2误差降低18.1%，碰撞率减少46.7%，训练收敛速度提高3.75倍。

Conclusion: World4Drive展示了自监督学习在自动驾驶中的潜力，显著提升了性能并减少了标注成本。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from
raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to
extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing
an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,
end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present
World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision
foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating
multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts
scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations
enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It
then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene
features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future
states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector
module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception
annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between
actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the
latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual
perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim
benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower
collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence. Codes will be accessed at

### [104] [De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels to Enhancing Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00608)
*Zehua Fu,Chenguang Liu,Yuyu Chen,Jiaqi Zhou,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeSimPL的新方法，通过减少训练中简单样本的比例，提升自标记检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通和运输场景中的目标检测需要大量高质量标注数据，而自标记检测器因简单样本比例过高（简单标签偏差）性能受限。

Method: 提出DeSimPL方法，利用实例级记忆库更新伪标签，并引入对抗样本和自适应加权损失。

Result: 实验表明DeSimPL显著减少了简单样本比例，提升了自标记检测器的性能。

Conclusion: DeSimPL有效解决了简单标签偏差问题，验证了其在多个基准测试中的优越性。

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMDATrack提出了一种统一域适应框架，能够在多种恶劣天气条件下保持高质量的目标状态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对良好光照条件下的目标跟踪，但在恶劣天气（如夜间或雾天）下性能显著下降。

Method: 使用可控场景生成器合成少量未标记视频，设计域定制适配器（DCA）和基于最优传输的目标感知置信对齐模块（TCA）。

Result: UMDATrack在实验中显著超越现有先进视觉跟踪器，达到新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: UMDATrack通过域适应技术有效提升了恶劣天气条件下的目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual object tracking has gained promising progress in past decades. Most of
the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in
well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios
with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the
tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this
paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality
target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a
unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable
scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than
2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the
guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet
effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects'
representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant
model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between
source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment
module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and
lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Z-Z188/UMDATrack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于低细节城市模型的空中视觉定位新方法LoD-Loc v2，通过粗到细的策略实现高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高细节城市模型，但全球多数可用或规划中的模型为低细节，限制了无人机定位潜力。

Method: 采用建筑分割网络和显式轮廓对齐，结合粗姿态选择和粒子滤波细化，实现低细节模型定位。

Result: LoD-Loc v2在高细节模型上提升精度，首次实现低细节模型定位，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LoD-Loc v2扩展了定位适用范围，为全球城市定位提供了新可能。

Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low
Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method
LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.
However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the
majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct
nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD
city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To
address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization
over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc
v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.
Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by
uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose
probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of
alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose
with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a
particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used
to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose
estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two
datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries
and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2
improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with
low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and
broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

Conclusion: 模块化设计易于适应其他人体运动应用，展现了方法的通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Accepted in the ICIP 2025
  We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that
addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and
stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose
Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion
continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to
high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction
data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large,
diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations
transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability,
and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other
human-motion applications.

TL;DR: ONLY是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过单次查询和一层干预，有效减少大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的幻觉问题，适用于实时应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在多模态任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题，影响其在实际应用中的可靠性。现有方法需多次查询，效率低。

Method: 提出ONLY方法，通过文本到视觉熵比选择性放大关键文本信息，仅需单次查询和一层干预。

Result: 实验表明，ONLY在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且实现简单、计算成本低。

Conclusion: ONLY为LVLM的实时部署提供了高效解决方案，显著减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

TL;DR: CageAttack提出了一种基于笼形变形的对抗攻击框架，通过结构化变形生成自然的对抗点云，平衡了可转移性、不可防御性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在点云上施加严格几何约束，限制了可转移性和不可防御性；而变形方法可能导致不自然的扭曲。

Method: 构建目标对象的笼形结构，通过扰动笼顶点实现平滑变形，确保变形自然且合理。

Result: 在三个数据集上的七个3D深度神经网络分类器上，CageAttack在可转移性、不可防御性和合理性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CageAttack通过结构化变形框架，有效生成了自然的对抗点云，为对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints
to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit
transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative,
existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making
adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In
this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that
produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around
the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking
deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which
seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting
deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility.
Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three
datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among
transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然具有线性复杂度，但其性能显著低于标准Softmax Attention。论文旨在分析性能下降的原因并提出改进方法。

Method: 基于对线性注意力公式的分析，发现其忽略了查询的幅度信息。作者提出MALA，通过调整线性注意力的计算方式，引入查询的幅度信息。

Result: MALA在多个任务（如图像分类、目标检测等）中表现出色，性能接近Softmax Attention。

Conclusion: MALA通过引入查询的幅度信息，显著提升了线性注意力的性能，同时保持了线性复杂度的优势。

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

Motivation: 现有方法多将多视角图像生成视为2D任务，缺乏显式3D建模，而结构化表示对自动驾驶场景生成至关重要。

Method: BEV-VAE训练多视角图像的变分自编码器构建BEV潜在空间，并使用潜在扩散变换器生成场景，支持任意视角生成和可选3D布局。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，BEV-VAE在3D一致重建和生成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: BEV-VAE通过结构化表示实现了多视角图像的3D一致生成，为自动驾驶场景提供了可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene
understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as
a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue
that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially
for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent
and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image
variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then
generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports
arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D
layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance
in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有方法在一致位置嵌入和时序多属性学习方面存在局限性，影响了道路网络重建的准确性。

Method: TopoStreamer引入了流式属性约束、动态车道边界位置编码和车道段去噪三项关键技术。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上，TopoStreamer在车道段感知任务中mAP提升了3.4%，在中心线感知任务中OLS提升了2.1%。

Conclusion: TopoStreamer通过改进时序一致性和多样性学习，显著提升了车道段拓扑推理的准确性。

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Motivation: 零样本域适应（ZSDA）因目标域缺乏图像而具有挑战性，现有方法依赖手动设计的提示，忽略了检测任务与视觉语言模型的不对齐问题。

Method: UPRE框架结合多视图域提示和视觉表示增强模块，并引入多级增强策略（如相对域距离和正负分离）。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上的实验表明，UPRE在零样本域适应检测场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: UPRE通过联合优化提示和视觉表示，有效解决了任务与模型不对齐问题，提升了零样本域适应性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the
lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their
zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address
domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection
task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement
(UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual
representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain
prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific
knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain
style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies,
including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which
align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual
representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at

Result: 实验验证了该方法能有效检测多种模型窃取攻击。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化模型提供了一种安全、鲁棒的所有权验证方案。

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs在多图像任务中的推理和泛化能力，为复杂场景应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding
in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance
degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image
compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in
cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the
reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach
begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for
cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to
identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using
the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL
to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\%
improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain
reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach
exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\%
and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks,
respectively.

Abstract: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

*Selim Kuzucu,Muhammad Ferjad Naeem,Anna Kukleva,Federico Tombari,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUViT通过协同预训练策略解决LLM与ViT模态不匹配问题，提升视觉任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM的语义知识和推理能力增强视觉任务，但直接融合因模态不匹配导致效果不佳。

Method: 采用MAE预训练ViT和LoRA层联合优化，实现LLM与ViT的协同适应。

Result: LUViT显著提升下游视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: LUViT为利用LLM知识进行视觉理解提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision
Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging
the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a
fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between
text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct
fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from
unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the
vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce
Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges
this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT
co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked
Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and
(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM
block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to
produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual
information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT
significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,
showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for
visual understanding.

Abstract: Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在语义对齐和计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 分布感知噪声优化模块；2. 硬件高效的token剪枝策略。

Result: 在Animal-Animal等数据集上实现最先进的提示-图像一致性，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: OptiPrune同时优化语义对齐和计算效率，适用于资源受限硬件。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often struggle to achieve accurate semantic
alignment between generated images and text prompts while maintaining
efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Existing approaches
either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or
compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we
propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial
noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both
challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware
noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial
latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as
subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient
token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise
similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned
tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method
preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient
inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark
datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves
state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced
computational cost.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic
human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and
just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles
complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating
forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method
effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and
complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for
realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on
the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used
iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK,
and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both
simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with

Abstract: 3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient
privacy, calling for reliable and efficient models suited for clinical
practice. However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity,
restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them
beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We
introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with
spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach.
TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation
priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical
flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame
strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into
a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results
demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with
preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVALRY-V是一种针对视频多模态大语言模型（V-MLLMs）的对抗攻击框架，通过双目标语义-视觉损失函数和高效的两阶段生成器，显著提升了攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索V-MLLMs在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，解决跨模态推理、时间依赖性和计算限制等挑战。

Method: 提出双目标语义-视觉损失函数和两阶段生成器框架，结合预训练和微调。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，CAVALRY-V显著优于现有攻击方法，平均提升22.8%。

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V展示了在多模态系统中进行对抗研究的潜力，尤其在跨模态和时间一致性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PSD测量方法（如筛分和激光衍射）耗时且受限于粒子重叠，需要自动化、高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用Blender生成逼真的合成粒子图像，训练三种CNN架构（ResNet-50、InceptionV3、EfficientNet-B0）预测PSD参数（d10、d50、d90）。

Result: 三种模型精度相当，其中EfficientNet-B0计算效率最高，适合工业实时部署。

Conclusion: 合成数据可有效训练CNN，为工业PSD监测提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate particle size distribution (PSD) measurement is important in
industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizer manufacturing,
significantly influencing product quality and operational efficiency.
Traditional PSD methods like sieve analysis and laser diffraction are manual,
time-consuming, and limited by particle overlap. Recent developments in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable automated, real-time PSD estimation
directly from particle images. In this work, we present a CNN-based methodology
trained on realistic synthetic particle imagery generated using Blender's
advanced rendering capabilities. Synthetic data sets using this method can
replicate various industrial scenarios by systematically varying particle
shapes, textures, lighting, and spatial arrangements that closely resemble the
actual configurations. We evaluated three CNN-based architectures, ResNet-50,
InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, for predicting critical PSD parameters (d10,
d50, d90). Results demonstrated comparable accuracy across models, with
EfficientNet-B0 achieving the best computational efficiency suitable for
real-time industrial deployment. This approach shows the effectiveness of
realistic synthetic data for robust CNN training, which offers significant
potential for automated industrial PSD monitoring. The code is released at :

Motivation: 无人机图像中的小目标、高密度分布和复杂背景给目标检测带来挑战，现有算法依赖手工组件且泛化能力有限，需要针对性解决方案。

Conclusion: HEGS-DETR有效解决了无人机目标检测的挑战，性能显著提升且计算高效。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial
challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and
cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on
hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit
limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is
threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic
architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,
resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks
have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address
these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time
Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the
High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.
HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust
semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and
occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object
Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with
minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.
Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware
Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and
localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing
explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset
demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase
over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter
count by 4M.

Motivation: 降水临近预报对天气敏感行业至关重要，但现有深度学习模型多依赖2D雷达反射率，忽略了3D雷达数据中的垂直信息。

Method: 使用ETH作为辅助输入变量，通过3D U-Net模型处理雷达反射率和ETH，分析其对降水预报的影响。

Result: ETH在低雨强阈值下能提升预报技能，但在高雨强下效果不一致且低估降水强度。

Conclusion: 研究为评估额外变量对临近预报性能的潜在贡献奠定了基础，但需进一步优化ETH的使用方法。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

Conclusion: UAVD-Mamba通过多模态融合和多尺度处理显著提升了无人机目标检测性能。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in
traffic management, agriculture, emergency rescue, etc. However, it faces
significant challenges, including occlusions, small object sizes, and irregular
shapes. These challenges highlight the necessity for a robust and efficient
multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable
potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a
multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To
improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block
(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from
deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,
which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal
feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared
(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba
Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature
fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for
small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale
feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba
(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to
the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In
particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and
cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more
discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show
that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.

Abstract: Robust high-definition (HD) map construction is vital for autonomous driving,
yet existing methods often struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data.
This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure
accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key
components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module
and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module.
G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize
the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera
views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV
representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these
components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map
generation. SafeMap is easy to implement and integrates seamlessly into
existing systems, offering a plug-and-play solution for enhanced robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that SafeMap significantly outperforms
previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, highlighting its
superior performance and reliability.

Conclusion: 视觉上下文学习在组合任务中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to
enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during
test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on
training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than
individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple
intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision
pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the
properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a
particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for
training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation
engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation
datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional
tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives
to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex,
compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights
especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯点云的场景中心化视觉语言模型，通过语言和任务感知的场景表示，解决了现有方法对物体检测器的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言模型依赖物体检测器，导致处理瓶颈和分类灵活性受限。

Method: 将语言特征直接嵌入3D高斯点云表示，并通过双稀疏化器生成任务相关的全局和局部场景标记。

Result: 在域外设置下，性能比现有3D视觉语言模型提升五倍。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了基于高斯点云的视觉语言模型，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene
understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong
generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in
out-of-the-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image2GS提出了一种从单图像重建逼真3D场景的新方法，专注于图像到3D的转换部分，通过解耦可见区域重建和未可见区域补全问题，提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单图像重建3D场景的挑战，特别是图像到3D转换部分的确定性任务需求。

Method: 使用优化的3D高斯散点生成的可见性掩码，在训练中排除不可见区域，专注于可见区域的重建。

Result: 在可见区域的重建质量显著优于基线方法，且在全场景评估中与最先进的判别模型竞争。

Conclusion: 判别模型在处理未可见区域时存在困难，而专注于图像到3D转换的专门技术具有优势。

Abstract: We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing
specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction
process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model
representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating
content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable
for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from
optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view
during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves
reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.
Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains
competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target
images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the
fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and
demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct
problem with specialized techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用单张术中图像和术前数据训练NeRF的方法，解决了手术场景中多视图数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在3D重建和视图合成中表现优异，但在手术场景中多视图数据难以获取，限制了其应用。

Method: 结合术前MRI数据和术中图像，通过神经风格迁移生成训练集，实现快速单图像NeRF训练。

Result: 在四个神经外科案例中验证，重建质量和纹理保留表现优异，与真实数据相似度高。

Conclusion: 证明了单图像NeRF训练在手术场景中的可行性，突破了传统多视图方法的限制。

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

Conclusion: RTMap能有效支持下游预测和规划模块，并异步提升众包地图的准确性和实时性。

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and
solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion
in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose
RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a
multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap
simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)
Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)
probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)
real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on
several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on
both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating
our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning
modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the
crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标准基准测试主要评估准确性而非鲁棒性，PDE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过程序生成3D场景，测试模型对物体、相机、材质和光照变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 揭示了当前先进深度模型在特定扰动下的挑战。

Conclusion: PDE为深度估计研究提供了新的评估工具，有助于未来改进模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth
estimation, particularly as measured by the success of large models on standard
benchmarks. However, performance on standard benchmarks does not offer a
complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art
depth models, which we hope will inform further research. Code and data are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成方法在渲染视觉文本时存在模糊、语义漂移和风格控制有限的问题，且多分支设计增加了模型复杂性和灵活性不足。

Method: 采用分割模型提取精确文本掩码，结合改进的扩散模型和区域特定损失，以保持文本内容和风格的保真度。

Result: 在AnyText基准测试中表现最佳，显著优于现有方法，并在新提出的GlyphMM和MiniText基准测试中大幅领先。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂排版和小文本区域生成中表现出色，验证了其强大的泛化能力和部署准备性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet
accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs,
semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on
pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original
font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that
increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we
propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks
-- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional
inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual
segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined
diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a
region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,
significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To
enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:
GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex
typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in
small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at
small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong
generalization and deployment readiness.

Abstract: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to
advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key
findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We
first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential
through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the
final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then
unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability
enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving,
video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents,
and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this
field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art

TL;DR: ShapeEmbed是一种自监督表示学习框架，用于编码2D图像中物体的轮廓，生成对平移、缩放、旋转、反射和点索引不变的形状描述符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形状量化中提取的测量值对固有几何变换（如大小、方向和位置变化）保持不变性的核心挑战。

Method: 使用欧几里得距离矩阵表示物体轮廓，通过自监督学习框架ShapeEmbed生成不变形状描述符。

Result: ShapeEmbed的描述符在自然和生物图像的形状分类任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeEmbed在生物成像应用中具有潜在的重要价值。

Abstract: The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide
range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to
ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that
preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,
orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,
a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the
contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,
into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of
traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by
our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on
natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular
relevance to biological imaging applications.

Motivation: 现实世界视频超分辨率面临复杂且不可预测的退化问题，现有方法难以同时保证时间一致性和细节生成。

Method: 提出DAM-VSR框架，将VSR解耦为外观增强（通过参考图像超分辨率）和运动控制（通过视频ControlNet），并采用运动对齐的双向采样策略。

Result: DAM-VSR在真实世界和AIGC数据上实现了最先进的性能，展示了强大的细节生成能力。

Conclusion: DAM-VSR通过解耦外观和运动，有效结合了生成先验和细节生成能力，为视频超分辨率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due
to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize
image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation
capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We
attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address
this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of
SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos.
To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion
disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into
appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance
enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion
control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully
leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail
generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped
with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can
conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail
generation capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI中的视觉元素多样性和空间杂乱性，以及语言的歧义性，使得自然语言查询在GUI中的定位具有挑战性。

Method: 将GUI拆分为文本元素和图标元素，利用通用视觉语言模型独立处理每种模态，并通过动态聚焦和分层细化优化定位结果。

Result: 在标准GUI定位基准测试中表现优于基线方法，证明了模态分离与区域聚焦推理的有效性。

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI通过动态视觉定位和模态感知优化，无需额外训练即可显著提升GUI自然语言查询的准确性。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

Result: 实验显示TalentMine在查询任务中达到100%准确率，远超AWS Textract的0%和40%。

Conclusion: TalentMine通过语义增强显著提升表格提取性能，为人才管理系统提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: In talent management systems, critical information often resides in complex
tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

Motivation: 现有IMU传感器的人类活动识别（HAR）模型缺乏透明性，且数据覆盖范围有限，限制了其在实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出SEZ-HARN模型，结合零样本学习和自解释能力，生成骨架视频以解释决策。

Result: 在PAMAP2等四个数据集上，SEZ-HARN的零样本识别准确率接近最佳黑盒模型，同时提供可理解的解释。

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN在保持高准确率的同时，显著提升了模型的透明性和实用性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出VoyagerVision，一种多模态模型，通过视觉反馈扩展LLM在空间环境中的任务能力，并在Minecraft中验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过视觉输入增强大型语言模型（LLM）的空间理解能力，以扩展其开放性和任务多样性。

Method: 提出VoyagerVision模型，利用截图作为视觉反馈，在Minecraft中构建结构。

Result: VoyagerVision平均在50次迭代中创建2.75个独特结构，并在平坦世界中成功完成一半的构建任务。

Conclusion: 视觉反馈显著提升了LLM的空间任务能力，为开放性和多模态研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“逆向推理”的新范式，使大语言模型（LLMs）能够事后分解和解释其推理链。通过SAGE-nano模型，展示了其在推理准确性和解释质量上的优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在推理任务中决策过程不透明的问题，提升模型的可解释性和透明度。

Method: 采用逆向推理范式，通过元认知结构和注意力机制反向分析推理链，生成解释。

Result: SAGE-nano在AQUA-RAT等测试中表现出色（推理准确率74.6%，解释质量92.1%），性能接近Claude-3.5 Sonnet或GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为透明AI系统开辟了新途径，提升了AI安全性、教育和科学发现中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自动化方法，从黑盒遗留系统中提取可解释的决策逻辑，并通过决策树生成人类可读的规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如行为克隆）仅复制输入输出行为，无法捕捉底层意图，而遗留系统缺乏文档和理解，导致现代化改造困难。

Method: 使用强化学习代理探索输入空间，识别关键决策边界，并通过K-Means聚类和决策树训练提取可解释规则。

Result: 在三种复杂度的虚拟遗留系统上验证，提取的规则准确反映了系统核心逻辑。

Conclusion: 该方法为遗留系统迁移中的规范和测试用例生成提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Method: 采用实验设计，随机分配学生至AI辅助（ChatGPT）或非辅助（对照组）条件，完成议论文写作任务并使用CES-AI量表评估认知投入。

Result: ChatGPT组的认知投入得分显著低于对照组。

Conclusion: AI辅助可能导致认知卸载，需结合教学策略以促进学生主动反思AI生成内容，避免影响自主学习和深度认知投入。

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

Method: 利用生成式AI，通过四步结构化流程（任务相关数据识别、患者摘要生成、预测建模、临床解释）增强预测和解释性。

Result: 在HAIM-MIMIC-MM数据集上，xHAIM将平均AUC从79.9%提升至90.3%。

Conclusion: xHAIM将AI从黑盒预测器转变为可解释的决策支持系统，提升了临床实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

Conclusion: 机器学习与传统运筹学方法的结合为解决新兴VRP变体提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide
future research and address emerging VRP variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强非推理型语言模型（如Llama 3）的推理能力，填补现有方法对搜索行为内部化不足的空白。

Method: 利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）生成合成数据集，将搜索轨迹转化为自然语言链式思考，结合强化学习（RL）进行微调。

Result: 在MATH-500、AMC 2023和AIME 2024等数学任务上，性能分别提升16.0%、26.9%和20.0%。

Conclusion: 搜索启发的训练方法为开源大语言模型提供了稳健的推理能力提升途径。

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Motivation: 研究数学推理能力的提升是否代表LLM在更广泛问题解决中的进步，还是仅仅是对特定任务的过拟合。

Method: 评估20多个开源推理模型在数学、科学问答、代理规划、编码和指令遵循等任务中的表现，并对Qwen3-14B模型进行数学数据的不同微调方法实验。

Result: 多数数学表现优异的模型在其他领域表现不佳；RL微调的模型具有更好的跨领域泛化能力，而SFT微调的模型容易遗忘通用能力。

Conclusion: 建议重新思考后训练方法，减少对SFT蒸馏数据的依赖，以提升推理模型的通用性。

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提高了SMT-NRA的搜索效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory
of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否可以通过RL在象棋中发展策略推理能力，填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 利用预训练的象棋动作价值网络为LLM的输出动作质量提供密集奖励（知识蒸馏），并与稀疏二进制奖励进行对比。

Result: 密集奖励通常优于稀疏奖励，但所有模型的表现均远低于专家水平。

Conclusion: 模型表现受限的原因可能是预训练模型对象棋的内部理解不足，仅靠RL难以完全克服。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）中因信息扩散导致的精度损失问题，将其重新定义为信息论通信问题。

Method: 引入HDRAM框架，将Transformer潜在空间视为扩频信道，结合经典纠错码、全息计算和量子启发搜索，实现高效键值操作和Grover式搜索。

Result: HDRAM显著提升了关联检索性能，无需改变模型架构。

Conclusion: 通过经典-全息-量子启发（CHQ）原则，HDRAM为Transformer架构提供了新的强化方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC

### [162] [Deciding When Not to Decide: Indeterminacy-Aware Intrusion Detection with NeutroSENSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00003)
*Eyhab Al-Masri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeutroSENSE是一个基于中性逻辑的集成框架，用于物联网环境中的可解释入侵检测，通过分解预测置信度为真、假和不确定分量，实现不确定性量化和选择性审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升物联网环境中的入侵检测准确性和可解释性，同时量化不确定性以支持更可信的决策。

Method: 结合随机森林、XGBoost和逻辑回归，引入中性逻辑分解预测置信度，并使用全局和自适应阈值标记高不确定性预测。

Result: 在IoT-CAD数据集上达到97%准确率，错误样本的不确定性显著高于正确样本（0.62 vs. 0.24）。

Conclusion: 中性逻辑提升了准确性和可解释性，为边缘和雾计算物联网安全系统提供了信任感知的AI基础。

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DS3的框架，用于优化大型语言模型（LLM）的推理成本，通过技能图随机遍历实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在训练和推理阶段消耗大量资源，现有方法未能充分优化推理成本，尤其是在任务难度和模型能力变化时。

Method: 引入DS3框架，将推理建模为技能图的随机遍历，并通过闭式表达式分析不同推理策略（如CoT和ToT）的性能和成本。

Result: 理论分析揭示了线性精度与对数计算的关系，以及任务难度和模型能力对推理策略选择的影响。

Conclusion: DS3框架深化了对训练-推理相互依赖的理解，为算法设计和资源分配提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在电梯调度中具有显著优势，能够高效处理复杂性和随机性。

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CMIM的训练方法，旨在构建不可蒸馏的深度神经网络（DNN），以保护知识产权。通过最小化交叉熵损失和条件互信息（CMI），CMIM模型在实验中表现出不可蒸馏性，且自身预测精度优于仅使用交叉熵训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了保护DNN的知识产权，需要构建不可蒸馏的DNN，即无法通过知识蒸馏（KD）方法有效提取其知识的模型。

Method: 提出CMIM训练方法，通过联合最小化交叉熵损失和温度缩放后的条件互信息（CMI）值，训练DNN。

Result: 实验表明，CMIM模型对所有测试的KD方法均不可蒸馏，且其预测精度优于仅使用交叉熵训练的模型。

Conclusion: CMIM方法成功构建了不可蒸馏的DNN，同时提高了模型自身的性能，为知识产权保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，ST-MTM在预测性能上优于现有掩码建模、对比学习和监督预测方法。

Conclusion: ST-MTM通过分解和针对性掩码策略，有效捕捉复杂时序语义，提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python
repositories. All code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉变换器（ViT）的新架构，通过引入对抗指示器（AdvI）令牌来检测和防御对抗攻击，结合训练时和运行时防御，降低了系统复杂性，并在实验中优于多种竞争方法。


<details>

Motivation: 变换器在自动调制分类中表现出色，但易受对抗攻击影响，因此需要一种有效的防御策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在白盒攻击场景下优于其他竞争方法，如快速梯度法和投影梯度下降攻击。

Conclusion: AdvI令牌在ViT中有效检测和防御对抗攻击，提供了一种统一的防御解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

Motivation: 大型预训练模型微调需要大量计算和存储资源，现有方法如GPS虽减少参数但增加资源需求。

Method: GRFT选择梯度平方和最高的行或列进行更新，并结合正则化提升知识迁移。

Result: 在FGVC和VTAB数据集上仅需更新1.22%和0.30%的参数，性能优于GPS、Adapter Tuning和LoRA。

Conclusion: GRFT高效且有效，显著减少资源需求并实现最优性能。

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 结论是SFT可视为隐式奖励学习的特例，改进方法显著提升性能，并扩展了LLM logits与Q函数的理论关系。

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

Conclusion: 研究为经典机器学习工作流中量子启发数据转换的优化提供了指导。

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Conclusion: 深度生成模型在McMC方法中的应用可提升高维贝叶斯推断的适应性和效率。

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

Conclusion: AIMatDesign展示了在闭环材料发现中的可靠性和潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

Result: 在四种动态系统上测试，FNSDA在泛化性能上优于或与现有方法相当，且参数成本显著降低。

Conclusion: FNSDA通过傅里叶空间适应实现了高效泛化，为复杂动态系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our
code is available at https://github.com/WonderSeven/FNSDA.

Result: 实验表明，ROSE在揭示先进LLMs的安全漏洞方面优于现有方法，综合评估指标显著提升。

Conclusion: ROSE为更实用和现实导向的LLMs安全评估迈出了一步。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiT-JEPA提出了一种分层框架，用于学习多尺度城市轨迹表示，结合细粒度细节和高层语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时捕捉轨迹的细粒度细节和高层摘要，限制了其对长期依赖和局部细微差异的关注。

Method: HiT-JEPA采用三层层次结构，逐步捕获点级细节、中间模式和高层轨迹抽象。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，HiT-JEPA的分层设计能生成更丰富的多尺度表示。

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA通过分层设计有效整合了局部动态和全局语义，提升了轨迹表示的多样性。

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

TL;DR: LoRA-Mixer是一种轻量级MoE框架，通过动态路由任务特定的LoRA专家提升参数效率和任务保真度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合LoRA与MoE时存在参数效率低和任务保真度不足的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出LoRA-Mixer框架，替换注意力模块的线性层投影矩阵为动态路由的LoRA专家，支持联合优化或直接部署预训练模块。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，如GSM8K、HumanEval和MedQA分别提升7.61%、4.88%和3.08%，且参数效率更高。

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer在参数效率和性能上优于现有方法，适用于多种基础模型。

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

Conclusion: 自适应时间抽象为实时应用（如游戏和机器人）提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and
mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal
action repetition rates based on state contexts. Experiments on Atari 2600
games demonstrate significant performance improvements over static duration
baselines, highlighting the efficacy of adaptive temporal abstractions in DRL.
This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming
and robotics, where dynamic action durations are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模人类流动性对于理解疫情传播和及时干预至关重要，但稀疏的空间数据限制了传统时间序列模型的预测能力。

Method: 提出SPN技术，通过聚合相邻六边形网格单元的信号来增强特征，并在三种预测模型（NLinear、PatchTST、K-U-Net）上评估。

Result: SPN显著提升了预测性能，测试MSE最高降低9.85%。

Conclusion: 空间平滑稀疏流动性信号是一种简单有效的时空预测方法，适用于公共卫生危机。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic
spread and deploying timely interventions. In this work, we leverage a
large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

Result: 传统CHF相关性在非均匀加热条件下表现不佳，而仅基于均匀数据训练的神经网络无法推广到空间变化场景。

Conclusion: 研究为后续的迁移学习策略、不确定性量化和设计优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to
generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models
that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these
curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork
for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification,
and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰山漂移对气候系统和极地导航至关重要，但现有方法因数据稀缺和复杂非线性运动难以准确预测。

Method: IDRIFTNET结合冰山漂移物理的解析公式与增强残差学习模型，通过旋转增强谱神经网络捕捉全局和局部模式。

Result: IDRIFTNET在预测南极冰山A23A和B22A的轨迹时，FDE和ADE均低于其他先进模型。

Conclusion: IDRIFTNET能有效捕捉冰山复杂非线性漂移，为有限数据和动态环境下的轨迹预测提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate
system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems
while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately
forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of
iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg
motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a
highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These
limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture
the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address
these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep
learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift
physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the
pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth
observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network
that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future
iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with
state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings
demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final
Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety
of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing
the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories
under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型融合因内部表示差异（如排列不变性、随机初始化或不同分布的训练数据）而具有挑战性，需一种更有效的方法。

Method: 设计了一种神经元中心的融合算法，通过分组中间神经元并利用神经元属性评分，创建目标表示，由融合模型的子网络近似。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该算法在零样本和非独立同分布场景中优于现有融合技术。

Conclusion: 该算法能有效整合不同训练数据分布的模型，性能优于传统方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在大规模数据集中选择最优实例以提升数据质量和训练效率的核心挑战。

Method: 1. 使用PVI量化实例难度并静态过滤低难度实例；2. 采用渐进学习法按PVI升序训练分类器。

Result: 移除10%-30%数据仅损失0.0001%-0.76%准确率；渐进学习法提升0.8%准确率并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 有效的数据缩减策略可提升模型性能和训练效率，PVI框架成功应用于跨语言任务。

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are

Conclusion: 研究为图分类中质量度量的选择提供了指导，并验证了预处理方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

<details>

Motivation: 语音界面在人类-计算机交互系统中至关重要，而语音情感识别（SER）可以根据用户情绪定制响应。由于人类通过多模态的音频-视觉线索传达情感，开发基于这两种模态的SER系统是有益的。然而，收集大量标记数据成本高昂。

Method: 提出LiSER框架，利用大型教师模型（基于先进的语音和面部表示模型）从无标记的音频-视觉数据中提取知识，并将其传递给轻量级学生模型。

Result: 在RAVDESS和CREMA-D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，LiSER可以减少SER任务对大量标记数据的依赖。

Conclusion: LiSER通过知识蒸馏有效利用未标记数据，为语音情感识别提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill为多任务学习提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，尤其适用于资源受限的平台。

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

Conclusion: FPG为利用长期依赖关系提供了数学基础，且无额外计算开销。

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统混合语言模型中因频繁调用LLM导致的通信开销问题，同时保持高准确性。

Method: 集成不确定性感知推理与联邦学习，动态优化阈值；利用P2P解析和分层模型聚合减少LLM调用。

Result: 在大规模新闻分类任务中，LLM传输减少95%以上，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: FedHLM适用于高效、可扩展的边缘AI应用，显著降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

*Wei Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为IA-STGNN的新框架，用于解决战略级模拟中战术打击行为与战略延迟之间缺乏结构化因果建模的问题，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前战略级模拟中，战术打击行为与战略延迟之间的因果建模存在结构性瓶颈，尤其是在捕捉中间变量（如“韧性-节点压制-谈判窗口”链）方面。

Method: 提出了IA-STGNN框架，结合图注意力机制、反事实模拟单元和空间干预节点重建，动态模拟打击配置和同步策略。训练数据来自多物理模拟平台（GEANT4 + COMSOL），符合NIST SP 800-160标准。

Result: 实验表明，IA-STGNN在MAE上降低了12.8%，Top-5准确率提高了18.4%，同时提升了因果路径一致性和干预稳定性。

Conclusion: IA-STGNN为高级政策建模提供了结构化且透明的AI决策支持机制，适用于核威慑模拟、外交窗口评估和多策略优化等应用。

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic
delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual
simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable
dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies.
Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +
COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and
policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN
significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5
percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention
stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and
supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window
assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and
transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GFEN的新框架，通过图融合技术和混合方法提升交通速度预测的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测方法难以处理复杂的时空动态和非平稳数据，限制了预测的适应性和准确性。

Method: GFEN结合了拓扑时空图融合技术和基于注意力的深度学习结构，动态提取多尺度时空特征并平滑数据。

Result: 实验表明，GFEN的预测精度比现有方法高6.3%，收敛速度是其他混合模型的两倍。

Conclusion: GFEN在交通预测中表现出卓越性能，有望显著提升系统效率。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Conclusion: pUniFind为蛋白质组学提供了统一的深度学习框架，显著提升了灵敏度和可解释性。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most
models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We
present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in
proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open,
zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived
spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality
prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets,
particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified
peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind
identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a
300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module
further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the
genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion
coverage. These results establish a unified, scalable deep learning framework
for proteomic analysis, offering improved sensitivity, modification coverage,

Result: LSTM模型以0.86的平衡准确率优于其他方法，能有效预测高风险期。

Conclusion: 该框架将安全检查数据转化为明确的风险评分，支持资源优化分配和事故预防。

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident
forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences
as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then
aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To
ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply
a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time
series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level
metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression,
tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared
within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming
high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness
of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can
anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed
methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk
scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers
can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection
priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites
or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and
getting the greatest return on safety investments.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统质量控制方法依赖人工定义阈值，缺乏适应性；数据驱动方法虽高效但缺乏可解释性，工业场景中难以接受。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了数据驱动故障检测的可信度和可解释性，适用于工业质量控制。

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在文本到关卡生成中表现优异，无需依赖复杂语言模型，且通过GUI提升了实用性。

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

Result: 建立了多种局部更新算法的紧上下界，并扩展至在线联邦学习，提供了在一阶和bandit反馈下的基本遗憾界。

Conclusion: 论文阐明了局部更新算法在异构环境中的优势条件，为分析Local SGD提供了系统指导。

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

Result: 实验表明，标准RL算法在这些环境中仍具竞争力，但需新方法以充分发挥RL潜力。

Conclusion: Gym4ReaL填补了RL测试环境的空白，为应对现实世界复杂性提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性问题，现有PFL方法在协作与数据结构匹配上表现不佳。

Method: 采用自适应协作，客户端通过共享未标记数据的预测进行协作，基于私人和公共数据一致性调整损失权重。

Result: FEDMOSAIC在多种非IID设置下优于现有PFL方法，并提供收敛性保证。

Conclusion: 数据感知协作在实现鲁棒和有效的个性化方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and
personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to
each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or
centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they
enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive
collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on
others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We
instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in
which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This
enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with
parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the
agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global
pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence.
Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across
diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard
assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration
for robust and effective personalization.

*Alexis Carrillo,Asieh Abolpour Mofrad,Anis Yazidi,Moises Betancort*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究通过计算模型探讨拒绝关系对刺激等价（SE）的影响，发现人工神经网络可能依赖联想学习而非SE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨拒绝关系是否会影响刺激等价的形成，以及人工神经网络是否能真正展示SE。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络（FFN）、BERT和GPT模型，在18种条件下进行匹配样本模拟，比较不同训练结构和关系类型。

Result: 拒绝关系影响模型表现，但高准确性可能与联想学习类似，而非真正的SE。

Conclusion: 人工神经网络可能依赖联想策略，需更严格的标准评估SE模型。

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Q学习和双DQN中普遍存在的高估问题，探索更有效的深度强化学习方法。

Method: 提出深度双Q学习（DDQL），通过训练两个Q函数并相互引导来减少高估。

Result: DDQL显著减少高估，并在57款Atari 2600游戏中表现优于双DQN。

Conclusion: DDQL是一种无需额外超参数的高效方法，能有效减少高估并提升性能。

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

Result: 在三个数值实验中验证了方法的准确性和计算效率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结构保持的Lift & Learn方法在非线性PDE降阶中表现出色，兼具高效性和物理一致性。

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine
learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach
based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses
knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent
quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics
obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making
model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted
quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms
analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained
optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a
structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields
computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the
underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the
generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed
structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the
one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the
two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional
Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed
learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving
data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Method: MamNet整合时域建模（Mamba模块）和频域特征提取（傅里叶变换），通过多尺度信息融合增强异常检测能力。

Result: 在UNSW-NB15和CAIDA数据集上，MamNet在准确率、召回率和F1分数上优于其他模型，性能提升2%-4%。

Conclusion: MamNet能有效捕捉多时间尺度的网络流量异常，适用于网络安全和流量管理。未来可结合外部事件信息进一步优化。

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

Method: AutoDS利用贝叶斯惊讶量化LLM对假设的信念变化，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）策略和渐进扩展，以惊讶作为奖励函数。

Conclusion: AutoDS是迈向开放自主科学发现系统的重要一步，通过贝叶斯惊讶驱动探索，显著提升了发现效率和质量。

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

Conclusion: μ²LLM在有限数据下表现出色，展示了其在RRG任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

Result: 未观察到原假设的情绪类别特异性脑模式，而是发现显著的个体间差异。

Conclusion: 科学结论受初始假设影响，需通过多种分析方法验证假设。

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

Method: 提出了一种模型无关、数据驱动的探索机制，动态调整熵正则化（critic）和策略方差（actor）。

Result: 数值实验表明，自适应探索加速了收敛并改善了遗憾性能，匹配了已知的次线性遗憾界。

Conclusion: 自适应探索机制在减少调参需求的同时，显著提升了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were
previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve
regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based
counterparts.

Conclusion: MoNE是一种高效且鲁棒的专家剪枝方法，显著减少内存开销并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying
MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain
all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory
costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable
degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources,
and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes
Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that
replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and
robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two
metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and
stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased
estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline
methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions,
confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average
zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\%
pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning. The code is available at

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

Result: 实验表明DDMP在PLL任务中表现优越，能够逐步优化标签预测。

Conclusion: DDMP通过生成模型有效解决了标签模糊问题，为PLL提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical
machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning}
(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels
associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of
diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their
potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.
Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the
perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively
refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model
to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the
generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label
for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch
between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model
for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information
between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial
diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to
estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated
during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is
progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage
of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

Conclusion: 通过理论改进和实际应用结合，HAX显著提升了长上下文建模的效率与效果。

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to
existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Result: 在GVGAI和Ludii游戏框架中测试，Optimistic-WS在平均简单遗憾方面显著优于现有最佳臂识别算法。

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS能显著提升多任务领域中算法评估的质量和准确性，适用于高运行时算法场景。

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

Abstract: We present a Transformer architecture for long-context language modeling that
combines global attention with two biologically inspired components: chunked
local attention and a gated FIFO memory mechanism. This unified attention block
allows the model to efficiently handle both short-range and long-range
dependencies without increasing attention cost quadratically. The memory module
persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism
inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per
attention head to enable directionally disentangled, scale-invariant positional
signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with
no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular
experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks
such as dialogue modeling, code completion, and document understanding.

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

Result: 实验证明PNAct能有效操纵Safe RL代理执行不安全行为，验证了后门攻击的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Safe RL的后门攻击风险，为未来研究提供了安全防御方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

Motivation: 解决Boltzmann Exploration（B-exp）在大型动作集上的可扩展性问题，同时保持探索概率的一致性。

Method: 使用von Mises-Fisher分布采样状态嵌入表示，并探索其最近邻，避免计算每个动作的softmax值。

Result: 理论证明vMF-exp与B-exp的探索概率一致，实验验证了其在模拟数据、真实数据和音乐推荐系统中的有效性。

Conclusion: vMF-exp是B-exp的可扩展替代方案，适用于具有超球面嵌入的大型动作集探索。

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable
method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where
hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves
initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher
distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which
scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under
theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability
of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular
alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires
computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a
scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with
hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public
data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender
system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key
properties of the proposed method.

Result: 模型在零样本预测任务中表现优异，与完全微调的Transformer基线相当，证明了其捕捉复杂临床依赖关系的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需任务特定微调即可有效建模EHR数据，为医疗领域的预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly
task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统强化学习在高维空间中效率低下，量子强化学习（QRL）通过量子计算的叠加和纠缠特性提升效率，但现有QRL研究中的PQC结构未经优化。

Method: 提出QRL-NAS算法，结合QNAS优化PQC结构，利用参数化量子电路进行线性和非线性变换。

Result: 实验表明，QRL-NAS比固定电路结构的QRL获得更高的奖励，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: QRL-NAS通过优化PQC结构提升了量子强化学习的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏好强化学习（PbRL）在奖励信号难以明确的环境中表现优异，但收敛速度慢且优化不可靠。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出残差奖励模型（RRM），将环境真实奖励分为先验奖励和学习奖励两部分，先验奖励来自用户猜测或逆强化学习，学习奖励通过偏好训练。

Result: 实验表明，RRM显著提升了PbRL方法的性能，加速了策略学习，并在真实机器人任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RRM方法有效结合先验知识，提升了PbRL的效率和性能，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

*André Ribeiro,Ana Luiza Tenório,Juan Belieni,Amauri H. Souza,Diego Mesquita*

TL;DR: Sheaf diffusion lacks cooperative behavior due to missing message directionality. The paper introduces directed cellular sheaves and proposes Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs), which outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if sheaf diffusion can exhibit cooperative behavior and address its limitations in message directionality.

Method: Introduces cellular sheaves over directed graphs, defines in- and out-degree Laplacians, and proposes CSNNs.

Result: CSNNs achieve better performance than prior sheaf diffusion and cooperative GNNs, with selective attention to nodes.

Conclusion: CSNNs successfully address the limitations of sheaf diffusion by enabling cooperative behavior and improving performance.

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph
representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data
and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been
proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by
allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information
from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of
exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to
this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods
fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality.
To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over
directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We
leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).
Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows
nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring
all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments
show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on
sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

Result: 实验表明，提出的策略能平滑损失景观，找到最小描述长度解，提升性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为GANs的正则化策略提供了新视角，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人脑资源管理策略，可以构建更高效、鲁棒和智能的AI系统。

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 实验显示，与仅使用GNSS的KF相比，定位误差减少了29%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次将深度学习与道路网络数据结合，显著提升了GNSS定位性能。

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

Conclusion: 音频输入在3D视觉任务中具有潜力，Audio-3DVG为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate

### [238] [A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00695)
*Daniel Pfrommer,Max Simchowitz,Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于奖励作为“测试函数”的新框架，用于分析增量输入到状态稳定性（δISS），揭示了强化学习价值函数与增量稳定性之间的新等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制理论使用Lyapunov函数证明稳定性，而强化学习的价值函数基于非光滑、无界的奖励函数构建，无法直接作为Lyapunov证书。本文旨在探索价值函数与增量稳定性之间的新联系。

Method: 通过将增量输入到状态稳定性与Hölder连续奖励函数下价值函数的正则性建立等价关系，提出了一种新的分析框架。

Result: 证明了增量稳定性与价值函数正则性之间的等价性，为理解强化学习中的稳定性提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 该框架为控制理论与强化学习的结合提供了新的理论基础，突破了传统Lyapunov方法的限制。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing
Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using
rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with
Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement
learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a
Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides.
Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov
certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental
input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the
regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a
H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity
of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be
understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based
approach to certifying stability in control theory.

*Chong Zhang,Xichao Liu,Yibing Zhan,Dapeng Tao,Jun Ni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCAWaveNet的新型空间-通道注意力网络，用于从GNSS数据中提取有效波高（SWH），通过融合空间和通道信息，显著降低了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在处理CYGNSS数据时，未能充分利用跨通道信息交互，限制了性能提升。

Method: 设计了空间-通道注意力机制，将DDMs的每个通道特征建模为独立注意力头，并融合空间和通道信息。

Result: 在ERA5和NDBC浮标数据上，SCAWaveNet的平均RMSE分别为0.438 m和0.432 m，比现有模型至少降低3.52%和5.47%。

Conclusion: SCAWaveNet通过有效利用跨通道信息，显著提升了SWH提取的精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive
global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant
wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly
utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt
single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the
benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address
this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely
SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each
channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the
fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a
lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial
and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and
channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using
four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves
an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE
reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the
average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC
buoy observations. The code is available at

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在推理任务中的表现是否真实反映其能力，揭示其过度思考的局限性。

Method: 在AIME2024数学基准上测试三种最先进模型，分析其推理行为。

Result: 模型无法有效整合纠正信息，生成冗长但无效的推理链，导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在推理任务中的关键局限性，为提升其鲁棒性和可解释性提出新挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing
evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains
of thought (CoTs), calling into question whether benchmark gains reflect real
reasoning improvements. We present new evidence of overthinking, where models
disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing
to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect
conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024
math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate
corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and
interpretable reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的序数分类不确定性量化方法，分解为固有变异性和知识不足两部分，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序数分类问题在医学和金融等领域普遍存在，但现有研究主要关注名义分类和回归，缺乏对序数分类不确定性的有效量化。

Method: 通过将序数分类问题转化为二元分类，基于熵和方差的度量方法，结合梯度提升树和多层感知机进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，该方法在错误检测和分布外检测中表现优异，显著优于标准方法。

Conclusion: 序数分类问题的特殊性在不确定性评估中至关重要，本文方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are
prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate
uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric
(inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial
for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused
on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal
classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and
variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively
capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and
minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted
trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our
method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and
variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification
rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show
competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification
problems when assessing uncertainty.

Result: 实验表明，OrderedLogitNN在复杂任务上表现显著优于其他方法，平衡DRPS提供了鲁棒且公平的评估标准。

Conclusion: 该研究为QDE任务提供了序数回归方法和公平评估指标，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults
using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty
component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user
experience. However, such reports are often ambiguous and lack detail, making
this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
addressing such issues. This study evaluates 27 open-source models (1B-72B
parameters) and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies: Zero-Shot,
Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted
98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13
million output tokens. We achieve f1-score up to 0.76. Results show that three
models offer the best balance between size and performance:
mistral-small-24b-instruct and two smaller models, llama-3.2-1b-instruct and
gemma-2-2b-it, that offer competitive performance with lower VRAM usage,
enabling efficient inference on end-user devices as modern laptops or

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate
realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict
how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire
and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We
present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a
new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed
outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the
inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models
typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a
single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect
physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This
technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for
anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment
and response planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain
real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited
by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning
dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting
environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert
demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are
incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based
learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments
compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force
optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations
significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with
GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the
potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods
complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and
enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy
function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules.
Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows
that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to
match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining
likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it
impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning
the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained
with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic
interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we
combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function.
On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free
energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with
exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between
metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced

quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code
level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared
classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV
prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal
links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved
92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical
algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted
HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart.
Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV
cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable
influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and
efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.
This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance,
the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices
are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making
under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to
learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous
uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their
effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust
optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically
by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing
actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that
this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability
as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage
stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can
now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an
information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain
information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We
present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory
assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in
online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach
has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous
setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.
While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it
does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual
signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both
the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows
for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing
waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the
ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to
health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of
significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily
rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological
changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A
reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely
intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,
where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In
this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To
this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables
early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals
recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the
recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and
trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we
incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection
of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a
subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all
potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to
minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed
deviations.

Conclusion: 通过增强拓扑表示，结合GNN和transformer的优势，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Motivation: 现有3D分子生成模型依赖强归纳偏置（如SE(3)和置换等变性），但仍难以保证物理合理性。TABASCO旨在通过简化模型架构解决这一问题。

Method: TABASCO采用标准非等变变换器架构，将分子中的原子视为序列，生成后确定性重建键。

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant
inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph
message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated
molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which
relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer
architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds
deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and
message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and
scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves
state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster
than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance
despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training
minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such
as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our
implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了FL中的隐私和量化异构性问题，提升了学习效用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional

*Antonis Vasileiou,Timo Stoll,Christopher Morris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架，用于分析消息传递图神经网络（MPNNs）在归纳和转导节点与链接预测任务中的泛化能力，并量化了图结构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MPNNs在节点和链接预测中应用广泛，但其泛化能力仍未被充分理解，尤其是节点和链接级别的预测。现有研究常依赖不现实的独立同分布假设，忽略了节点或链接间的相关性。

Method: 作者引入了一个统一框架，结合多种架构参数和损失函数，分析MPNNs的泛化性能，并量化图结构的影响。

Result: 实证研究支持了理论分析，深化了对MPNNs在这些任务中泛化能力的理解。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于图数据，还可扩展到任何归纳或转导分类任务。

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link
prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has
led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in
practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains
poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in
graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and
link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@
assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and
assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the
influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to
analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive
node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural
parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure.
Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond
graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.
Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our
understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

TL;DR: SEPAL是一种可扩展的嵌入传播算法，用于大规模知识图谱，通过核心实体优化和消息传递生成高质量嵌入，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法主要针对链接预测优化，且难以扩展到大型图谱，SEPAL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SEPAL通过优化核心实体嵌入并通过消息传递传播到整个图谱，实现全局嵌入对齐。

Result: 在7个大规模知识图谱和46个下游任务中，SEPAL显著优于现有方法，并能扩展到大型图谱。

Conclusion: SEPAL为大规模知识图谱提供了一种高效、可扩展的嵌入方法，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large
knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to
distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream
applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:
they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive
learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory
limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation
ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality
embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce
global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of
entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message
passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream
machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms
previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base
embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

Motivation: 研究如何利用自适应推理方法提升LLM在安全领域的鲁棒性，以应对越狱和有害请求。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）方法，结合链式思维追踪和平衡安全与任务完成的奖励信号，设计了三个关键步骤：轻量级SFT预热、混合提示训练和防止推理能力退化的奖励函数。

Result: TARS训练的模型在模糊查询上分配更多计算资源，实现了更好的安全与拒绝平衡，并提升了对抗白盒和黑盒攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TARS为训练LLM提供了一种有效的开放方法，能够通过逐提示推理抵御越狱和有害请求。

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

Motivation: 现有研究从遍历性角度解释训练过程，但缺乏统一框架来加速训练并区分真正的收敛与统计稳定化。

Method: 通过分析目标函数的几何景观，引入Lyapunov指数诊断；提出幽灵类别扩展，增加辅助输出节点以绕过早期训练中的不良区域。

Result: 幽灵扩展严格减少近似误差，且在收敛后幽灵维度消失，模型行为与原模型一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为架构层面的干预提供了理论支持，加速早期训练同时保持渐近性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列并行方法因高通信开销成为瓶颈，限制了线性注意力模型处理超长序列的能力。

Method: 提出ZeCO序列并行方法，利用All-Scan通信原语最小化通信开销，实现端到端近线性扩展。

Result: 在256 GPU上处理8M长度序列时，ZeCO比现有最优方法快60%。

Conclusion: ZeCO为高效训练下一代LLM提供了可行路径，解决了长序列训练的难题。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language
Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient
processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing
Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads
across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication
overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)
sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to
overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for
long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length
across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an
16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new
collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with
precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal
communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.
Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only
negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication
costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that
All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on
256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a
clear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously
intractable sequence lengths.

Conclusion: VLTL-Bench填补了现有研究的空白，为可验证NL-to-LTL翻译提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

Motivation: 锂离子电池在电动汽车和电网存储等实际应用中需要高精度的电化学模型以确保安全和高效运行，但现有降阶模型难以捕捉高倍率条件下的非线性行为。

Method: 结合扩展单粒子模型（ESPM）与进化集成稀疏学习策略，构建混合模型，并采用保形预测方法量化不确定性。

Result: 混合模型（ESPM + AESI）在多种工况下显著提高了电压预测精度，均方误差降低达46%，保形预测提供了统计有效的预测区间。

Conclusion: AESI框架通过增强模型精度和可靠性，为锂离子电池的实际应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient
operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as
electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a
balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to
capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell
voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations,
this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework
that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by
compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended
Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning
strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework
incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed
uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the
reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating
conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage
prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on
unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal
prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage
ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and
stability selection, respectively.

Conclusion: CaaS是管理多星座DS2D连接的高效可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising
solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of
satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

Conclusion: 该理论为窄网络的泛化能力提供了通用框架，并验证了其在梯度下降训练中的准确性。

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple
input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance
on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is
trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves
as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical
account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the
presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop
such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of
hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from
statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical
performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk
minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In
doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons
specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to
the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the
generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification
tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or
full-batch gradient descent.

Result: 实验显示该方法能自动识别约三分之二的错误程序，且无假阳性报告。

Conclusion: 不连贯性方法可替代oracle评估LLM，且与oracle评估结果高度一致。

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years
have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the
increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase
in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning
of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,
Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,
opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical
benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for
subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the
surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,
or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training
RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,
whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we
explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that
balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the
associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb
benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

Motivation: 人类越来越依赖LLM支持社会决策，但其长期影响未知，尤其是对基于间接互惠和声誉的人类合作的影响。

Method: 通过21种LLM评估合作行为，并结合进化博弈论模型分析LLM驱动的评判对社会合作动态的影响。

Result: LLM在评判合作行为时对“好对手”有一致性，但对“坏声誉”个体存在差异，这些差异显著影响合作行为的普遍性。

Conclusion: LLM的评判标准需谨慎对齐，以维护人类合作行为，提示导向的干预可有效塑造LLM的评判标准。

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions
in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral
and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based
social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected
when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a
pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect
reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.
Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide
21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate
-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these
interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary
game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where
the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of
LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating
cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and
between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.
We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact
the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,
showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through
goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term
social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order
to preserve human cooperation.

language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex
environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Twill框架解决了在异构移动边缘平台上调度复合AI（cAI）系统的挑战，通过任务亲和性集群映射、优先级感知任务冻结/解冻和DVFS，显著降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: cAI系统在移动边缘平台上的部署面临动态工作负载和异构计算的挑战，现有方法无法满足需求。

Method: 提出Twill框架，结合任务亲和性集群映射、优先级感知任务冻结/解冻和DVFS技术，优化推理调度。

Result: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin NX平台上，Twill平均降低推理延迟54%，同时满足功耗预算。

Conclusion: Twill为cAI系统在边缘计算中的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent
agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this
article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are
semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used
for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey
aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and
to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban
intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is

Conclusion: 相位和幅度量化的CvHNNs为复杂网络提供了更多可能性。

Abstract: This research paper introduces two novel complex-valued Hopfield neural
networks (CvHNNs) that incorporate phase and magnitude quantization. The first
CvHNN employs a ceiling-type activation function that operates on the
rectangular coordinate representation of the complex net contribution. The
second CvHNN similarly incorporates phase and magnitude quantization but
utilizes a ceiling-type activation function based on the polar coordinate
representation of the complex net contribution. The proposed CvHNNs, with their
phase and magnitude quantization, significantly increase the number of states
compared to existing models in the literature, thereby expanding the range of
potential applications for CvHNNs.

Motivation: 传统连续吸引子网络对噪声和异质性敏感，而离散化方法虽提高稳定性但牺牲分辨率。本文旨在找到一种同时实现高稳定性和高分辨率的方法。

Method: 采用稀疏二进制分布式编码，基于随机特征嵌入，模拟网格细胞样编码，并通过理论和仿真验证其效果。

Result: 结果表明，这种编码方式能够同时实现高稳定性和高分辨率，并可扩展到非线性流形上的计算。

Conclusion: 该研究为大脑如何高分辨率、稳定地表示连续变量并执行灵活计算提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

Motivation: 现有方法在特征相关时会低估其贡献，导致偏差。

Method: 引入DFI方法，利用最优传输将相关特征转换为独立潜变量，计算重要性并分解。

Result: DFI提供了重要性分解的理论保证，并在潜变量空间和原始特征空间中实现了高效估计。

Conclusion: DFI解决了相关性导致的偏差问题，具有计算效率和理论支持。

Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when
predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their
contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical
population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this
correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature
Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$
decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into
independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation
distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed
back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled
decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability
for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA
variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general
transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of
importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original
feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve
second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and
transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI
avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the
challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving
computational efficiency.

Result: 在多个数据集（包括天文模拟）上验证了Aux-VAE的有效性。

Conclusion: Aux-VAE通过辅助变量成功实现潜在变量的解耦，为复杂数据的生成因子提取提供了新方法。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative
factors from complex, high-dimensional datasets in unsupervised or
semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative
models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling
low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors.
Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational
Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to
the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge
through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent
space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate
the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets,
including astronomical simulations.

Motivation: 现有方法在节点级隐私保护上存在局限性，要么仅支持查询式输出，要么无法保留网络结构。

Method: 提出GRAND机制，基于潜在空间模型，确保发布的网络与原网络具有相同的渐近分布。

Result: 实验验证了GRAND在合成和真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: GRAND填补了节点级差分隐私在网络数据发布中的空白，并保留了关键结构属性。

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding
sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various
domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level --
remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus
exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified
network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the
network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node
Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring
node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a
broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network
asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The
effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅理论上严谨，还通过蒙特卡洛模拟展示了其在薛定谔桥过程终维分布中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is
central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and
begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte
Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric
way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context
of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in
the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we
develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence
rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an
application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final
dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the
constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for
conditional diffusions.

Method: 构建离散概率度量空间证明PW为距离，提出多种初始化策略，引入PW重心概念并设计算法计算。

Result: 新方法在点云对齐和形状保持方面优于现有OT方法，并在考古学中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PW距离在机器学习和计算几何的点云分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and
reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an
optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to
tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that
application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability
measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to
solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by
discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the
notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data.
The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection
of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and
shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an
archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting
2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry
applications.

Abstract: Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within
interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk
assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based
clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify
the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our
method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures,
cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable
node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect
trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level
data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate
how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market
intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers.
The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based
clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional
behavior in complex market structures.

Result: 混合框架结合物理优化和数据驱动表示，能避免局部最优、提高可扩展性并促进知识迁移。

Conclusion: 未来需关注复杂性管理、几何无关表示、制造约束集成及多物理协同设计的进展。

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures
achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for
recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization
methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces
and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine
learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review
frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of
representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and
input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in
the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates
optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,
latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient
global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique
trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design
discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization
with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve
scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting
open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,
geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,
and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Conclusion: GEM为可扩展、人机交互的地球物理AI奠定了基础，实现从分散到集成的转变。

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural
hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains
fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,
stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each
tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We
introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative
architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference
along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This
formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference
mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,
masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce
geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot
generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining
for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage
training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on
large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts
and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad
applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy
analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic
stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By
bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware
manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical
AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,
promptable reasoning system. Project page: https://douyimin.github.io/GEM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、低信任环境中，AI代理无法通过预先规范或集中监督确保正确性，因此需要一种机制来激励正确行为。

Method: 协议通过发布任务意图，让解决者竞争完成任务，并在事后由验证者检查正确性。挑战者可以通过抵押触发验证过程，错误行为会被惩罚，正确行为会得到奖励。

Result: 当解决者、挑战者和验证者的激励一致时，正确性成为纳什均衡。

Conclusion: 该协议通过激励机制和递归验证确保了AI代理在低信任环境中的行为正确性。

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is
cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

Motivation: 由于晚型T和Y矮星的观测样本稀少，现有检测框架难以覆盖这些最冷、质量最低的褐矮星。

Method: 利用ATMO 2020和Sonora Bobcat模型生成合成光度数据，训练分类器进行光谱类型分类。

Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population
of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics.
Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and
early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs

capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on
synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO
2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of
magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations
fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these
synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify
and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant
when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of
known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type
precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5
degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery
of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of
this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from
photometric catalogs.

### [284] [Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719)
*Anantha Narayanan Suresh Babu,Akhil Sadam,Pierre F. J. Lermusiaux*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: 论文研究了四种生成扩散模型方法，用于从粗、稀疏和不完整的观测数据中实现二维准地转湍流的超分辨率和推断。比较了两种引导方法和两种条件方法，分析了其性能、计算成本和适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值模拟通常分辨率低，观测数据稀疏且不完整，需要高效的方法提升分辨率和填补数据空缺。

Method: 应用了四种生成扩散模型方法：SDEdit、DPS、vanilla变体和无分类器引导方法，测试了不同湍流状态、雷诺数和观测类型。

Result: SDEdit生成不真实的场，DPS成本低但平滑了细节；条件方法能恢复细节且统计特性正确。

Conclusion: 研究权衡了实现难度、保真度和一致性，为地球物理反问题提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are
coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four
generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of
forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from
coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a
pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process
score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and
classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and
observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and
anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two
observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy
observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the
reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and
quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.
We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.
Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates
reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed
fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they
reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with
observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.
Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable
from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs
between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of
the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in
geophysical inverse problems.

Motivation: 理解材料设计中工艺-结构关系需要合成受工艺参数调控的微观结构图像，但现有方法面临数据稀缺和连续变量编码的困难。

Method: 采用SD3.5-Large模型，引入数值感知嵌入编码连续变量（如退火温度、时间、放大倍数），并通过DreamBooth和LoRA微调少量权重。

Result: 生成图像在语义分割中达到97.1%准确率和85.7%平均IoU，物理描述符和空间统计误差低于2.1%和0.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次将SD3.5-Large应用于工艺感知的微观结构生成，为数据驱动的材料设计提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

Motivation: 探索LLM注意力机制的物理基础，验证自旋浴类比是否适用于生产级模型。

Method: 提取GPT-2的Query-Key权重矩阵，推导有效哈密顿量，分析相位边界，并与实际token排名对比。

Result: 理论预测与模型实际token排名呈强负相关（r≈-0.70，p<10^-3），验证了自旋浴类比。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM注意力机制提供了物理解释，并为新型生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and
Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a
first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building
on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a
production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian
for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic
\textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should
dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic
evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong
negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's
empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations
further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath
predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming
a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our
findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy
in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable,
physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for
novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter
physics and AI.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据感知的对齐问题提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware
specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process
models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware
extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This
is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in
the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in
the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with
general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is
possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting,
enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully
combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data
dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving.
Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently
explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application
of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency.
The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance
of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive
data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

Result: 在Duke Breast数据集上，3D-FID得分为0.0054，Dice分数接近真实图像（0.70964 vs 0.71496）。

Conclusion: Med-LSDM生成的合成数据与真实数据差距小，适用于数据增强。

Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both
accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data
availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine
learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM
(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and
leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of
privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that
focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D
semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full
volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D
image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space
of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model
significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical
3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic
medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional
Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images
(0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model
have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing
delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods
for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to
apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are
based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial
information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the
first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach
integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic
sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses
multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel
attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates
synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from
different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean
absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and
approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor. Code is available at:

Method: 使用深度平衡模型（DEQ）将配准问题转化为平衡寻找问题，减少内存消耗并支持无限迭代。

Result: 在脑MRI和肺CT数据集上，DEQReg性能与现有方法相当，内存消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: DEQReg通过平衡机制实现稳定收敛，弥合了传统优化与学习方法的差距。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an
optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,
recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic
this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed
number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient
iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence
guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have
a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with
the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both
theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration
framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration
as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between
classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains
constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.
Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we
show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while
substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art
unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of
existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly
when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,
DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking
mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern
learning-based registration methods.

Conclusion: MTCNet通过运动-拓扑引导的一致性网络，显著提升了四维二尖瓣超声分割的准确性和跨相位一致性。

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at

Result: SDR显著降低了假阴性诊断的概率（召回率提高），并提升了平均精度。

Conclusion: SDR方法在保留临床相关信息方面优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has
led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for
high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality
is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant
information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.
In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering
resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small
and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions
(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we
propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given
an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced

Conclusion: Prompt2SegCXR为基于用户提示的胸部X光片分割提供了可靠解决方案，具有较高的灵活性和准确性。

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating
organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally,
segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting
their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced
models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater
flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained
attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based
on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated
work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,
especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,
generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from
multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,
specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we
introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple
organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage
feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for
better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,
our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest
X-rays based on user prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高对ERM手术类型（ILM移除或仅ERM移除）的分类准确性，以辅助临床决策。

Method: 采用ResNet18 CNN架构，结合术后OCT中心扫描图像，引入OrthLatt-UwU和PR-Relax-UwU两种可调小波单元优化模型。

Result: 预处理后输入准确率72%，OrthLatt-UwU提升至76%，PR-Relax-UwU进一步提升至78%，优于人类评分者的50%。

Conclusion: CNN模型结合可调小波单元能显著提高分类准确性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current
research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of
micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting
detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection
model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a
new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the
backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.
Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to
fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's
ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head
GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more
deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that
compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter
count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by
7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection
accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习模型在颅内动脉瘤检测上有所改进，但高假阳性率仍是临床应用的障碍。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CPM-Net和3D-CNN-TR），并结合基于解剖学的后处理方法（如脑、动脉、静脉分割掩码）以减少假阳性。

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理约束和深度学习，实现了高效、准确的T1映射，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable
clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models
have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation
tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based
on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of
Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in
multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation
mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences
between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with
the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal
MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation
accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.
Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art
diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an
HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided
diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational
cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements
are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine
learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid
method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided
neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the
network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training
process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention
mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for
uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML
dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a
3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model
satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts
below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically
motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in
upcoming cosmological surveys.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维慢-快动力学系统中，传统SINDy方法因回归问题计算复杂且病态，难以有效建模。

Method: 分两步：(i)识别慢流形（快变量作为慢变量的函数），(ii)在流形上学习慢变量动态，并构建定制化的稀疏函数库。

Result: 显著降低了SINDy库的条件数和规模，提高了慢流形上动态识别的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维慢-快系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的建模工具。

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established
as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from
data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression
problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.
Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying
slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables
have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate
terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy
library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and
efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow
manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of
the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables
restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is
leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains
only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than
containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom
library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific
problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a
snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that
our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the
SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow
manifolds.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are
typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory
(DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first
curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million
molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained
with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular
structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in
different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it
can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,
providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.
To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce
geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation
models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D
geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models
trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that
benefit property predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖于与真实目标视图的对比，不适用于生成任务；且不同MVGs的训练数据差异大，缺乏对鲁棒性和泛化性的全面评估。

Method: MVGBench通过三个维度评估MVGs：最佳配置性能、泛化性和鲁棒性，并引入3D自一致性度量方法。

Result: 系统比较了12种MVGs，发现现有方法在鲁棒性和泛化性上的局限性，并提出了ViFiGen方法，在3D一致性上表现最佳。

Conclusion: MVGBench为MVGs提供了严谨的评估框架，揭示了关键设计选择，并推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image
generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture,
image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs
have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing
metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is
not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while
differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on
different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to
these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly.
Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices
contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects:
best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of
comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric
which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We
systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and
synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of
existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we
find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we
propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D
consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

TL;DR: FreNBRDF是一种基于频率修正的神经材料表示方法，通过球谐函数将频域考虑融入神经BRDF建模，提升了材料外观重建和编辑的准确性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖表格化的BRDF数据，而隐式神经表示虽灵活但频域行为理解不足。FreNBRDF旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用球谐函数提出频率修正损失，并将其融入可泛化、自适应的重建与编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，FreNBRDF在材料外观重建和编辑的准确性与鲁棒性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FreNBRDF通过频域修正提升了神经材料建模的保真度、适应性和效率，支持更结构化和可解释的下游任务。

Abstract: Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering,
bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs.
While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has
shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and
flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the
frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce
FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging
spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural
BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a
frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable
and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances
fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance
reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling
more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.

*Binghua Yao,Joris M. Mooij*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: 论文提出了σ-MAGs，扩展了MAGs以支持循环因果关系的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAGs无法表示循环因果关系，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入σ-MAGs，研究其性质并提供马尔可夫等价类的表征。

Result: σ-MAGs能有效表示含潜在变量的循环有向图。

Conclusion: σ-MAGs填补了MAGs的局限性，为循环因果建模提供了新工具。

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These
graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and
d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been
used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI
algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One
significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility
of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We
introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these
graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs
(DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent
DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization
of their Markov equivalence classes.

Motivation: 社交媒体流行度预测对内容优化和用户参与至关重要，但因多模态因素的复杂交互而具有挑战性。

Method: 采用三层次融合架构，整合CLIP编码器的视觉特征、Transformer的文本嵌入、时空元数据和用户特征，结合CatBoost、TabNet和多层感知机，并引入伪标签和迭代优化。

Result: 在SMP Challenge 2025（图像赛道）中获得第三名，表现优异。

Conclusion: HyperFusion通过多模态特征融合和分层集成策略，有效提升了社交媒体流行度预测的准确性。

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content
optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across
digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due
to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral
factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble
learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs
a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across
abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual
embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user
characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy
combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address
limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with
pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal
similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture
inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion
achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team
achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track). The source code

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型控制优化的深度强化学习框架，显式建模并补偿动作执行不匹配问题，提升实际应用中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习方法假设动作执行完美，忽略了实际系统中的不确定性和偏差，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：确定期望动作并选择适当的控制信号以确保正确执行，训练时考虑动作不匹配和控制器修正。

Result: 在五个开源机械仿真环境中验证了框架的鲁棒性，展示了其在控制导向应用中的高效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架弥补了理想化学习与实际实现之间的差距，为工程实践提供了显著进步。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅报告二元任务成功率，掩盖了策略行为中的关键弱点，如协调性差或抓取滑动。

Method: 引入分层语义任务，分解为技能特定阶段，并配以细粒度指标和3000+人类演示。

Conclusion: RoboEval通过揭示策略失败的具体原因，为机器人操作提供了更深入、可操作的评估工具，强调超越单纯成功率的必要性。

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估3D物体检测时未充分考虑速度与精度的权衡，以及硬件差异对实时应用的影响，同时也忽略了检测性能对运动规划安全性的影响。

Method: 引入延迟感知AP（L-AP）和规划感知AP（P-AP）作为新指标，结合nuPlan数据集验证，并通过延迟感知超参数优化（L-HPO）优化模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，新指标能更全面地评估实时3D物体检测，优化后的模型在硬件选择和性能上表现更优，同时纠正了‘点云越多性能越好’的错误假设。

Conclusion: 论文提出的L-AP和P-AP指标为实时3D物体检测提供了更全面的评估方法，优化了硬件和模型选择，提升了自动驾驶系统的整体性能。

Abstract: High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型基于预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs），虽擅长语义理解但缺乏精确的空间理解能力，因仅基于2D图像-文本对训练。

Method: 引入即插即用模块，利用现成的视觉几何基础模型隐式注入3D几何特征，无需额外深度传感器或有损估计。

Result: 在五项需要精确空间理解能力的任务中，该方法显著提升了现有VLA模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥补了VLA模型在空间理解上的不足，为通用机器人感知与行动提供了更强大的支持。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

Motivation: 现有眼动估计技术依赖额外传感器、易受遮挡和光照影响，限制了手术机器人的术前导航精度和一致性。

Method: 结合机器学习和传统算法，无需依赖面部标志点，实现稳定的虹膜检测和眼动估计。

Result: 实验显示，眼动估计平均误差为0.58度，机器人臂运动控制平均误差为2.08度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了眼科手术机器人的眼动估计精度和稳定性，适用于复杂手术环境。

Abstract: Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing
the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

Motivation: 现有基于激光雷达和摄像头的解决方案在视觉遮挡环境中性能不佳，计算开销大且成本高，而雷达传感器虽成本低但存在点云稀疏、噪声和误检问题。

Method: 提出RaGNNarok框架，利用图神经网络增强雷达点云数据，适用于复杂动态环境，且在低成本设备（如Raspberry Pi 5）上高效运行。

Result: 在定位、SLAM和自主导航等任务中表现出高可靠性和泛化能力，推理时间仅7.3毫秒。

Conclusion: RaGNNarok为低成本室内移动机器人提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

Abstract: Modern warehouse automation systems rely on fleets of intelligent robots that

develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring

box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a

significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows
substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

Conclusion: AI生成的视频可作为机器人操作任务的有效监督来源。

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system
that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative vector quantization based action
tokenizer built upon the largest-scale action trajectory dataset to date,
leveraging over 100 times more data than previous approaches. This extensive
dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics,
resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates
smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be
seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,
from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding
of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action
trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of
synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To
validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated
environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the
volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer
on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%
higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and
scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way
for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application
domains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io

Conclusion: PI-WAN通过物理与数据驱动的结合，显著提升了四旋翼在未知环境中的动态建模和轨迹跟踪能力。

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

Conclusion: HumanoidGen填补了双手机器人操作领域的空白，为复杂任务提供了有效的数据生成方法。

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

### [325] [Reconfiguring Digital Accountability: AI-Powered Innovations and Transnational Governance in a Postnational Accounting Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00288)
*Claire Li,David Freeborn*

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI驱动的数字创新如何重塑跨国治理中的组织问责制，结合TAM、ANT和制度理论分析AI技术采纳，提出两种组织策略以促进负责任的AI应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统问责机制因AI系统在审计和财务报告等领域的决策中介作用而受到挑战，需研究如何应对跨国界的监管、伦理和文化压力。

Method: 整合技术接受模型（TAM）、行动者网络理论（ANT）和制度理论，分析组织在跨国背景下采纳AI技术的方式。

Result: 问责制是全球社会技术网络中共同构建的，受用户感知、治理逻辑和规范期望影响，提出内部治理重构和外部网络参与两种策略。

Conclusion: 通过内部和外部策略的结合，可以促进会计领域中负责任且全球接受的AI技术采纳。

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping
organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI
systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and
financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on
control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate
the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and
institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in
response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national
boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global
socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by
governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate
compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.
Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent
property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies
including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network
engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption
in the accounting domain.

### [326] [Integrating Universal Generative AI Platforms in Educational Labs to Foster Critical Thinking and Digital Literacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00007)
*Vasiliy Znamenskiy,Rafael Niyazov,Joel Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了一种将生成式AI（如ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini）融入实验室活动的新教育框架，旨在培养本科生的批判性思维和数字素养。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到对大型语言模型（LLMs）不加批判依赖的局限性和风险，该教学模型将生成式AI重新定义为研究主题和认知工具。

Method: 学生制定学科特定的提示，并评估生成式AI在文本、图像和视频模态中的响应。在一门面向非理科生的普通天文学课程中进行了试点实施。

Result: 试点显示学生参与度高且进行了批判性反思，许多学生在课后继续活动并在研究研讨会上展示成果。结果强调了结构化AI互动在教育中的重要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合反思性评估方法，生成式AI可以提高学习效果，并提出了一种可复制的跨学科AI整合实验室工作模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital
literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of
uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical
model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students
formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in
text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general
astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement
and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class
and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the
importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI
can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods.
The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab
work, adaptable to scientific disciplines. See the guide to learning activities
based on Generative-Ai platforms: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15555802

### [327] [Ken Utilization Layer: Hebbian Replay Within a Student's Ken for Adaptive Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00032)
*Grey Kuling,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: KUL-KT是一种受生物学启发的知识追踪架构，结合了Hebbian记忆编码和基于梯度的巩固方法，具有可扩展性和输入无关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过模拟神经系统的记忆巩固机制，改进学生建模，支持少样本个性化和自然遗忘。

Method: 采用时间衰减的Hebbian记忆更新和Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT)方法，结合快速Hebbian记忆和慢速线性网络。

Result: 在十个公共KT基准测试中表现优异，训练速度更快，内存占用更少，课堂部署中显著提升学习效果。

Conclusion: KUL-KT是一种高效、灵活且生物启发的个性化学习框架。

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.

*Clemente Rubio-Manzano,Jazna Meza,Rodolfo Fernandez-Santibanez,Christian Vidal-Castro*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成式AI对编程教育的影响，提出通过代码可视化和执行模拟改进教学方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI工具对编程课程的影响，探索如何优化教学与评估方法。

Method: 综述相关研究，提出以代码理解和执行模拟为核心的教学方法，并收集学生反馈。

Result: 发现视觉化工具能促进学生深入理解编程，学生反馈支持其应用。

Conclusion: 建议在编程教学中融入代码可视化和执行模拟，以提升学习效果。

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful
new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models.
This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at
universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how
programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of
generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on
this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the
specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and
learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather
than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for
the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its
execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,
thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming
course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the
incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the
training process.

### [329] [Investigating Stochastic Methods for Prosody Modeling in Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00227)
*Paul Mayer,Florian Lux,Alejandro Pérez-González-de-Martos,Angelina Elizarova,Lindsey Vanderlyn,Dirk Väth,Ngoc Thang Vu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文研究了随机方法（如Normalizing Flows、Conditional Flow Matching和Rectified Flows）在生成语音表达性韵律方面的效果，并与传统确定性方法和人类发音进行比较。结果表明，随机方法能生成与人类发音相媲美的自然韵律，并提供额外的可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成语音表达性韵律是文本到语音合成中的挑战，尤其是通过明确参数（如音高、能量和时长）建模的系统。随机方法可能提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 比较了随机方法（Normalizing Flows、Conditional Flow Matching、Rectified Flows）与传统确定性方法及人类发音的效果。

Result: 随机方法生成的韵律与人类发音相当，并能通过调节采样温度提供额外可控性。

Conclusion: 随机方法在生成自然韵律和可控性方面优于传统方法，为语音合成提供了新方向。

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

### [330] [LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00755)
*Jinhai Hu,Zhongyi Zhang,Cong Sheng Leow,Wang Ling Goh,Yuan Gao*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种电路-算法协同设计框架，用于可学习的模拟前端（AFE）在音频信号分类中的应用，通过联合优化后端分类器和AFE的传递函数实现系统级优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将AFE和后端分类器分开设计存在不足，论文旨在通过联合优化提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于信噪比（SNR）感知的训练循环，优化模拟带通滤波器（BPF）组的传递函数参数，并使用协同设计损失函数LBPF。

Result: 在SKY130 130nm CMOS工艺中实现，优化设计在5 dB至20 dB的输入信号SNR范围内，10关键词分类任务准确率达90.5%-94.2%，功耗和电容面积分别减少8.7%和12.9%。

Conclusion: 电路-算法协同设计显著提升了音频AFE的性能和效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.
Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and
12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.

*Gunjan Auti,Hirofumi Daiguji,Gouhei Tanaka*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: HPN是一种自组织计算框架，通过局部Hebbian更新学习，无需全局优化，直接编码物理定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖全局优化，限制了可解释性且需外部施加物理约束。

Method: HPN利用守恒定律的违反驱动局部Hebbian更新，通过热力学信号（如连续性、动量或能量的不平衡）实现权重适应。

Result: 在不可压缩流体流动和连续扩散中，HPN从随机初始条件中自发形成物理一致的结构。

Conclusion: HPN将计算重新定义为残差驱动的热力学过程，为复杂动力系统建模提供了可解释、可扩展且物理基础的方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global
optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints
externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing
computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates
driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures,
HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws
directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances
in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive
weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this
approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically
consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without
supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic
process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded
alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.

### [332] [Safe Low Bandwidth SPV: A Formal Treatment of Simplified Payment Verification Protocols and Security Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00740)
*Craig S Wright*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文对比特币白皮书中的简化支付验证（SPV）进行了完整的正式规范、协议描述和数学证明结构，证明其在特定条件下是安全且最优的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清SPV协议的误解，证明其在数字现金系统中的安全性和最优性。

Method: 从基本原理重构SPV协议，使用符号自动机、Merkle成员关系和证明链支配谓词进行验证模型。通过概率和博弈论分析验证其安全性。

Result: 证明了SPV在有限对抗假设下的安全性，并优化了低带宽场景下的性能。

Conclusion: 本文为SPV的安全实现提供了蓝图，并反驳了关于非验证客户端的常见误解。

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding
non-validating clients.

*Ailiya Borjigin,Wei Zhou,Cong He*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合AI治理与区块链的多智能体架构，用于实现可信的替代资产代币化，提升透明度、安全性和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于网络的代币化生态系统中信任问题，如验证链下资产数据和确保监管合规。

Method: 提出AI治理的智能体架构，整合智能体与区块链，实现资产验证、估值、合规检查和生命周期管理。

Result: 通过案例研究（房地产代币化）验证了该架构在风险缓解（如欺诈和洗钱）方面的有效性。

Conclusion: AI治理与多智能体系统及区块链的结合可显著增强代币化资产生态系统的信任，为实践者提供了安全合规的代币化框架。

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial
instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring
trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,
from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This
paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent
agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative
assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the
tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and
lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent
behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic
incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,
and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data
authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets
illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and
money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain
enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance
with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in
tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy
asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to
deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

### [334] [AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145)
*Hasan Yiğit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI-Hybrid TRNG是一种深度学习框架，直接从物理噪声中提取近乎均匀的熵，无需量子设备或昂贵的射频接收器。它使用低成本射频前端和CPU时序抖动生成高熵随机数，并通过NIST测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机数生成器依赖专用硬件，成本高且体积大。AI-Hybrid TRNG旨在通过深度学习框架，利用低成本硬件生成高质量随机数。

Method: 结合动态内外网络，利用自适应自然源和重新播种技术，生成不可预测的随机序列。无需量化步骤，直接输出32位高熵流。

Result: 生成的随机数通过NIST SP 800-22测试和19项定制统计测试，满足加密标准，无预测偏差。模型体积小（<0.5 MB），适用于资源受限平台。

Conclusion: AI-Hybrid TRNG通过摆脱专用硬件限制，扩展了高质量随机数生成器的应用范围，适用于安全系统、加密协议、嵌入式设备等。

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform
entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum
devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a
low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

### [335] [BadViM: Backdoor Attack against Vision Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00577)
*Yinghao Wu,Liyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vision Mamba（ViM）对后门攻击的脆弱性，提出了针对ViM的后门攻击框架BadViM，利用共振频率触发器和隐藏状态对齐损失实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新型视觉状态空间模型（如ViM）的安全隐患，尤其是后门攻击的脆弱性，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出BadViM框架，采用共振频率触发器（RFT）和隐藏状态对齐损失，攻击ViM模型。

Result: BadViM攻击成功率高且不影响干净数据准确性，对常见防御措施（如PatchDrop、JPEG压缩）表现出强抵抗力。

Conclusion: ViM对后门攻击易受攻击，BadViM为研究此类模型安全性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

*Wenjin Mo,Zhiyuan Li,Minghong Fang,Mingwei Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FedPoisonMIA，一种针对联邦学习的投毒成员推理攻击，并提出了一种防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）因其隐私保护特性被广泛采用，但其分布式特性易受投毒攻击，现有攻击多关注模型完整性而非隐私。

Method: 提出FedPoisonMIA攻击，恶意客户端通过本地模型更新推断成员信息；同时设计防御机制减轻攻击影响。

Result: 实验证明攻击有效，防御机制能显著降低其影响。

Conclusion: FedPoisonMIA揭示了FL中的隐私风险，提出的防御机制为实际应用提供了保护。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without
needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the
era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to
adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning
attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data
to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade
the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to
privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA,
a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA
involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership
information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate
the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various
datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach
reduces its impact to a degree.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造和克隆声音等AI生成内容的威胁日益复杂，传统的信任机制已不足以应对，需要新的安全思维来保护组织免受此类攻击。

Method: 结合了带外验证、视觉语言模型（VLMs）作为法证工具、加密来源和人类训练等关键概念，扩展零信任原则至感官信息。

Result: 通过实证研究和学术支持，提出了一种系统验证感官信息的框架，强调在AI生成现实的时代，感官信息需经过严格验证。

Conclusion: 呼吁领导者培养方法论怀疑文化，以保护组织在这一新威胁环境中的完整性。

Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated
attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero
Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to
systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing
rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on
generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band
verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators,
cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework
that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach
is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an
era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be
implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture
of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new
threat landscape.

cluster power usage for three hours during peak grid events while maintaining
AI quality of service (QoS) guarantees. By orchestrating AI workloads based on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具检索方法主要优化工具表示，而忽略了查询理解的精确性，MassTool旨在填补这一空白。

Method: MassTool采用双塔架构，包括工具使用检测塔和工具检索塔，结合QC-GCN、SUIM和AdaKT模块，优化多任务学习。

Result: 实验证明MassTool显著提高了检索准确性。

Conclusion: MassTool通过双塔架构和多任务优化，实现了更精确的查询理解和工具检索。

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了25年来群组推荐系统的研究现状，指出尽管算法丰富，但实际应用稀少，呼吁结合现代生成式AI（如ChatGPT）重新设计系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群组推荐系统的实际应用不足，质疑学术假设与用户需求的匹配度，提出结合AI改进系统设计。

Method: 提出利用生成式AI助手（如ChatGPT）构建交互式群组推荐代理，辅助决策过程。

Result: 指出现有系统设计可能不符合用户需求，AI交互式设计有望提升实际应用。

Conclusion: 呼吁群组推荐系统研究转向AI辅助的自然决策环境，以促进实际应用。

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design
a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of
individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were
published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate
them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite
the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group
recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in
academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group
and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue
that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not
match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in
this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI
assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we
envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members
interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the
decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a
more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of
group recommendation systems in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估自主网页代理的基准测试存在动态内容或过度简化的问题，导致评估不稳定。

Method: 提出WebArXiv基准测试，包含275个基于arXiv平台的任务，使用固定网页快照和确定性真值。同时提出动态反射机制以解决代理过度依赖固定交互历史的问题。

Result: 评估了10种先进网页代理，结果显示性能差异明显，且提出的反射策略有效。

Conclusion: WebArXiv为自主网页代理提供了可重复且可靠的评估基准，动态反射机制提升了代理性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development
of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real
websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the
instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on
dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce
WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks
grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable
evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground
truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we
identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents
over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a
lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively
retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten
state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance
differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed
reflection strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AutoGraph的框架InSight-R，用于自动化识别人为故障事件（HFE）和评估界面设计风险，解决了传统HRA方法依赖专家判断的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人为可靠性分析（HRA）方法依赖专家判断，存在主观性和可重复性差的问题，且缺乏对界面设计影响的量化评估。

Method: 通过AutoGraph构建界面嵌入知识图（IE-KG），结合行为数据，自动化识别HFE和评估界面风险。

Result: InSight-R提高了HFE识别的客观性和可解释性，支持动态实时评估，为界面设计优化提供了依据。

Conclusion: InSight-R框架为机制驱动的HRA方法提供了新途径，适用于数字化控制环境。

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such
as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error.
While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely
adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure
events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This
reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and
limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches
lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design
contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed
human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven
by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the
interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated
graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables
automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated
operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between
designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R
not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification
but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human
reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework
offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to
the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

Motivation: 政治极化阻碍民主公民教育，AI技术为减少极化提供了新机会。

Method: 结合情感计算和叙事理论，开发AI-DCS平台，实时跟踪用户情感和注意力，通过GPT-4个性化叙事内容。

Result: 平台通过情感适应性叙事促进学生对不同政治观点的理解。

Conclusion: AI-DCS为减少极化提供了情感敏感的解决方案，并对公民教育和HCI领域有重要启示。

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating
identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies
offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and
promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that
leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain
students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote
perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories
from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective
computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation
into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the
storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively
developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS)
platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention
tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time.
Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with
beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing
linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that
center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a
foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address
affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with
implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI
challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning
environments.

Result: 发现用户平衡隐私、效率和情感代理的实践，提出如设备端处理、敏感内容屏蔽等设计偏好。

Conclusion: 提出支持用户中心视觉隐私的设计建议，扩展隐私概念及他人数据的负责任处理。

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to
interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can
enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user
independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In
this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences
of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21
participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that
balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for
privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation,
indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional
content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device
processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction,
privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored
interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to
support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of
privacy and responsible handling of others data.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种射击可视化系统，结合第一人称视频和图形化数据，用于提升射击训练效果，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前射击训练主要依赖重复练习和事后分析，缺乏实时反馈和直观可视化工具，限制了训练效果。

Method: 开发了五种复合可视化视图，结合第一人称射击视频和覆盖的指标，通过混合方法研究（包括任务测试、偏好比较和访谈）评估其效果。

Result: 仪表盘式复合视图（结合原始视频、极坐标图和选定图表）在10名参与者中9人偏好，且适用于不同技能水平的射手。

Conclusion: 研究表明，第一人称视频与可视化分析的结合对射击训练有显著价值，并可推广到其他精确性运动中。

Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police,
military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic
shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and
coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through
the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy
post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and
evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To
achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person
shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical
summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen,
5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming
interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured
interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining
raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases
and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this
design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with
visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this
approach to other precision-based sports.

Method: 基于2024年美国总统选举期间2100万条X平台互动，构建了1186个真实用户的LLM代理，在零样本和少样本条件下测试其回复行为。

Result: 发现更丰富的上下文提高了内部一致性，但也加剧了极化、风格化信号和有害语言。

Conclusion: LLMs的输出更多反映其内部优化而非用户行为，挑战了其在内容审核和政策建模中的应用。

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating
political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X
during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on
1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under
controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological
cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one
comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,
Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and
toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency
but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We
observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a
systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our
analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their
outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed
behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as
social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative
simulations, and policy modeling.

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法支持用户指导下的迭代风格细化，具备多步交互能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为TTS系统提供了更灵活的语音风格调整功能，提升了用户体验。

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音转换需要源和目标说话者的音频输入，但在无声视频或嘈杂环境中无法实现。SFVC旨在仅通过视觉输入完成语音转换。

Method: 提出MuteSwap框架，利用对比学习对齐跨模态身份，并通过最小化互信息分离共享视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明，MuteSwap在语音合成和身份转换方面表现优异，尤其在嘈杂环境下优于依赖音频输入的方法。

Conclusion: MuteSwap证明了SFVC的可行性，并展示了其训练方法的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列模型（如LSTM、Mamba）在语音增强中易过拟合，且未探索Mamba与时频注意力结合的泛化性能。

Method: 提出MambAttention架构，结合Mamba和共享时频多头注意力模块，并引入更具挑战性的数据集VB-DemandEx进行训练。

Result: MambAttention在域外数据集DNS 2020和EARS-WHAM_v2上显著优于现有方法，同时在域内数据集VB-DemandEx上表现相当。

Conclusion: MambAttention在泛化性能上优于其他模型，共享时频注意力模块是关键因素。

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and

notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法为难以获取真实数据的成像应用提供了一种实用的学习策略。

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of
reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns.
Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical
phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth
datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping
operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style
transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit
style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate
domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping
operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of
intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by
reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells,
highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework
that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented
method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where
ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

*Nathaël Da Costa,Bálint Mucsányi,Philipp Hennig*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: 论文研究了几何高斯近似的表达能力，包括通过微分同胚或黎曼指数映射的高斯推近，证明了其通用性，并探讨了统一微分同胚的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近似复杂概率分布（如贝叶斯后验分布）是许多应用中的核心问题，研究几何高斯近似的表达能力具有重要意义。

Method: 回顾了两种几何高斯近似方法（微分同胚和黎曼指数映射），探讨了它们的关系，并构造性证明了其通用性。

Result: 证明了几何高斯近似可以捕获任何概率分布，并讨论了统一微分同胚的可能性。

Conclusion: 几何高斯近似具有通用性，但在特定分布族中寻找统一微分同胚仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior
distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the
expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of
approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian
exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric
Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We
further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian
approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability
distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability
distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly
high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.

*Sun Ding,Ude Enebeli,Atilhan,Manay,Ryan Pua,Kamal Kotak*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VTS-AI结合视觉思维策略与AI，从非结构化报告中提取商业洞察，速度快且结果丰富。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代企业处理非结构化报告效率低、缺乏敏捷性的问题。

Method: 采用三层架构（微观、中观、宏观），标注问题并链接到源页面，生成可搜索的YAML文件。

Result: 在测试中，VTS-AI速度与ChatGPT相当，但提供更丰富的发现（如页面位置、因果链接等）。

Conclusion: VTS-AI有望成为生产就绪、审计友好的快速商业分析工具，未来将扩展功能。

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these
documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when
quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual
Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and
thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from
unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers
(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the
same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots
the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed.
Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding
finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a
Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business
analysis.

*Abanoub E. Abdelmalak,Mohamed A. Elsayed,David Abercrombie,Ilhami Torunoglu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合AST嵌入和RAG的新方法，用于提升SVRF代码合成的准确性和效率，在740条DRC规则测试中实现了40%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着半导体节点进步，传统SVRF开发方法因复杂设计规则而失效，且存在专业知识缺口，亟需新方法提升代码生成质量。

Method: 采用AST嵌入进行结构验证，结合RAG注入领域知识，提出SVRF专用评分框架，优化代码生成流程。

Result: 在740条DRC规则测试中，代码生成准确性提升40%，显著减少人工纠错，提高生产效率。

Conclusion: 该方法融合行业知识与先进编码策略，优化了SVRF开发流程，提升了设计迭代速度和整体生产力。

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

### [360] [iPanda: An Intelligent Protocol Testing and Debugging Agent for Conformance Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00378)
*Xikai Sun,Fan Dang,Kebin Liu,Xin Miao,Zihao Yang,Haimo Lu,Yawen Zheng,Yunhao Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: iPanda是一个利用大语言模型（LLMs）自动化协议一致性测试的端到端框架，显著提高了测试代码生成的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统协议一致性测试方法依赖人工创建大量测试用例和脚本，效率低下且耗时。LLMs的文本理解和代码生成能力为自动化提供了新机会。

Method: iPanda通过关键词方法生成测试用例，采用基于代码的检索增强生成技术生成可执行测试代码，并通过迭代自校正机制优化代码质量。

Result: 实验表明，iPanda在测试代码生成的成功率（Pass@1）上比纯LLM方法提高了4.675至10.751倍。

Conclusion: iPanda框架为协议一致性测试提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

TL;DR: 研究探讨AI助手对代码可维护性的影响，发现AI辅助开发能小幅提升后续开发速度和代码健康度，但整体差异不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI助手（如GitHub Copilot）在软件开发中广泛应用，但其对代码可维护性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 两阶段实验：第一阶段开发者使用或不使用AI助手添加功能；第二阶段其他开发者维护这些代码。

Result: AI辅助开发小幅提升后续开发速度（30.7%中位数减少）和代码健康度（对习惯性用户显著）。

Conclusion: AI助手能加速开发且未损害可维护性，未来需关注代码膨胀和认知债务风险。

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

### [362] [Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269)
*Omar Claflin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 当前稀疏自编码器（SAE）方法假设激活可以通过线性叠加分解为稀疏、可解释的特征，但未能消除多义性并存在行为错误。论文提出神经网络的编码包含特征身份和特征整合两个互补空间，并通过联合训练架构验证了这一假设，显著提升了重建效果和减少了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAE在多义性和行为错误上的局限性，验证神经网络中特征身份与特征整合的双重编码假设。

Method: 开发了顺序和联合训练架构，同时捕捉身份和整合模式，并通过非线性组件高效捕获计算关系。

Result: 联合训练实现了41.3%的重建改进和51.6%的KL散度误差减少，非线性组件独立提升了16.5%。干预实验显示整合特征对实验操作敏感并影响模型输出。

Conclusion: 论文证明了神经网络中的双重编码、非线性特征交互的重要性，并提出了从后验特征分析转向集成计算设计的架构范式转变。

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.
