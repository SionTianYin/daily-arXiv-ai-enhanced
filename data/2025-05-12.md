### [1] [KG-HTC: Integrating Knowledge Graphs into LLMs for Effective Zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05583)
*Qianbo Zang,Christophe Zgrzendek,Igor Tchappi,Afshin Khadangi,Johannes Sedlmeir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合知识图谱和大语言模型（LLMs）的零样本分层文本分类方法（KG-HTC），解决了传统监督方法在标注数据不足、标签空间大和长尾分布等问题上的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，分层文本分类（HTC）常因缺乏标注数据而难以应用监督方法，且面临大标签空间和长尾分布问题。

Method: 通过检索增强生成（RAG）从知识图谱中提取相关子图，结合LLMs理解标签语义。

Result: 在三个开源数据集（WoS、DBpedia、Amazon）上，KG-HTC在零样本设置下显著优于基线方法，尤其在深层分类上表现突出。

Conclusion: KG-HTC证明了结构化知识对解决HTC问题的有效性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) involves assigning documents to labels
organized within a taxonomy. Most previous research on HTC has focused on
supervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC
can be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces
issues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we
present Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification
(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by
integrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide
structured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves
relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to
understand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on
three open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental
results show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the
strict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at
deeper levels of the hierarchy. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of incorporating structured knowledge into LLMs to address HTC's challenges in
large label spaces and long-tailed label distributions. Our code is available
at: https://github.com/QianboZang/KG-HTC.

### [2] [Privacy-Preserving Transformers: SwiftKey's Differential Privacy Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05648)
*Abdelrahman Abouelenin,Mohamed Abdelrehim,Raffy Fahim,Amr Hendy,Mohamed Afify*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用差分隐私（DP）训练Transformer进行语言建模，通过缩小GPT2架构和两阶段训练，在SwiftKey中实现更优的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在SwiftKey中平衡模型大小、运行速度和准确性，同时保护用户隐私。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在通用数据上训练种子模型，再用DP微调打字数据；缩小GPT2架构以适应需求。

Result: 在下一词预测和准确性上取得小幅但一致的提升，同时内存和速度增加可控。

Conclusion: Transformer通过ONNX集成，提供了灵活性和效率，优于现有GRU模型。

Abstract: In this paper we train a transformer using differential privacy (DP) for
language modeling in SwiftKey. We run multiple experiments to balance the
trade-off between the model size, run-time speed and accuracy. We show that we
get small and consistent gains in the next-word-prediction and accuracy with
graceful increase in memory and speed compared to the production GRU. This is
obtained by scaling down a GPT2 architecture to fit the required size and a two
stage training process that builds a seed model on general data and DP
finetunes it on typing data. The transformer is integrated using ONNX offering
both flexibility and efficiency.

### [3] [Exploration of COVID-19 Discourse on Twitter: American Politician Edition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05687)
*Cindy Kim,Daniela Puchall,Jiangyi Liang,Jiwon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了美国两党（共和党和民主党）在COVID-19疫情中的推特言论差异，发现民主党更关注疫情伤亡和医疗建议，而共和党更注重政治责任和媒体更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨COVID-19疫情如何影响美国两党的言论和态度，揭示党派差异。

Method: 使用词袋模型、双词模型和TF-IDF模型分析推特关键词、主题和情感。

Result: 民主党更关注疫情伤亡和医疗建议，共和党更注重政治责任和媒体更新。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于分类算法的系统性方法，预测推文的政治立场。

Abstract: The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly affected the political
scene worldwide and the introduction of new terminology and public opinions
regarding the virus has further polarized partisan stances. Using a collection
of tweets gathered from leading American political figures online (Republican
and Democratic), we explored the partisan differences in approach, response,
and attitude towards handling the international crisis. Implementation of the
bag-of-words, bigram, and TF-IDF models was used to identify and analyze
keywords, topics, and overall sentiments from each party. Results suggest that
Democrats are more concerned with the casualties of the pandemic, and give more
medical precautions and recommendations to the public whereas Republicans are
more invested in political responsibilities such as keeping the public updated
through media and carefully watching the progress of the virus. We propose a
systematic approach to predict and distinguish a tweet's political stance (left
or right leaning) based on its COVID-19 related terms using different
classification algorithms on different language models.

### [4] [Assessing Robustness to Spurious Correlations in Post-Training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05704)
*Julia Shuieh,Prasann Singhal,Apaar Shanker,John Heyer,George Pu,Samuel Denton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了三种后训练算法（SFT、DPO、KTO）在不同任务和虚假相关性条件下的表现，发现不同算法在不同任务和条件下表现各异，需根据任务类型和虚假相关性选择最佳策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究虚假相关性对大型语言模型性能的影响，并比较不同后训练算法在应对这些相关性时的表现。

Method: 在数学推理、指令遵循和文档问答等任务中，测试SFT、DPO和KTO算法在不同虚假相关性条件下的表现。

Result: 偏好优化方法（DPO/KTO）在数学推理任务中表现稳健，而SFT在复杂任务中表现更优。虚假相关性高时模型性能普遍下降。

Conclusion: 没有一种后训练算法在所有场景中表现最佳，选择需基于任务类型和虚假相关性特点。

Abstract: Supervised and preference-based fine-tuning techniques have become popular
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent and correctness
criteria. However, real-world training data often exhibits spurious
correlations -- arising from biases, dataset artifacts, or other "shortcut"
features -- that can compromise a model's performance or generalization. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate three post-training algorithms --
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and KTO
(Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) -- across a diverse set of synthetic tasks and
spuriousness conditions. Our tasks span mathematical reasoning, constrained
instruction-following, and document-grounded question answering. We vary the
degree of spurious correlation (10% vs. 90%) and investigate two forms of
artifacts: "Feature Ambiguity" and "Distributional Narrowness." Our results
show that the models often but not always degrade under higher spuriousness.
The preference-based methods (DPO/KTO) can demonstrate relative robustness in
mathematical reasoning tasks. By contrast, SFT maintains stronger performance
in complex, context-intensive tasks. These findings highlight that no single
post-training strategy universally outperforms in all scenarios; the best
choice depends on the type of target task and the nature of spurious
correlations.

### [5] [TopicVD: A Topic-Based Dataset of Video-Guided Multimodal Machine Translation for Documentaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05714)
*Jinze Lv,Jian Chen,Zi Long,Xianghua Fu,Yin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了TopicVD数据集，支持视频多模态机器翻译（MMT），并验证了视觉信息和全局上下文对翻译性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT数据集多为静态图像或短视频，无法满足纪录片翻译等实际需求，因此开发了TopicVD数据集。

Method: 收集纪录片视频-字幕对，按主题分类，提出基于跨模态双向注意力模块的MMT模型。

Result: 视觉信息提升翻译性能，但跨领域性能下降；全局上下文能有效改善翻译。

Conclusion: TopicVD推动了视频MMT研究，需进一步解决领域适应问题。

Abstract: Most existing multimodal machine translation (MMT) datasets are predominantly
composed of static images or short video clips, lacking extensive video data
across diverse domains and topics. As a result, they fail to meet the demands
of real-world MMT tasks, such as documentary translation. In this study, we
developed TopicVD, a topic-based dataset for video-supported multimodal machine
translation of documentaries, aiming to advance research in this field. We
collected video-subtitle pairs from documentaries and categorized them into
eight topics, such as economy and nature, to facilitate research on domain
adaptation in video-guided MMT. Additionally, we preserved their contextual
information to support research on leveraging the global context of
documentaries in video-guided MMT. To better capture the shared semantics
between text and video, we propose an MMT model based on a cross-modal
bidirectional attention module. Extensive experiments on the TopicVD dataset
demonstrate that visual information consistently improves the performance of
the NMT model in documentary translation. However, the MMT model's performance
significantly declines in out-of-domain scenarios, highlighting the need for
effective domain adaptation methods. Additionally, experiments demonstrate that
global context can effectively improve translation performance. % Dataset and
our implementations are available at https://github.com/JinzeLv/TopicVD

### [6] [Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755)
*Dhruvesh Patel,Aishwarya Sahoo,Avinash Amballa,Tahira Naseem,Tim G. J. Rudner,Andrew McCallum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 插入语言模型（ILMs）通过任意位置插入令牌解决了自回归模型（ARMs）和掩码扩散模型（MDMs）的局限性，在规划任务中表现更优，并在文本生成任务中与ARMs相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARMs和MDMs在处理复杂约束或非顺序依赖的序列时存在不足，需要一种更灵活的生成方法。

Method: 提出插入语言模型（ILMs），通过联合选择插入位置和词汇元素，并采用去噪目标训练。

Result: ILMs在规划任务中优于ARMs和MDMs，在文本生成任务中与ARMs相当，且在任意长度文本填充中更灵活。

Conclusion: ILMs提供了一种更灵活的序列生成方法，适用于复杂约束和非顺序依赖的场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one
``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range
of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent
sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential
dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion
Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking
multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs
cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be
filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion
Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in
a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary
element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent
strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in
arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token
dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs,
we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising
objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs
and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform
MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task
while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text
infilling.

### [7] [Sparse Attention Remapping with Clustering for Efficient LLM Decoding on PIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05772)
*Zehao Fan,Garrett Gagnon,Zhenyu Liu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STARC是一种针对PIM架构优化的稀疏数据映射方案，通过语义聚类KV对并映射到连续内存区域，显著降低LLM解码的延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在自回归解码时因KV缓存的内存访问压力成为瓶颈，现有PIM架构难以处理动态稀疏访问模式。

Method: STARC通过语义聚类KV对并映射到连续内存区域，利用预计算中心点实现选择性注意和并行处理。

Result: 实验表明，STARC在HBM-PIM系统上降低注意力层延迟19%-31%，能耗19%-27%，并在KV缓存预算下进一步优化。

Conclusion: STARC在保持模型精度的同时，显著提升了PIM架构上长上下文LLM推理的效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but
their execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language
models (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent
memory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in
memory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory
(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth
and compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily
optimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access
patterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they
suffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.
In this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme
tailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC
clusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory
regions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve
relevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed
centroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without
frequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM
system show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces
attention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a
KV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and
45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC
maintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and
hardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.

*Machi Shimmei,Masaki Uto,Yuichiroh Matsubayashi,Kentaro Inui,Aditi Mallavarapu,Noboru Matsuda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AnaQuest是一种创新的提示技术，用于通过预训练的大语言模型生成多选题（MCQs），结合形成性和总结性评估，生成的题目在难度和区分度上更接近人工题目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能生成高质量多选题的技术，以提升自动化评估的效果，并验证其与人工题目的可比性。

Method: AnaQuest通过分析学生的开放回答生成正确和错误的断言，利用Item Response Theory（IRT）评估生成题目的有效性。

Result: 专家评价AnaQuest和ChatGPT生成的题目与人工题目同样有效，但AnaQuest的题目在难度和区分度上更接近人工题目。

Conclusion: AnaQuest在生成多选题方面表现出色，尤其在错误选项的设计上优于ChatGPT，接近人工水平。

Abstract: The primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an innovative
prompting technique, AnaQuest, for generating multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
using a pre-trained large language model. In AnaQuest, the choice items are
sentence-level assertions about complex concepts. The technique integrates
formative and summative assessments. In the formative phase, students answer
open-ended questions for target concepts in free text. For summative
assessment, AnaQuest analyzes these responses to generate both correct and
incorrect assertions. To evaluate the validity of the generated MCQs, Item
Response Theory (IRT) was applied to compare item characteristics between MCQs
generated by AnaQuest, a baseline ChatGPT prompt, and human-crafted items. An
empirical study found that expert instructors rated MCQs generated by both AI
models to be as valid as those created by human instructors. However, IRT-based
analysis revealed that AnaQuest-generated questions - particularly those with
incorrect assertions (foils) - more closely resembled human-crafted items in
terms of difficulty and discrimination than those produced by ChatGPT.

### [9] [Symbol-based entity marker highlighting for enhanced text mining in materials science with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05864)
*Junhyeong Lee,Jong Min Yuk,Chan-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合文本挖掘框架，结合多步和直接方法的优势，将非结构化科学文本转化为结构化数据，并通过实体标记技术显著提升实体识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（多步和直接方法）在独立应用时存在局限性，需要一种更高效的方法来从科学文献中提取结构化数据。

Method: 提出混合框架，先将原始文本转化为实体识别文本，再转化为结构化数据，并引入实体标记技术提升识别性能。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，实体识别性能显著优于现有方法，实体级F1分数提升58%，关系级F1分数提升83%。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了多步和直接方法的优势，显著提升了从科学文本中提取结构化数据的效率和质量。

Abstract: The construction of experimental datasets is essential for expanding the
scope of data-driven scientific discovery. Recent advances in natural language
processing (NLP) have facilitated automatic extraction of structured data from
unstructured scientific literature. While existing approaches-multi-step and
direct methods-offer valuable capabilities, they also come with limitations
when applied independently. Here, we propose a novel hybrid text-mining
framework that integrates the advantages of both methods to convert
unstructured scientific text into structured data. Our approach first
transforms raw text into entity-recognized text, and subsequently into
structured form. Furthermore, beyond the overall data structuring framework, we
also enhance entity recognition performance by introducing an entity marker-a
simple yet effective technique that uses symbolic annotations to highlight
target entities. Specifically, our entity marker-based hybrid approach not only
consistently outperforms previous entity recognition approaches across three
benchmark datasets (MatScholar, SOFC, and SOFC slot NER) but also improve the
quality of final structured data-yielding up to a 58% improvement in
entity-level F1 score and up to 83% improvement in relation-level F1 score
compared to direct approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 实验研究了在Gemma2 20亿参数大语言模型（LLM）上使用弹性权重巩固（EWC）进行自回归预训练，以缓解灾难性遗忘并提升新任务学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EWC在LLM持续学习中的应用，特别是在多语言环境下（如立陶宛语）的效果。

Method: 在CulturaX数据集的立陶宛语部分（10%）上应用EWC，评估语言理解和困惑度基准。

Result: EWC不仅缓解了灾难性遗忘，还可能对新任务学习有益。

Conclusion: EWC在LLM持续学习中具有潜力，尤其在多语言任务中表现良好。

Abstract: This technical report describes an experiment on autoregressive pre-training
of Gemma2 2 billion parameter large language model (LLM) with 10\% on the
Lithuanian language component of CulturaX from the point of view of continual
learning. We apply elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to the full set of the
model's parameters and investigate language understanding benchmarks,
consisting of Arc, Belebele, Gsm8K, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande
sets (both in English and Lithuanian versions), and perplexity benchmarks. We
empirically demonstrate that EWC regularisation allows us not only to mitigate
catastrophic forgetting effects but also that it is potentially beneficial for
learning of the new task with LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过微调大型语言模型自动生成德国判决书的摘要，并利用法律实体信息提升摘要质量，但实际应用效果仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为法律专家提供自动化工具以简化日常工作中对长法律文档的摘要需求。

Method: 通过微调解码器基础的大型语言模型，并在训练前用法律实体信息丰富判决书内容。

Result: 使用法律实体信息有助于模型找到相关内容，但生成的摘要质量尚未达到实际应用标准。

Conclusion: 尽管法律实体信息对模型有帮助，但当前生成的摘要质量仍需进一步改进才能用于实践。

Abstract: The automated summarisation of long legal documents can be a great aid for
legal experts in their daily work. We automatically create summaries (guiding
principles) of German judgments by fine-tuning a decoder-based large language
model. We enrich the judgments with information about legal entities before the
training. For the evaluation of the created summaries, we define a set of
evaluation classes which allows us to measure their language, pertinence,
completeness and correctness. Our results show that employing legal entities
helps the generative model to find the relevant content, but the quality of the
created summaries is not yet sufficient for a use in practice.

### [12] [NeoQA: Evidence-based Question Answering with Generated News Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05949)
*Max Glockner,Xiang Jiang,Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro,Iryna Gurevych,Markus Dreyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeoQA是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成（RAG）中的表现，通过虚构新闻事件和实体确保模型无法依赖预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试容易过时，难以区分模型是基于检索证据还是预训练知识回答问题。

Method: 构建虚构新闻事件的时间线和知识库，生成问答对，确保模型仅依赖检索证据回答问题。

Result: LLMs在问题和证据间细微不匹配时表现不佳，且在关键信息缺失时容易走捷径推理。

Conclusion: NeoQA揭示了LLMs在基于证据推理中的关键局限性，为未来研究提供了新平台。

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in large language models
(LLMs) is challenging because benchmarks can quickly become stale. Questions
initially requiring retrieval may become answerable from pretraining knowledge
as newer models incorporate more recent information during pretraining, making
it difficult to distinguish evidence-based reasoning from recall. We introduce
NeoQA (News Events for Out-of-training Question Answering), a benchmark
designed to address this issue. To construct NeoQA, we generated timelines and
knowledge bases of fictional news events and entities along with news articles
and Q\&A pairs to prevent LLMs from leveraging pretraining knowledge, ensuring
that no prior evidence exists in their training data. We propose our dataset as
a new platform for evaluating evidence-based question answering, as it requires
LLMs to generate responses exclusively from retrieved evidence and only when
sufficient evidence is available. NeoQA enables controlled evaluation across
various evidence scenarios, including cases with missing or misleading details.
Our findings indicate that LLMs struggle to distinguish subtle mismatches
between questions and evidence, and suffer from short-cut reasoning when key
information required to answer a question is missing from the evidence,
underscoring key limitations in evidence-based reasoning.

*Lennart Stöpler,Rufat Asadli,Mitja Nikolaus,Ryan Cotterell,Alex Warstadt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交互式语言学习的训练方法，模拟儿童语言习得过程，通过单轮对话中的奖励机制优化语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受儿童语言习得启发，探索交互式学习对语言模型训练的潜在益处。

Method: 在抽象的语言问答环境中定义沟通成功，并通过强化学习微调语言模型。

Result: 实验表明沟通奖励间接反映语法性，但当前训练方法未显著提升语言评估表现。

Conclusion: 未来可通过改进任务设计和训练配置，进一步验证交互学习对语言模型的益处。

Abstract: We propose a method for training language models in an interactive setting
inspired by child language acquisition. In our setting, a speaker attempts to
communicate some information to a listener in a single-turn dialogue and
receives a reward if communicative success is achieved. Unlike earlier related
work using image--caption data for interactive reference games, we
operationalize communicative success in a more abstract language-only
question--answering setting. First, we present a feasibility study
demonstrating that our reward provides an indirect signal about grammaticality.
Second, we conduct experiments using reinforcement learning to fine-tune
language models. We observe that cognitively plausible constraints on the
communication channel lead to interpretable changes in speaker behavior.
However, we do not yet see improvements on linguistic evaluations from our
training regime. We outline potential modifications to the task design and
training configuration that could better position future work to use our
methodology to observe the benefits of interaction on language learning in
computational cognitive models.

*M. Maziyah Mohamed,R. H. Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了语义透明度的嵌入测量方法及其对阅读的影响，通过聚类分析和线性判别分析验证了这些方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义透明度在词汇识别中起关键作用，但其计算操作化仍待探讨。

Method: 采用t-SNE聚类分析马来语前缀词，并通过线性判别分析和广义加性混合模型评估嵌入测量方法。

Result: 所有测量方法均能预测词汇决策延迟，其中与聚类中心的相关系数表现最佳。

Conclusion: 嵌入测量方法能有效量化语义透明度，并显著影响词汇识别过程。

Abstract: Studies of morphological processing have shown that semantic transparency is
crucial for word recognition. Its computational operationalization is still
under discussion. Our primary objectives are to explore embedding-based
measures of semantic transparency, and assess their impact on reading. First,
we explored the geometry of complex words in semantic space. To do so, we
conducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on
4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words
varied by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and
investigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision
latencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the
prefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors
(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The
accuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the
degree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by
comparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same
prefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,
and between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations
of Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model. In a series of Generalized
Additive Mixed Models, all measures predicted decision latencies after
accounting for word frequency, word length, and morphological family size. The
model that included the correlation between each word and their centroid as a
predictor provided the best fit to the data.

Abstract: Recent language models can successfully solve various language-related tasks,
and many understand inputs stated in different languages. In this paper, we
explore the performance of 17 popular models used to correct grammatical issues
in texts stated in English, German, Italian, and Swedish when using a single
model to correct texts in all those languages. We analyze the outputs generated
by these models, focusing on decreasing the number of grammatical errors while
keeping the changes small. The conclusions drawn help us understand what
problems occur among those models and which models can be recommended for
multilingual grammatical error correction tasks. We list six models that
improve grammatical correctness in all four languages and show that Gemma 9B is
currently the best performing one for the languages considered.

Abstract: Current machine translation models provide us with high-quality outputs in
most scenarios. However, they still face some specific problems, such as
detecting which entities should not be changed during translation. In this
paper, we explore the abilities of popular NMT models, including models from
the OPUS project, Google Translate, MADLAD, and EuroLLM, to preserve entities
such as URL addresses, IBAN numbers, or emails when producing translations
between four languages: English, German, Polish, and Ukrainian. We investigate
the quality of popular NMT models in terms of accuracy, discuss errors made by
the models, and examine the reasons for errors. Our analysis highlights
specific categories, such as emojis, that pose significant challenges for many
models considered. In addition to the analysis, we propose a new multilingual
synthetic dataset of 36,000 sentences that can help assess the quality of
entity transfer across nine categories and four aforementioned languages.

TL;DR: Unilogit是一种新型自蒸馏方法，用于大语言模型中的机器遗忘，动态调整目标logits以实现选择性遗忘，同时保持模型整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在遵守GDPR等数据隐私法规时，选择性遗忘特定信息同时保持模型效用的挑战。

Method: 动态调整目标logits，利用当前模型输出生成更准确的自蒸馏目标，避免额外超参数。

Result: 在公共基准和内部电商数据集上表现优异，优于NPO和UnDIAL等方法，平衡遗忘与保留目标。

Conclusion: Unilogit在多种场景下表现出鲁棒性，实际应用性强，是机器遗忘的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces Unilogit, a novel self-distillation method for machine
unlearning in Large Language Models. Unilogit addresses the challenge of
selectively forgetting specific information while maintaining overall model
utility, a critical task in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.
Unlike prior methods that rely on static hyperparameters or starting model
outputs, Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform
probability for the target token, leveraging the current model's outputs for
more accurate self-distillation targets. This approach not only eliminates the
need for additional hyperparameters but also enhances the model's ability to
approximate the golden targets. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and
an in-house e-commerce dataset demonstrate Unilogit's superior performance in
balancing forget and retain objectives, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
such as NPO and UnDIAL. Our analysis further reveals Unilogit's robustness
across various scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability and
effectiveness in achieving efficacious machine unlearning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PubHealthBench，一个评估LLMs在公共健康领域知识的新基准，包含8000多个问题。研究发现，最新的私有LLMs在MCQA中表现优异（>90%），但在自由回答中表现较差（<75%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，了解其在特定领域（如公共健康）的知识准确性变得至关重要，尤其是在可能影响公众健康的情况下。

Method: 通过自动化流程创建PubHealthBench，包含MCQA和自由回答测试，评估24个LLMs的表现。

Result: 最新私有LLMs在MCQA中表现优异（>90%），但在自由回答中表现较差（<75%），且优于仅使用搜索引擎的人类。

Conclusion: 尽管SOTA LLMs在公共健康信息方面表现良好，但在自由回答中仍需额外保障措施。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed
understanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for
successful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health,
where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could
significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM
knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue,
this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions
for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form
responses to public health queries, created via an automated pipeline. We also
release a new dataset of the extracted UK Government public health guidance
documents used as source text for PubHealthBench. Assessing 24 LLMs on
PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a
high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% in the MCQA setup, and outperform
humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see
lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Therefore, whilst there are
promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate
source of public health information, additional safeguards or tools may still
be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.

*Iuliia Zaitova,Vitalii Hirak,Badr M. Abdullah,Dietrich Klakow,Bernd Möbius,Tania Avgustinova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了基于BERT架构的编码器模型对多词表达（MWEs）的注意力模式，发现微调任务类型显著影响模型对MWEs的关注方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨微调任务（语义与句法）如何影响BERT模型对MWEs（成语与微句法单位）的注意力分配。

Method: 使用六种印欧语言的数据集，比较预训练和微调模型对MWEs的注意力分数。

Result: 语义任务微调模型对成语表达更均匀分配注意力，句法任务微调模型在低层更关注微句法单位。

Conclusion: 微调任务类型显著影响模型对MWEs的注意力分配，语义与句法任务表现出不同的注意力模式。

Abstract: This study analyzes the attention patterns of fine-tuned encoder-only models
based on the BERT architecture (BERT-based models) towards two distinct types
of Multiword Expressions (MWEs): idioms and microsyntactic units (MSUs). Idioms
present challenges in semantic non-compositionality, whereas MSUs demonstrate
unconventional syntactic behavior that does not conform to standard grammatical
categorizations. We aim to understand whether fine-tuning BERT-based models on
specific tasks influences their attention to MWEs, and how this attention
differs between semantic and syntactic tasks. We examine attention scores to
MWEs in both pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT-based models. We utilize
monolingual models and datasets in six Indo-European languages - English,
German, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. Our results show that
fine-tuning significantly influences how models allocate attention to MWEs.
Specifically, models fine-tuned on semantic tasks tend to distribute attention
to idiomatic expressions more evenly across layers. Models fine-tuned on
syntactic tasks show an increase in attention to MSUs in the lower layers,
corresponding with syntactic processing requirements.

Motivation: 探索多模态情感分析中跨模态交互的有效建模方法，验证早期融合策略和Transformer架构的优越性。

Method: 采用BERT编码器分别处理文本、音频和视觉模态，通过早期融合（特征拼接）整合多模态信息，使用Adam优化器（学习率1e-4）、dropout（0.3）和早停策略训练模型。

Result: 模型在测试集上取得97.87%的7分类准确率和0.9682的F1分数，MAE为0.1060，表明其能精确预测情感强度。

Conclusion: 早期融合和Transformer架构在多模态情感分析中表现优异，未来可比较不同融合策略或提升模型可解释性。

Abstract: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI
dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text,
audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality,
extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model
achieves strong performance, with 97.87\% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682
F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in
capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization
(lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and
robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in
modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise
sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or
enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by
effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment
analysis.

*Philippe Laban,Hiroaki Hayashi,Yingbo Zhou,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型（LLMs）在单轮和多轮对话中的性能差异，发现多轮对话中性能显著下降，主要原因是模型在早期假设错误后难以恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在用户指令不明确的多轮对话中的表现，填补现有评估主要关注单轮明确指令的空白。

Method: 通过大规模模拟实验，比较LLMs在单轮和多轮对话中的性能，分析200,000+模拟对话数据。

Result: 多轮对话中LLMs性能平均下降39%，主要由于模型早期假设错误且过度依赖，导致可靠性显著降低。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮对话中表现不佳，需改进模型以更好地处理不明确指令和错误恢复。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are conversational interfaces. As such, LLMs
have the potential to assist their users not only when they can fully specify
the task at hand, but also to help them define, explore, and refine what they
need through multi-turn conversational exchange. Although analysis of LLM
conversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in
user instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,
fully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale
simulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn
settings. Our experiments confirm that all the top open- and closed-weight LLMs
we test exhibit significantly lower performance in multi-turn conversations
than single-turn, with an average drop of 39% across six generation tasks.
Analysis of 200,000+ simulated conversations decomposes the performance
degradation into two components: a minor loss in aptitude and a significant
increase in unreliability. We find that LLMs often make assumptions in early
turns and prematurely attempt to generate final solutions, on which they overly
rely. In simpler terms, we discover that *when LLMs take a wrong turn in a
conversation, they get lost and do not recover*.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化的策略，用于提升基于Transformer的模型在少样本文本分类任务中的性能。实验表明，该方法在FewRel 2.0数据集上表现优异，尤其在5-shot设置下，能更有效地捕捉文本特征并提高分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本文本分类在低资源环境中具有重要应用价值，但现有方法在语义边界模糊或特征分布复杂的类别上表现不佳。

Method: 结合自适应微调、对比学习和正则化优化，引入对比损失和正则化损失以增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在FewRel 2.0数据集上，T5-small、DeBERTa-v3和RoBERTa-base在5-shot任务中表现优异，分类准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: 使用更强的自注意力机制或生成架构的Transformer模型，可以提升少样本分类的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Few-shot text classification has important application value in low-resource
environments. This paper proposes a strategy that combines adaptive
fine-tuning, contrastive learning, and regularization optimization to improve
the classification performance of Transformer-based models. Experiments on the
FewRel 2.0 dataset show that T5-small, DeBERTa-v3, and RoBERTa-base perform
well in few-shot tasks, especially in the 5-shot setting, which can more
effectively capture text features and improve classification accuracy. The
experiment also found that there are significant differences in the
classification difficulty of different relationship categories. Some categories
have fuzzy semantic boundaries or complex feature distributions, making it
difficult for the standard cross entropy loss to learn the discriminative
information required to distinguish categories. By introducing contrastive loss
and regularization loss, the generalization ability of the model is enhanced,
effectively alleviating the overfitting problem in few-shot environments. In
addition, the research results show that the use of Transformer models or
generative architectures with stronger self-attention mechanisms can help
improve the stability and accuracy of few-shot classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了多语言大语言模型（如LLaMA、Aya等）在零样本和少样本提示下检测仇恨言论的效果，发现其虽不及微调编码器模型，但在泛化能力上表现更好，且提示设计对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视语言多样性，多语言大语言模型潜力未充分探索。

Method: 在八种非英语语言中评估LLM的零样本和少样本提示技术，并与微调编码器模型对比。

Result: 零样本和少样本提示在真实数据集上表现较差，但在泛化测试中优于微调模型；提示设计对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 提示设计是关键，需针对不同语言定制提示技术以优化仇恨言论检测性能。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in automated hate speech detection, most existing
approaches overlook the linguistic diversity of online content. Multilingual
instruction-tuned large language models such as LLaMA, Aya, Qwen, and BloomZ
offer promising capabilities across languages, but their effectiveness in
identifying hate speech through zero-shot and few-shot prompting remains
underexplored. This work evaluates LLM prompting-based detection across eight
non-English languages, utilizing several prompting techniques and comparing
them to fine-tuned encoder models. We show that while zero-shot and few-shot
prompting lag behind fine-tuned encoder models on most of the real-world
evaluation sets, they achieve better generalization on functional tests for
hate speech detection. Our study also reveals that prompt design plays a
critical role, with each language often requiring customized prompting
techniques to maximize performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在固定计算预算下微调大语言模型（LLM）的扩展定律，强调了数据组成（如样本数量和平均长度）对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅以总token数衡量训练数据，忽略了数据组成（如样本数量和平均长度）对模型性能的决定性作用。

Method: 通过实验在BRICC和MMLU数据集上验证数据组成对token效率的影响，并调整扩展定律。

Result: 实验表明数据组成显著影响token效率，需要更精细的扩展定律。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限场景下的LLM微调提供了更实用的扩展定律。

Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under
fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition.
Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the
number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset
volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned
following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset
\cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset
\cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple
subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects
token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM
fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NLP的多维度框架，用于客观评估心理咨询中的参与质量，通过特征提取和分类器优化，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户与治疗师之间的参与质量是治疗成功的关键因素，需要一种客观的评估方法。

Method: 使用253份心理咨询文本（150高质量，103低质量），提取42个特征（对话动态、语义相似性、情感分类、问题检测），并优化多种分类器（RF、Cat-Boost、SVM）。

Result: 在增强数据上，RF和SVM表现最佳，RF达到88.9%准确率和94.6% AUC。对话动态和语义相似性是关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架具有扩展性，支持未来多模态评估，为临床提供实时反馈，提升治疗质量。

Abstract: Engagement between client and therapist is a critical determinant of
therapeutic success. We propose a multi-dimensional natural language processing
(NLP) framework that objectively classifies engagement quality in counseling
sessions based on textual transcripts. Using 253 motivational interviewing
transcripts (150 high-quality, 103 low-quality), we extracted 42 features
across four domains: conversational dynamics, semantic similarity as topic
alignment, sentiment classification, and question detection. Classifiers,
including Random Forest (RF), Cat-Boost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM),
were hyperparameter tuned and trained using a stratified 5-fold
cross-validation and evaluated on a holdout test set. On balanced
(non-augmented) data, RF achieved the highest classification accuracy (76.7%),
and SVM achieved the highest AUC (85.4%). After SMOTE-Tomek augmentation,
performance improved significantly: RF achieved up to 88.9% accuracy, 90.0%
F1-score, and 94.6% AUC, while SVM reached 81.1% accuracy, 83.1% F1-score, and
93.6% AUC. The augmented data results reflect the potential of the framework in
future larger-scale applications. Feature contribution revealed conversational
dynamics and semantic similarity between clients and therapists were among the
top contributors, led by words uttered by the client (mean and standard
deviation). The framework was robust across the original and augmented datasets
and demonstrated consistent improvements in F1 scores and recall. While
currently text-based, the framework supports future multimodal extensions
(e.g., vocal tone, facial affect) for more holistic assessments. This work
introduces a scalable, data-driven method for evaluating engagement quality of
the therapy session, offering clinicians real-time feedback to enhance the
quality of both virtual and in-person therapeutic interactions.

Result: URCA在F1分数上比现有方法提升10.3%，但数据集复杂度高。

Conclusion: CochraneForest为自动化证据合成系统提供了挑战性测试平台。

Abstract: Extracting scientific evidence from biomedical studies for clinical research
questions (e.g., Does stem cell transplantation improve quality of life in
patients with medically refractory Crohn's disease compared to placebo?) is a
crucial step in synthesising biomedical evidence. In this paper, we focus on
the task of document-level scientific evidence extraction for clinical
questions with conflicting evidence. To support this task, we create a dataset
called CochraneForest, leveraging forest plots from Cochrane systematic
reviews. It comprises 202 annotated forest plots, associated clinical research
questions, full texts of studies, and study-specific conclusions. Building on
CochraneForest, we propose URCA (Uniform Retrieval Clustered Augmentation), a
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to tackle the unique
challenges of evidence extraction. Our experiments show that URCA outperforms
the best existing methods by up to 10.3% in F1 score on this task. However, the
results also underscore the complexity of CochraneForest, establishing it as a
challenging testbed for advancing automated evidence synthesis systems.

Motivation: 自然驾驶研究产生大量多样化数据，需要自动化处理以提取驾驶员行为特征，尤其是交叉路口的头部扫描行为。

Method: 开发了定制工具标记交叉路口，同步位置和视频数据，并使用AI模型检测驾驶员头部姿态和场景中的交通标志、行人等。结合车辆运动模式推断交叉路口类型和边界。

Result: 处理了190个交叉路口，自动化算法在检测交通标志和机动行为上的准确率分别为100%和94%，交叉路口边界检测的中位重叠率为0.88。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies use devices in participants' own vehicles to
record daily driving over many months. Due to diverse and extensive amounts of
data recorded, automated processing is necessary. This report describes methods
to extract and characterize driver head scans at intersections from data
collected from an in-car recording system that logged vehicle speed, GPS
location, scene videos, and cabin videos. Custom tools were developed to mark
the intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and
scene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location. A
custom-developed head pose detection AI model for wide angle head turns was run
on the cabin videos to estimate the driver head pose, from which head scans >20
deg were computed in the horizontal direction. The scene videos were processed
using a YOLO object detection model to detect traffic lights, stop signs,
pedestrians, and other vehicles on the road. Turning maneuvers were
independently detected using vehicle self-motion patterns. Stop lines on the
road surface were detected using changing intensity patterns over time as the
vehicle moved. The information obtained from processing the scene videos, along
with the speed data was used in a rule-based algorithm to infer the
intersection type, maneuver, and bounds. We processed 190 intersections from 3
vehicles driven in cities and suburban areas from Massachusetts and California.
The automated video processing algorithm correctly detected intersection
signage and maneuvers in 100% and 94% of instances, respectively. The median
[IQR] error in detecting vehicle entry into the intersection was 1.1[0.4-4.9]
meters and 0.2[0.1-0.54] seconds. The median overlap between ground truth and
estimated intersection bounds was 0.88[0.82-0.93].

Abstract: Event cameras offering high dynamic range and low latency have emerged as
disruptive technologies in imaging. Despite growing research on leveraging
these benefits for different imaging tasks, a comprehensive study of recently

this survey, we first introduce a physical model and the characteristics of
different event sensors as the foundation. Following this, we highlight the
advancement and interaction of image/video enhancement tasks with events.
Additionally, we explore advanced tasks, which capture richer light information
with events, \eg~light field estimation, multi-view generation, and

Motivation: 交通标志检测在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有方法在特征提取单一和多尺度检测方面存在不足。

Method: MDDFNet结合动态双融合模块（增强特征多样性）和Mamba主干网络（自适应特征融合），解决上述问题。

Result: 在TT100K数据集上，MDDFNet性能优于其他先进检测器，同时保持实时处理能力。

Conclusion: MDDFNet有效解决了小交通标志检测的挑战，为自动驾驶提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The Detection of small objects, especially traffic signs, is a critical
sub-task in object detection and autonomous driving. Despite signficant
progress in previous research, two main challenges remain. First, the issue of
feature extraction being too singular. Second, the detection process struggles
to efectively handle objects of varying sizes or scales. These problems are
also prevalent in general object detection tasks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel object detection network, Mamba-based Dynamic Dual Fusion
Network (MDDFNet), for traffic sign detection. The network integrates a dynamic
dual fusion module and a Mamba-based backbone to simultaneously tackle the
aforementioned issues. Specifically, the dynamic dual fusion module utilizes
multiple branches to consolidate various spatial and semantic information, thus
enhancing feature diversity. The Mamba-based backbone leverages global feature
fusion and local feature interaction, combining features in an adaptive manner
to generate unique classification characteristics. Extensive experiments
conducted on the TT100K (Tsinghua-Tencent 100K) datasets demonstrate that
MDDFNet outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors, maintaining real-time
processing capabilities of single-stage models while achieving superior
performance. This confirms the efectiveness of MDDFNet in detecting small
traffic signs.

Motivation: 现有视频模型缺乏对未观测场景的记忆，导致智能体在部分观测环境中难以进行一致的长时程规划。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型预测未来RGB-D视频，并将其聚合为持久3D环境地图，通过条件化视频模型实现一致模拟。

Result: 模型能够准确模拟已观测和未观测部分的世界，提升下游任务中的规划和策略学习效果。

Conclusion: 持久性世界模型显著提升了智能体在复杂环境中的长时程规划和模拟能力。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the effects of future actions on the world is a
crucial ability of intelligent embodied agents, enabling agents to anticipate
the effects of their actions and make plans accordingly. While a large body of
existing work has explored how to construct such world models using video
models, they are often myopic in nature, without any memory of a scene not
captured by currently observed images, preventing agents from making consistent
long-horizon plans in complex environments where many parts of the scene are
partially observed. We introduce a new persistent embodied world model with an
explicit memory of previously generated content, enabling much more consistent
long-horizon simulation. During generation time, our video diffusion model
predicts RGB-D video of the future observations of the agent. This generation
is then aggregated into a persistent 3D map of the environment. By conditioning
the video model on this 3D spatial map, we illustrate how this enables video
world models to faithfully simulate both seen and unseen parts of the world.
Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of such a world model in downstream
embodied applications, enabling effective planning and policy learning.

TL;DR: GPT-4o展示了强大的多模态生成能力，但在空间推理、知识密集型任务和时序预测方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GPT-4o在多模态任务中的能力，评估其在图像生成和相关任务中的表现。

Method: 构建任务分类法和测试样本集，对GPT-4o在六类任务中进行定性测试。

Result: GPT-4o在通用合成任务中表现优异，但在空间推理、知识密集型任务和时序预测中存在不足。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在多模态生成方面取得显著进展，但在专业或安全关键领域仍需改进。

Abstract: Recently, the visual generation ability by GPT-4o(mni) has been unlocked by
OpenAI. It demonstrates a very remarkable generation capability with excellent
multimodal condition understanding and varied task instructions. In this paper,
we aim to explore the capabilities of GPT-4o across various tasks. Inspired by
previous study, we constructed a task taxonomy along with a carefully curated
set of test samples to conduct a comprehensive qualitative test. Benefiting
from GPT-4o's powerful multimodal comprehension, its image-generation process
demonstrates abilities surpassing those of traditional image-generation tasks.
Thus, regarding the dimensions of model capabilities, we evaluate its
performance across six task categories: traditional image generation tasks,
discriminative tasks, knowledge-based generation, commonsense-based generation,
spatially-aware image generation, and temporally-aware image generation. These
tasks not only assess the quality and conditional alignment of the model's
outputs but also probe deeper into GPT-4o's understanding of real-world
concepts. Our results reveal that GPT-4o performs impressively well in
general-purpose synthesis tasks, showing strong capabilities in text-to-image
generation, visual stylization, and low-level image processing. However,
significant limitations remain in its ability to perform precise spatial
reasoning, instruction-grounded generation, and consistent temporal prediction.
Furthermore, when faced with knowledge-intensive or domain-specific scenarios,
such as scientific illustrations or mathematical plots, the model often
exhibits hallucinations, factual errors, or structural inconsistencies. These
findings suggest that while GPT-4o marks a substantial advancement in unified
multimodal generation, there is still a long way to go before it can be
reliably applied to professional or safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: HCoG方法通过分解长描述并分层生成，解决了复杂属性3D对象生成的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D模型对复杂属性对象生成效果不佳，主要因文本编码器理解能力有限和遮挡部分生成顺序混乱。

Method: HCoG利用大语言模型分解长描述为部分块，按遮挡顺序分层生成，并通过目标区域定位和3D高斯核优化精确绑定属性。

Result: 实验证明HCoG能生成结构连贯、属性准确的复杂3D对象。

Conclusion: HCoG提供了一种自动化方法，显著提升了复杂属性3D对象的生成质量。

Abstract: Recent text-to-3D models can render high-quality assets, yet they still
stumble on objects with complex attributes. The key obstacles are: (1) existing
text-to-3D approaches typically lift text-to-image models to extract semantics
via text encoders, while the text encoder exhibits limited comprehension
ability for long descriptions, leading to deviated cross-attention focus,
subsequently wrong attribute binding in generated results. (2) Occluded object
parts demand a disciplined generation order and explicit part disentanglement.
Though some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues, their
quality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above
problems, we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation
(HCoG). It leverages a large language model to decompose the long description
into blocks representing different object parts, and orders them from inside
out according to occlusions, forming a hierarchical chain. Within each block we
first coarsely create components, then precisely bind attributes via
target-region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization.
Between blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to
seamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning
semantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only
relevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts.
Experiments confirm that HCoG yields structurally coherent, attribute-faithful
3D objects with complex attributes. The code is available at

Conclusion: RoboOccWorld为室内场景动态预测提供了有效解决方案，并发布了OccWorld-ScanNet基准。

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting the scene evolutions deeply affect the
exploration and decision of embodied agents. While traditional methods simulate
scene evolutions through trajectory prediction of potential instances, current
works use the occupancy world model as a generative framework for describing
fine-grained overall scene dynamics. However, existing methods cluster on the
outdoor structured road scenes, while ignoring the exploration of forecasting
3D occupancy scene evolutions for robots in indoor scenes. In this work, we
explore a new framework for learning the scene evolutions of observed
fine-grained occupancy and propose an occupancy world model based on the
combined spatio-temporal receptive field and guided autoregressive transformer
to forecast the scene evolutions, called RoboOccWorld. We propose the
Conditional Causal State Attention (CCSA), which utilizes camera poses of next
state as conditions to guide the autoregressive transformer to adapt and
understand the indoor robotics scenarios. In order to effectively exploit the
spatio-temporal cues from historical observations, Hybrid Spatio-Temporal
Aggregation (HSTA) is proposed to obtain the combined spatio-temporal receptive
field based on multi-scale spatio-temporal windows. In addition, we restructure
the OccWorld-ScanNet benchmark based on local annotations to facilitate the
evaluation of the indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction task.
Experimental results demonstrate that our RoboOccWorld outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in indoor 3D occupancy scene evolution prediction
task. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Rice is an essential staple food worldwide that is important in promoting
international trade, economic growth, and nutrition. Asian countries such as
China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are notable for their
significant contribution to the cultivation and utilization of rice. These
nations are also known for cultivating different rice grains, including short
and long grains. These sizes are further classified as basmati, jasmine, kainat
saila, ipsala, arborio, etc., catering to diverse culinary preferences and
cultural traditions. For both local and international trade, inspecting and
maintaining the quality of rice grains to satisfy customers and preserve a
country's reputation is necessary. Manual quality check and classification is
quite a laborious and time-consuming process. It is also highly prone to
mistakes. Therefore, an automatic solution must be proposed for the effective
and efficient classification of different varieties of rice grains. This
research paper presents an automatic framework based on a convolutional neural
network (CNN) for classifying different varieties of rice grains. We evaluated
the proposed model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall,
precision, and F1-Score. The CNN model underwent rigorous training and
validation, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate and a perfect area under each
class's Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The confusion matrix
analysis confirmed the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between the
different rice varieties, indicating minimal misclassifications. Additionally,
the integration of explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provided
valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, revealing how
specific features of the rice grains influenced classification outcomes.

Abstract: Functional grasp is essential for enabling dexterous multi-finger robot hands
to manipulate objects effectively. However, most prior work either focuses on
power grasping, which simply involves holding an object still, or relies on
costly teleoperated robot demonstrations to teach robots how to grasp each
object functionally. Instead, we propose extracting human grasp information
from web images since they depict natural and functional object interactions,
thereby bypassing the need for curated demonstrations. We reconstruct human
hand-object interaction (HOI) 3D meshes from RGB images, retarget the human
hand to multi-finger robot hands, and align the noisy object mesh with its
accurate 3D shape. We show that these relatively low-quality HOI data from
inexpensive web sources can effectively train a functional grasping model. To
further expand the grasp dataset for seen and unseen objects, we use the
initially-trained grasping policy with web data in the IsaacGym simulator to
generate physically feasible grasps while preserving functionality. We train
the grasping model on 10 object categories and evaluate it on 9 unseen objects,
including challenging items such as syringes, pens, spray bottles, and tongs,
which are underrepresented in existing datasets. The model trained on the web
HOI dataset, achieving a 75.8% success rate on seen objects and 61.8% across
all objects in simulation, with a 6.7% improvement in success rate and a 1.8x
increase in functionality ratings over baselines. Simulator-augmented data
further boosts performance from 61.8% to 83.4%. The sim-to-real transfer to the
LEAP Hand achieves a 85% success rate. Project website is at:

TL;DR: PCVS是一种实时视频流隐私保护方法，通过逻辑规范和模糊处理敏感对象，确保隐私保护，并在多个数据集中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护方法无法完全隐藏敏感对象且不适用于实时视频流，因此需要开发一种新方法。

Method: PCVS使用逻辑规范约束敏感对象的存在，通过检测模型和模糊处理实现实时隐私保护，并采用符合预测方法提供理论保证。

Result: PCVS在多个数据集中实现超过95%的规范满足率，显著优于其他方法，且理论界限得到验证。

Conclusion: PCVS在实时操作中有效保护隐私，同时不影响机器人正常功能。

Abstract: Many robots (e.g., iRobot's Roomba) operate based on visual observations from
live video streams, and such observations may inadvertently include
privacy-sensitive objects, such as personal identifiers. Existing approaches
for preserving privacy rely on deep learning models, differential privacy, or
cryptography. They lack guarantees for the complete concealment of all
sensitive objects. Guaranteeing concealment requires post-processing techniques
and thus is inadequate for real-time video streams. We develop a method for
privacy-constrained video streaming, PCVS, that conceals sensitive objects
within real-time video streams. PCVS takes a logical specification constraining
the existence of privacy-sensitive objects, e.g., never show faces when a
person exists. It uses a detection model to evaluate the existence of these
objects in each incoming frame. Then, it blurs out a subset of objects such
that the existence of the remaining objects satisfies the specification. We
then propose a conformal prediction approach to (i) establish a theoretical
lower bound on the probability of the existence of these objects in a sequence
of frames satisfying the specification and (ii) update the bound with the
arrival of each subsequent frame. Quantitative evaluations show that PCVS
achieves over 95 percent specification satisfaction rate in multiple datasets,
significantly outperforming other methods. The satisfaction rate is
consistently above the theoretical bounds across all datasets, indicating that
the established bounds hold. Additionally, we deploy PCVS on robots in
real-time operation and show that the robots operate normally without being
compromised when PCVS conceals objects.

Abstract: Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that pose serious health risks. Deep
learning aids in lesion segmentation, but CNN and Transformer-based models
often lack context modeling or demand heavy computation, limiting real-time use

global modeling and a multi-scale CNN for efficient local feature extraction.
To improve interpretability and mimic the human visual system, we apply Gabor
filters at multiple scales. Our method achieves high segmentation accuracy with
fewer parameters and faster computation. Extensive experiments show GaMNet
outperforms existing methods, notably reducing false positives and negatives,
which enhances the reliability of clinical diagnosis.

TL;DR: X-Transfer是一种新型攻击方法，揭示了CLIP模型的通用对抗漏洞，通过动态选择代理模型实现高效攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在多任务和领域中的广泛应用使其对抗扰动的脆弱性成为关键问题。

Method: X-Transfer利用动态代理缩放策略生成通用对抗扰动（UAP），实现跨数据、跨领域、跨模型和跨任务的攻击。

Result: X-Transfer显著优于现有UAP方法，为CLIP模型的对抗迁移性设定了新标准。

Conclusion: X-Transfer展示了CLIP模型的对抗漏洞，并为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: As Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are increasingly
adopted for diverse downstream tasks and integrated into large vision-language
models (VLMs), their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations has emerged as
a critical concern. In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel
attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP.
X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of
deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples,
tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super
transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain,
cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is
achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach.
Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are
computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate
scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates
from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a
new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is
publicly available in our
\href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.

Motivation: 现有唇部分割方法受限于训练数据中的唇轮廓标注和图像质量，导致分割边界不准确。

Method: 采用局部二值模式提取面部图像的微观模式，构建多维输入，并通过序列注意力UNet重建唇轮廓。引入基于解剖标志的掩模生成方法提升分割精度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了唇部分割精度，尤其在Cupid's弓区域，并为FAS的唇部特征分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Lip segmentation plays a crucial role in various domains, such as lip
synchronization, lipreading, and diagnostics. However, the effectiveness of
supervised lip segmentation is constrained by the availability of lip contour
in the training phase. A further challenge with lip segmentation is its
reliance on image quality , lighting, and skin tone, leading to inaccuracies in
the detected boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose a sequential
lip segmentation method that integrates attention UNet and multidimensional
input. We unravel the micro-patterns in facial images using local binary
patterns to build multidimensional inputs. Subsequently, the multidimensional
inputs are fed into sequential attention UNets, where the lip contour is
reconstructed. We introduce a mask generation method that uses a few anatomical
landmarks and estimates the complete lip contour to improve segmentation
accuracy. This mask has been utilized in the training phase for lip
segmentation. To evaluate the proposed method, we use facial images to segment
the upper lips and subsequently assess lip-related facial anomalies in subjects
with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Using the proposed lip segmentation method,
we achieved a mean dice score of 84.75%, and a mean pixel accuracy of 99.77% in
upper lip segmentation. To further evaluate the method, we implemented
classifiers to identify those with FAS. Using a generative adversarial network
(GAN), we reached an accuracy of 98.55% in identifying FAS in one of the study
populations. This method could be used to improve lip segmentation accuracy,
especially around Cupid's bow, and shed light on distinct lip-related
characteristics of FAS.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models represent an important step toward
general-purpose robotic systems by integrating visual perception, language
understanding, and action execution. However, systematic evaluation of these
models, particularly their zero-shot generalization capabilities in
out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, remains limited. In this paper, we
introduce MultiNet v0.2, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and
analyze the generalization performance of state-of-the-art VLM and VLA
models-including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, OpenVLA,Pi0 Base, and Pi0 FAST-on diverse
procedural tasks from the Procgen benchmark. Our analysis reveals several
critical insights: (1) all evaluated models exhibit significant limitations in
zero-shot generalization to OOD tasks, with performance heavily influenced by
factors such as action representation and task complexit; (2) VLAs generally
outperform other models due to their robust architectural design; and (3) VLM
variants demonstrate substantial improvements when constrained appropriately,
highlighting the sensitivity of model performance to precise prompt
engineering.

Abstract: The generation of realistic medical images from text descriptions has
significant potential to address data scarcity challenges in healthcare AI
while preserving patient privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive study of
text-to-image synthesis in the medical domain, comparing two distinct
approaches: (1) fine-tuning large pre-trained latent diffusion models and (2)
training small, domain-specific models. We introduce a novel model named MSDM,
an optimized architecture based on Stable Diffusion that integrates a clinical
text encoder, variational autoencoder, and cross-attention mechanisms to better
align medical text prompts with generated images. Our study compares two
approaches: fine-tuning large pre-trained models (FLUX, Kandinsky) versus
training compact domain-specific models (MSDM). Evaluation across colonoscopy

achieve higher fidelity, our optimized MSDM delivers comparable quality with
lower computational costs. Quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations by
medical experts reveal strengths and limitations of each approach.

Conclusion: SteepGS通过优化密度控制解决了3DGS的点云冗余问题，为资源受限设备提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for
real-time, high-resolution novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as a
mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for
efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture
fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional
points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting
in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands
- posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies
and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is
crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach,
we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal
number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction,
and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building
on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density
control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact
point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without
compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and
scalability.

TL;DR: ReactDance是一个基于扩散模型的新框架，用于高保真的反应性舞蹈生成，解决了现有方法在交互保真度、同步性和时间一致性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于强调全局约束和优化，忽略了局部信息（如细粒度空间交互和局部时间上下文），导致交互保真度和时间一致性不足。

Method: 提出GRFSQ（多尺度解耦运动表示）和BLC（局部块因果掩码采样策略），并结合LDCFG（层解耦无分类器引导）实现多尺度控制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ReactDance超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ReactDance通过多尺度解耦表示和局部上下文采样策略，显著提升了反应性舞蹈生成的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG) produces follower movements conditioned on
guiding dancer and music while ensuring spatial coordination and temporal
coherence. However, existing methods overemphasize global constraints and
optimization, overlooking local information, such as fine-grained spatial
interactions and localized temporal context. Therefore, we present ReactDance,
a novel diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity RDG with long-term
coherence and multi-scale controllability. Unlike existing methods that
struggle with interaction fidelity, synchronization, and temporal consistency
in duet synthesis, our approach introduces two key innovations: 1)Group
Residual Finite Scalar Quantization (GRFSQ), a multi-scale disentangled motion
representation that captures interaction semantics from coarse body rhythms to
fine-grained joint dynamics, and 2)Blockwise Local Context (BLC), a sampling
strategy eliminating error accumulation in long sequence generation via local
block causal masking and periodic positional encoding. Built on the decoupled
multi-scale GRFSQ representation, we implement a diffusion model
withLayer-Decoupled Classifier-free Guidance (LDCFG), allowing granular control
over motion semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate that ReactDance surpasses existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: QuickSplat利用数据驱动先验生成2D高斯泼溅优化的密集初始化，加速大规模室内场景重建，并改进几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体积渲染的方法优化速度慢，难以处理未充分观察或无纹理区域。

Method: 学习数据驱动先验生成密集初始化，联合估计场景参数更新和高斯泼溅的密集化。

Result: 实验显示，运行时间加速8倍，深度误差减少48%。

Conclusion: QuickSplat在速度和精度上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction is fundamental to computer vision and graphics,
enabling applications in 3D modeling, mixed reality, robotics, and more.
Existing approaches based on volumetric rendering obtain promising results, but
optimize on a per-scene basis, resulting in a slow optimization that can
struggle to model under-observed or textureless regions. We introduce
QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations
for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This
provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the
convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall
structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update
of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network
predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones,
removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on
large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our
data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while
decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中目标定位因对象多样性、低分辨率和噪声干扰而困难，需针对特定数据集（如重力波、中层大气波和海洋涡旋）设计解决方案。

Method: 引入YOLO-DCAP，结合多尺度扩张残差卷积（MDRC）和注意力辅助空间池化（AaSP）模块，优化特征提取和目标定位。

Result: YOLO-DCAP在mAP50和IoU上分别比基准模型提升20.95%和32.23%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: YOLO-DCAP在多个卫星数据集上表现稳健且通用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Object localization in satellite imagery is particularly challenging due to
the high variability of objects, low spatial resolution, and interference from
noise and dominant features such as clouds and city lights. In this research,
we focus on three satellite datasets: upper atmospheric Gravity Waves (GW),
mesospheric Bores (Bore), and Ocean Eddies (OE), each presenting its own unique
challenges. These challenges include the variability in the scale and
appearance of the main object patterns, where the size, shape, and feature
extent of objects of interest can differ significantly. To address these
challenges, we introduce YOLO-DCAP, a novel enhanced version of YOLOv5 designed
to improve object localization in these complex scenarios. YOLO-DCAP
incorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture
multi-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an
Attention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant
spatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements
help to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model
and state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in
mAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively
over state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite
datasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight
the robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach. Our code is open

Motivation: 探讨GPT-4o在图像修复领域的潜力，填补系统性评估的空白，并推动图像生成领域的创新。

Method: 通过图像去雾、去雨和低光增强等案例研究，评估GPT-4o的输出作为视觉先验的效果。

Result: GPT-4o的输出虽视觉吸引，但结构保真度不足；作为先验可显著提升现有去雾网络性能。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在图像修复中具有潜力，研究为未来整合提供了实践指南和基准框架，并公开数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: OpenAI's GPT-4o model, integrating multi-modal inputs and outputs within an
autoregressive architecture, has demonstrated unprecedented performance in
image generation. In this work, we investigate its potential impact on the
image restoration community. We present the first systematic evaluation of
GPT-4o across diverse restoration tasks. Our experiments reveal that, although
restoration outputs from GPT-4o are visually appealing, they often suffer from
pixel-level structural fidelity when compared to ground-truth images. Common
issues are variations in image proportions, shifts in object positions and
quantities, and changes in viewpoint.To address it, taking image dehazing,
derainning, and low-light enhancement as representative case studies, we show
that GPT-4o's outputs can serve as powerful visual priors, substantially
enhancing the performance of existing dehazing networks. It offers practical
guidelines and a baseline framework to facilitate the integration of GPT-4o
into future image restoration pipelines. We hope the study on GPT-4o image
restoration will accelerate innovation in the broader field of image generation
areas. To support further research, we will release GPT-4o-restored images from
over 10 widely used image restoration datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在视觉与语言对齐方面存在不足，往往过度依赖语言先验，未能充分利用视觉输入。

Method: 通过分析MLLMs内部如何构建对图像区域的理解，并引入技术来增强这种能力，同时确保视觉信息能主动引导语言生成。

Result: 模型在视觉依赖的词汇预测能力上表现优异，并在视觉挑战性任务中提升了10个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MLLMs的多模态理解能力，实现了视觉与语言的深度对齐。

Abstract: Achieving deep alignment between vision and language remains a central
challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models often fail
to fully leverage visual input, defaulting to strong language priors. Our
approach first provides insights into how MLLMs internally build visual
understanding of image regions and then introduces techniques to amplify this
capability. Specifically, we explore techniques designed both to deepen the
model's understanding of visual content and to ensure that these visual
insights actively guide language generation. We demonstrate the superior
multimodal understanding of our resultant model through a detailed upstream
analysis quantifying its ability to predict visually-dependent tokens as well
as 10 pt boost on visually challenging tasks.

Conclusion: 该研究通过结合百科全书知识和视觉识别，推动了开放词汇识别的发展，为生物多样性监测提供了灵活可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary recognition remains a challenging problem in computer vision,
as it requires identifying objects from an unbounded set of categories. This is
particularly relevant in nature, where new species are discovered every year.
In this work, we focus on open-vocabulary bird species recognition, where the
goal is to classify species based on their descriptions without being
constrained to a predefined set of taxonomic categories. Traditional benchmarks
like CUB-200-2011 and Birdsnap have been evaluated in a closed-vocabulary
paradigm, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios where novel
species continually emerge. We show that the performance of current systems
when evaluated under settings closely aligned with open-vocabulary drops by a
huge margin. To address this gap, we propose a scalable framework integrating
structured textual knowledge from Wikipedia articles of 11,202 bird species
distilled via GPT-4o into concise, discriminative summaries. We propose Visual
Re-ranking Retrieval-Augmented Generation(VR-RAG), a novel, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that uses visual similarities to rerank the top m
candidates retrieved by a set of multimodal vision language encoders. This
allows for the recognition of unseen taxa. Extensive experiments across five
established classification benchmarks show that our approach is highly
effective. By integrating VR-RAG, we improve the average performance of
state-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Model QWEN2.5-VL by 15.4% across five
benchmarks. Our approach outperforms conventional VLM-based approaches, which
struggle with unseen species. By bridging the gap between encyclopedic
knowledge and visual recognition, our work advances open-vocabulary
recognition, offering a flexible, scalable solution for biodiversity monitoring
and ecological research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了神经风格迁移（NST）在提升动物面部关键点检测器训练中的应用，通过改进生成图像质量和数据增强，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NST主要用于艺术风格转换，本研究将其应用于动物面部关键点检测，以提升训练数据的多样性和模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用裁剪后的面部图像进行风格迁移以保持结构一致性；提出监督风格迁移（SST）解决标注对齐问题；通过风格迁移图像增强数据集。

Result: 裁剪面部图像提升了生成质量；SST保留了98%的基线准确率；风格迁移增强的数据集优于传统增强方法。

Conclusion: 语义风格迁移是提升面部关键点检测模型性能的有效策略，可推广至其他物种和模型。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a technique for applying the visual
characteristics of one image onto another while preserving structural content.
Traditionally used for artistic transformations, NST has recently been adapted,
e.g., for domain adaptation and data augmentation. This study investigates the
use of this technique for enhancing animal facial landmark detectors training.
As a case study, we use a recently introduced Ensemble Landmark Detector for 48
anatomical cat facial landmarks and the CatFLW dataset it was trained on,
making three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that applying style
transfer to cropped facial images rather than full-body images enhances
structural consistency, improving the quality of generated images. Secondly,
replacing training images with style-transferred versions raised challenges of
annotation misalignment, but Supervised Style Transfer (SST) - which selects
style sources based on landmark accuracy - retained up to 98% of baseline
accuracy. Finally, augmenting the dataset with style-transferred images further
improved robustness, outperforming traditional augmentation methods. These
findings establish semantic style transfer as an effective augmentation
strategy for enhancing the performance of facial landmark detection models for
animals and beyond. While this study focuses on cat facial landmarks, the
proposed method can be generalized to other species and landmark detection
models.

Method: 采用统一的Transformer架构，学习灰度图像、数字高程模型、表面法线和反照率图等多模态间的共享表示，支持任意输入到目标模态的转换。

Result: 模型成功学习了四种模态间的物理合理关系，同时实现了3D重建和反射率参数解耦。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来扩展更多输入模态（如光度归一化和共配准）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines
but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we
identify that reflectance parameter estimation and image-based 3D
reconstruction of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning
problem. We propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn
shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, digital
elevation models, surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports
flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Predicting
DEMs and albedo maps from grayscale images simultaneously solves the task of 3D
reconstruction of planetary surfaces and disentangles photometric parameters
and height information. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model
learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. Adding more
input modalities in the future will enable tasks such as photometric
normalization and co-registration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCR在复杂文档中易出错，视觉语言方法（如ColPali）试图绕过OCR直接处理文档，但需验证其实际效果。

Method: 系统比较ColPali与OCR-based RAG（使用Llama 3.2和Nougat OCR），引入语义答案评估基准。

Result: 视觉RAG在训练文档上表现好，但OCR-based RAG对未见文档泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 需权衡计算效率与语义准确性，为生产环境选择合适的RAG系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a popular technique for
enhancing the reliability and utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
grounding responses in external documents. Traditional RAG systems rely on
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to first process scanned documents into
text. However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in
degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as
ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for
OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG
system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2
(90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional
retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark
to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that
while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on,
OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying
quality. We highlight the key trade-offs between computational efficiency and
semantic accuracy, offering practical guidance for RAG practitioners in
selecting between OCR-dependent and vision-based document retrieval systems in
production environments.

Abstract: Sparse volumetric reconstruction and rendering via 3D Gaussian splatting have
recently enabled animatable 3D head avatars that are rendered under arbitrary
viewpoints with impressive photorealism. Today, such photoreal avatars are seen
as a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality,
and entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex
non-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images;
due to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss
of fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts,
built from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art
models are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D
Gaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address
these problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves
upon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and
modeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is
reconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D
morphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head.
Photoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous
UVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where
most needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD
deformation field to capture subtle, localized motion. Our key contribution is
the novel deformable Gaussian encoding and overall fitting procedure that
allows our head model to preserve appearance detail, while capturing facial
motion and other transient high-frequency features such as skin wrinkling.

Result: 生成的图像能够更好地满足对象数量、实例级属性和空间关系等复杂提示的要求。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合图像结构引导和LLM指令，显著提升了生成模型在复杂提示下的表现。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the capabilities of generative models,
pretrained text-to-image models still struggle in capturing the semantics
conveyed by complex prompts that compound multiple objects and instance-level
attributes. Consequently, we are witnessing growing interests in integrating
additional structural constraints, %leveraging additional structural inputs
typically in the form of coarse bounding boxes, to better guide the generation
process in such challenging cases. In this work, we take the idea of structural
guidance a step further by making the observation that contemporary image
generation models can directly provide a plausible \emph{fine-grained}
structural initialization. We propose a technique that couples this image-based
structural guidance with LLM-based instance-level instructions, yielding output
images that adhere to all parts of the text prompt, including object counts,
instance-level attributes, and spatial relations between instances.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了卷尾猴视频检索的性能，未来可扩展至其他野生动物研究。

Abstract: Video recordings of nonhuman primates in their natural habitat are a common
source for studying their behavior in the wild. We fine-tune pre-trained
video-text foundational models for the specific domain of capuchin monkeys,
with the goal of developing useful computational models to help researchers to
retrieve useful clips from videos. We focus on the challenging problem of
training a model based solely on raw, unlabeled video footage, using weak audio
descriptions sometimes provided by field collaborators. We leverage recent
advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to address the extremely noisy nature of both video and audio content.
Specifically, we propose a two-folded approach: an agentic data treatment
pipeline and a fine-tuning process. The data processing pipeline automatically
extracts clean and semantically aligned video-text pairs from the raw videos,
which are subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained Microsoft's X-CLIP model
through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We obtained an uplift in $Hits@5$ of
$167\%$ for the 16 frames model and an uplift of $114\%$ for the 8 frame model
on our domain data. Moreover, based on $NDCG@K$ results, our model is able to
rank well most of the considered behaviors, while the tested raw pre-trained
models are not able to rank them at all. The code will be made available upon
acceptance.

Result: 模型在Indian Pines数据集上实现了最优的分类性能。

Conclusion: 双掩码和波长感知嵌入提升了高光谱图像的重建和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectral detail but poses unique
challenges because of its high dimensionality in both spatial and spectral
domains. We propose \textit{HyperspectralMAE}, a Transformer-based foundation
model for hyperspectral data that employs a \textit{dual masking} strategy:
during pre-training we randomly occlude 50\% of spatial patches and 50\% of
spectral bands. This forces the model to learn representations capable of
reconstructing missing information across both dimensions. To encode spectral
order, we introduce learnable harmonic Fourier positional embeddings based on
wavelength. The reconstruction objective combines mean-squared error (MSE) with
the spectral angle mapper (SAM) to balance pixel-level accuracy and
spectral-shape fidelity.
  The resulting model contains about $1.8\times10^{8}$ parameters and produces
768-dimensional embeddings, giving it sufficient capacity for transfer
learning. We pre-trained HyperspectralMAE on two large hyperspectral corpora --
NASA EO-1 Hyperion ($\sim$1\,600 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel spectra)
and DLR EnMAP Level-0 ($\sim$1\,300 scenes, $\sim$$3\times10^{11}$ pixel
spectra) -- and fine-tuned it for land-cover classification on the Indian Pines
benchmark. HyperspectralMAE achieves state-of-the-art transfer-learning
accuracy on Indian Pines, confirming that masked dual-dimensional pre-training
yields robust spectral-spatial representations. These results demonstrate that
dual masking and wavelength-aware embeddings advance hyperspectral image
reconstruction and downstream analysis.

Result: DiGIT在THUMOS14、ActivityNet v1.3和HACS-Segment数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DiGIT有效解决了时序动作检测中的冗余和上下文问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we examine a key limitation in query-based detectors for
temporal action detection (TAD), which arises from their direct adaptation of
originally designed architectures for object detection. Despite the
effectiveness of the existing models, they struggle to fully address the unique
challenges of TAD, such as the redundancy in multi-scale features and the
limited ability to capture sufficient temporal context. To address these
issues, we propose a multi-dilated gated encoder and central-adjacent region
integrated decoder for temporal action detection transformer (DiGIT). Our
approach replaces the existing encoder that consists of multi-scale deformable
attention and feedforward network with our multi-dilated gated encoder. Our
proposed encoder reduces the redundant information caused by multi-level
features while maintaining the ability to capture fine-grained and long-range
temporal information. Furthermore, we introduce a central-adjacent region
integrated decoder that leverages a more comprehensive sampling strategy for
deformable cross-attention to capture the essential information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DiGIT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
THUMOS14, ActivityNet v1.3, and HACS-Segment. Code is available at:

Conclusion: SeDA通过渐进式对齐和语义空间干预，有效解决了跨模态对齐的分布差异问题。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an effective approach to improving visual
classification. Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses
deep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution
of textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such
a projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise
samples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method,
termed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual
projection, considering both types of features share the same class-level
information in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework
is developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities.
Specifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to
model the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the
interactive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual
features. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic
Translator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the
semantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network
introduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively
integrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show
that SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior
performance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.

*Valay Bundele,Mehran Hosseinzadeh,Hendrik Lensch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgTracker是一种半监督框架，通过自蒸馏和循环一致性约束，将合成数据训练的点跟踪器适应于手术视频，显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据训练的点跟踪器在真实世界（如手术视频）中存在领域偏移和标注数据不足的问题，需要一种有效的适应方法。

Method: 使用固定教师模型生成在线伪标签，并通过循环一致性过滤不一致轨迹，实现几何一致性和稳定监督。

Result: 在STIR基准测试中，仅使用80个未标记视频，SurgTracker显著提升了跟踪性能。

Conclusion: SurgTracker在领域偏移大、数据稀缺的场景中展现出强大的适应潜力。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets have enabled significant progress in point tracking by
providing large-scale, densely annotated supervision. However, deploying these
models in real-world domains remains challenging due to domain shift and lack
of labeled data-issues that are especially severe in surgical videos, where
scenes exhibit complex tissue deformation, occlusion, and lighting variation.
While recent approaches adapt synthetic-trained trackers to natural videos
using teacher ensembles or augmentation-heavy pseudo-labeling pipelines, their
effectiveness in high-shift domains like surgery remains unexplored. This work
presents SurgTracker, a semi-supervised framework for adapting
synthetic-trained point trackers to surgical video using filtered
self-distillation. Pseudo-labels are generated online by a fixed
teacher-identical in architecture and initialization to the student-and are
filtered using a cycle consistency constraint to discard temporally
inconsistent trajectories. This simple yet effective design enforces geometric
consistency and provides stable supervision throughout training, without the
computational overhead of maintaining multiple teachers. Experiments on the
STIR benchmark show that SurgTracker improves tracking performance using only
80 unlabeled videos, demonstrating its potential for robust adaptation in
high-shift, data-scarce domains.

Result: 在AI-TOD-V2和VisDrone数据集上分别提升3.3 AP和2.5 AP，同时保持低计算复杂性和小模型体积。

Conclusion: Dome-DETR通过创新方法显著提升了小目标检测的效率和性能。

Abstract: Tiny object detection plays a vital role in drone surveillance, remote
sensing, and autonomous systems, enabling the identification of small targets
across vast landscapes. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient
feature leverage and high computational costs due to redundant feature
processing and rigid query allocation. To address these challenges, we propose
Dome-DETR, a novel framework with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation
for Efficient Tiny Object Detection. To reduce feature redundancies, we
introduce a lightweight Density-Focal Extractor (DeFE) to produce clustered
compact foreground masks. Leveraging these masks, we incorporate Masked Window
Attention Sparsification (MWAS) to focus computational resources on the most
informative regions via sparse attention. Besides, we propose Progressive
Adaptive Query Initialization (PAQI), which adaptively modulates query density
across spatial areas for better query allocation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Dome-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance (+3.3 AP on
AI-TOD-V2 and +2.5 AP on VisDrone) while maintaining low computational
complexity and a compact model size. Code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于密度的凝聚聚类方法kFuse，解决了传统方法需要额外参数和聚类结果不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统凝聚聚类方法需要额外参数且结果不稳定，缺乏先验知识时难以应用。

Method: kFuse通过自然邻居划分子簇，计算边界连接性和密度相似性，并基于此建立合并规则。

Result: 实验证明kFuse在合成和真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: kFuse显著提升了聚类准确性和稳定性，仅需在最后阶段指定簇数。

Abstract: Agglomerative clustering has emerged as a vital tool in data analysis due to
its intuitive and flexible characteristics. However, existing agglomerative
clustering methods often involve additional parameters for sub-cluster
partitioning and inter-cluster similarity assessment. This necessitates
different parameter settings across various datasets, which is undoubtedly
challenging in the absence of prior knowledge. Moreover, existing agglomerative
clustering techniques are constrained by the calculation method of connection
distance, leading to unstable clustering results. To address these issues, this
paper introduces a novel density-based agglomerative clustering method, termed
kFuse. kFuse comprises four key components: (1) sub-cluster partitioning based
on natural neighbors; (2) determination of boundary connectivity between
sub-clusters through the computation of adjacent samples and shortest
distances; (3) assessment of density similarity between sub-clusters via the
calculation of mean density and variance; and (4) establishment of merging
rules between sub-clusters based on boundary connectivity and density
similarity. kFuse requires the specification of the number of clusters only at
the final merging stage. Additionally, by comprehensively considering adjacent
samples, distances, and densities among different sub-clusters, kFuse
significantly enhances accuracy during the merging phase, thereby greatly
improving its identification capability. Experimental results on both synthetic
and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of kFuse.

Abstract: Automation can play a prominent role in improving efficiency, accuracy, and
scalability in infrastructure surveying and assessing construction and
compliance standards. This paper presents a framework for automation of
geometric measurements and compliance assessment using point cloud data. The
proposed approach integrates deep learning-based detection and segmentation, in
conjunction with geometric and signal processing techniques, to automate
surveying tasks. As a proof of concept, we apply this framework to
automatically evaluate the compliance of curb ramps with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), demonstrating the utility of point cloud data in survey
automation. The method leverages a newly collected, large annotated dataset of
curb ramps, made publicly available as part of this work, to facilitate robust
model training and evaluation. Experimental results, including comparison with
manual field measurements of several ramps, validate the accuracy and
reliability of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to significantly
reduce manual effort and improve consistency in infrastructure assessment.
Beyond ADA compliance, the proposed framework lays the groundwork for broader
applications in infrastructure surveying and automated construction evaluation,
promoting wider adoption of point cloud data in these domains. The annotated
database, manual ramp survey data, and developed algorithms are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有局部描述模型未广泛应用于医学领域，而医学诊断依赖区域细节，因此需要专门解决方案。

Method: MedDAM结合医学专家设计的提示和评估基准，通过属性级验证任务评估临床事实性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MedDAM优于GPT-4o等领先模型，展示了区域语义对齐的重要性。

Conclusion: MedDAM为临床视觉-语言集成提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Localized image captioning has made significant progress with models like the
Describe Anything Model (DAM), which can generate detailed region-specific
descriptions without explicit region-text supervision. However, such
capabilities have yet to be widely applied to specialized domains like medical
imaging, where diagnostic interpretation relies on subtle regional findings
rather than global understanding. To mitigate this gap, we propose MedDAM, the
first comprehensive framework leveraging large vision-language models for
region-specific captioning in medical images. MedDAM employs medical
expert-designed prompts tailored to specific imaging modalities and establishes
a robust evaluation benchmark comprising a customized assessment protocol, data
pre-processing pipeline, and specialized QA template library. This benchmark
evaluates both MedDAM and other adaptable large vision-language models,
focusing on clinical factuality through attribute-level verification tasks,
thereby circumventing the absence of ground-truth region-caption pairs in
medical datasets. Extensive experiments on the VinDr-CXR, LIDC-IDRI, and
SkinCon datasets demonstrate MedDAM's superiority over leading peers (including
GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, LLaMA-3.2 Vision, Qwen2.5-VL, GPT-4Rol, and
OMG-LLaVA) in the task, revealing the importance of region-level semantic
alignment in medical image understanding and establishing MedDAM as a promising
foundation for clinical vision-language integration.

Motivation: 传统变分模型数学可解释性强但参数敏感且计算成本高，而深度学习模型如UNet轻量但缺乏理论解释性且需要大量标注数据。结合两者优势以提升分割效果。

Method: 将四阶修正Cahn-Hilliard方程与UNet结合，引入数据驱动算子替代手动调参，并采用TFPM方法实现高精度边界保留。

Result: 在基准数据集上，VM_TUNet的分割性能优于现有方法，尤其在精细边界划分上表现突出。

Conclusion: VM_TUNet成功融合了变分模型和深度学习的优势，为图像分割提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image segmentation methods, such as variational models based on
partial differential equations (PDEs), offer strong mathematical
interpretability and precise boundary modeling, but often suffer from
sensitivity to parameter settings and high computational costs. In contrast,
deep learning models such as UNet, which are relatively lightweight in
parameters, excel in automatic feature extraction but lack theoretical
interpretability and require extensive labeled data. To harness the
complementary strengths of both paradigms, we propose Variational Model Based
Tailored UNet (VM_TUNet), a novel hybrid framework that integrates the
fourth-order modified Cahn-Hilliard equation with the deep learning backbone of
UNet, which combines the interpretability and edge-preserving properties of
variational methods with the adaptive feature learning of neural networks.
Specifically, a data-driven operator is introduced to replace manual parameter
tuning, and we incorporate the tailored finite point method (TFPM) to enforce
high-precision boundary preservation. Experimental results on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that VM_TUNet achieves superior segmentation performance
compared to existing approaches, especially for fine boundary delineation.

Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiT）的高计算复杂度限制了其部署，现有缓存加速方法可能因缺乏校准导致质量下降。

Method: 提出增量校准缓存方法，利用预训练模型生成校准参数，并通过通道感知SVD处理异常激活。

Result: 在相同计算资源下优于现有缓存方法，减少45%计算量，IS提升12，FID仅增加0.06。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外训练，显著提升DiT的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) models have achieved remarkable success in image
generation, thanks for their exceptional generative capabilities and
scalability. Nonetheless, the iterative nature of diffusion models (DMs)
results in high computation complexity, posing challenges for deployment.
Although existing cache-based acceleration methods try to utilize the inherent
temporal similarity to skip redundant computations of DiT, the lack of
correction may induce potential quality degradation. In this paper, we propose
increment-calibrated caching, a training-free method for DiT acceleration,
where the calibration parameters are generated from the pre-trained model
itself with low-rank approximation. To deal with the possible correction
failure arising from outlier activations, we introduce channel-aware Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), which further strengthens the calibration effect.
Experimental results show that our method always achieve better performance
than existing naive caching methods with a similar computation resource budget.
When compared with 35-step DDIM, our method eliminates more than 45%
computation and improves IS by 12 at the cost of less than 0.06 FID increase.

Result: 在多个图像序数回归数据集上表现优异，尤其擅长区分难分类样本。

Conclusion: DFPG框架有效结合补丁级特征和模糊逻辑，提升了序数回归任务的性能。

Abstract: Ordinal regression bridges regression and classification by assigning objects
to ordered classes. While human experts rely on discriminative patch-level
features for decisions, current approaches are limited by the availability of
only image-level ordinal labels, overlooking fine-grained patch-level
characteristics. In this paper, we propose a Dual-level Fuzzy Learning with
Patch Guidance framework, named DFPG that learns precise feature-based grading
boundaries from ambiguous ordinal labels, with patch-level supervision.
Specifically, we propose patch-labeling and filtering strategies to enable the
model to focus on patch-level features exclusively with only image-level
ordinal labels available. We further design a dual-level fuzzy learning module,
which leverages fuzzy logic to quantitatively capture and handle label
ambiguity from both patch-wise and channel-wise perspectives. Extensive
experiments on various image ordinal regression datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, further confirming its ability in
distinguishing samples from difficult-to-classify categories. The code is

Abstract: Knots in wood are critical to both aesthetics and structural integrity,
making their detection and pairing essential in timber processing. However,
traditional manual annotation was labor-intensive and inefficient,
necessitating automation. This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated
pipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques.
In the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were
collected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was
manually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l
achieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were
analyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet
neural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling
clustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet
network with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further
analysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the
bottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles
in achieving high pairing accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness
of the proposed solution, demonstrating the potential of AI in advancing wood
science and industry.

Abstract: Modern 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis approaches have
demonstrated strong performance on scenes with opaque Lambertian objects.
However, most assume straight light paths and therefore cannot properly handle
refractive and reflective materials. Moreover, datasets specialized for these
effects are limited, stymieing efforts to evaluate performance and develop
suitable techniques. In this work, we introduce a synthetic RefRef dataset and
benchmark for reconstructing scenes with refractive and reflective objects from
posed images. Our dataset has 50 such objects of varying complexity, from
single-material convex shapes to multi-material non-convex shapes, each placed
in three different background types, resulting in 150 scenes. We also propose
an oracle method that, given the object geometry and refractive indices,
calculates accurate light paths for neural rendering, and an approach based on
this that avoids these assumptions. We benchmark these against several
state-of-the-art methods and show that all methods lag significantly behind the
oracle, highlighting the challenges of the task and dataset.

Conclusion: PICD是一种高效的通用压缩方法，适用于屏幕和自然图像，显著提升了压缩质量。

Abstract: Recently, perceptual image compression has achieved significant advancements,
delivering high visual quality at low bitrates for natural images. However, for
screen content, existing methods often produce noticeable artifacts when
compressing text. To tackle this challenge, we propose versatile perceptual
screen image compression with diffusion rendering (PICD), a codec that works
well for both screen and natural images. More specifically, we propose a
compression framework that encodes the text and image separately, and renders
them into one image using diffusion model. For this diffusion rendering, we
integrate conditional information into diffusion models at three distinct
levels: 1). Domain level: We fine-tune the base diffusion model using text
content prompts with screen content. 2). Adaptor level: We develop an efficient
adaptor to control the diffusion model using compressed image and text as
input. 3). Instance level: We apply instance-wise guidance to further enhance
the decoding process. Empirically, our PICD surpasses existing perceptual
codecs in terms of both text accuracy and perceptual quality. Additionally,
without text conditions, our approach serves effectively as a perceptual codec
for natural images.

Motivation: MRI的多对比特性为跨模态增强提供了机会，但现有方法依赖配对数据且分辨率固定，难以适应临床环境。

Method: 分为两阶段：无配对跨模态合成（U-CMS）和无监督超分辨率（U-SR），利用隐式神经表示（INRs）实现任意放大。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实临床环境中具有潜力，支持可扩展、个体化和数据高效的多对比超分辨率。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical for clinical diagnostics but is
often limited by long acquisition times and low signal-to-noise ratios,
especially in modalities like diffusion and functional MRI. The multi-contrast
nature of MRI presents a valuable opportunity for cross-modal enhancement,
where high-resolution (HR) modalities can serve as references to boost the
quality of their low-resolution (LR) counterparts-motivating the development of
Multi-Contrast Super-Resolution (MCSR) techniques. Prior work has shown that
leveraging complementary contrasts can improve SR performance; however,
effective feature extraction and fusion across modalities with varying
resolutions remains a major challenge. Moreover, existing MCSR methods often
assume fixed resolution settings and all require large, perfectly paired
training datasets-conditions rarely met in real-world clinical environments. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel Modular Multi-Contrast
Super-Resolution (MCSR) framework that eliminates the need for paired training
data and supports arbitrary upscaling. Our method decouples the MCSR task into
two stages: (1) Unpaired Cross-Modal Synthesis (U-CMS), which translates a
high-resolution reference modality into a synthesized version of the target
contrast, and (2) Unsupervised Super-Resolution (U-SR), which reconstructs the
final output using implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on
spatial coordinates. This design enables scale-agnostic and anatomically
faithful reconstruction by bridging un-paired cross-modal synthesis with
unsupervised resolution enhancement. Experiments show that our method achieves
superior performance at 4x and 8x upscaling, with improved fidelity and
anatomical consistency over existing baselines. Our framework demonstrates
strong potential for scalable, subject-specific, and data-efficient MCSR in
real-world clinical settings.

Conclusion: FaSDiff通过频率增强和扩散先验，实现了高质量的面部图像压缩，兼顾人眼和机器视觉需求。

Abstract: With the widespread application of facial image data across various domains,
the efficient storage and transmission of facial images has garnered
significant attention. However, the existing learned face image compression
methods often produce unsatisfactory reconstructed image quality at low bit
rates. Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial
compression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in
downstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency
information. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image
compression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior
(FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement.
FaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end
framework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts.
Additionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that
disentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion
prior alongside visual prompts. The proposed modules allow FaSDiff to leverage
diffusion priors for superior human visual perception while minimizing
performance loss in machine vision due to semantic inconsistency. Extensive
experiments show that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing
human visual quality and machine vision accuracy. The code will be released
after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 需谨慎解释大型ViT的注意力图，明确寄存器与CLS标记的问题，为更可解释的视觉模型提供方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2
model exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance
on dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch
tokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image
information. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been
incorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We
carefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship
between global and local image features, showing that while register tokens
yield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the
integration of local image information in large models. Instead, global
information is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading
to a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings,
we show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register,
leads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens.
Our work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of
large ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register
and CLS tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems require intelligent and adaptive
solutions to handle frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design
variations. We introduce a vision-language framework for understanding and
interacting with automotive infotainment systems, enabling seamless adaptation
across different UI designs. To further support research in this field, we
release AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset of 998 images with 4,208
annotations. Additionally, we present a synthetic data pipeline to generate
training data. We fine-tune a Molmo-7B-based model using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRa) and incorporating reasoning generated by our pipeline, along with visual
grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action
Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and
dataset are available on Hugging Face) and demonstrating strong cross-domain
generalization, including a +5.2% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline
model. Notably, our approach achieves 80.4% average accuracy on ScreenSpot,
closely matching or even surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and
web, such as ShowUI, despite being trained for the infotainment domain. This
research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead
to AI-driven progress within automotive UI understanding and interaction. The
applied method is cost-efficient and fine-tuned models can be deployed on
consumer-grade GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测仅关注结构特征，而论文希望通过分析异常原因（内部和外部缺陷力）来改进检测方法。

Method: 提出MC4AD框架，包括DA-Gen模块模拟异常，CFP-Net预测纠正力，并结合对称损失和整体损失优化模型。

Result: 在六个数据集上取得九项最优性能，参数最少且推理速度最快。

Conclusion: MC4AD通过模拟异常原因和纠正力，显著提升了3D异常检测的效率和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we go beyond identifying anomalies only in structural terms
and think about better anomaly detection motivated by anomaly causes. Most
anomalies are regarded as the result of unpredictable defective forces from
internal and external sources, and their opposite forces are sought to correct
the anomalies. We introduced a Mechanics Complementary framework for 3D anomaly
detection (MC4AD) to generate internal and external Corrective forces for each
point. A Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module is first proposed to
simulate various anomalies. Then, we present a Corrective Force Prediction
Network (CFP-Net) with complementary representations for point-level
representation to simulate the different contributions of internal and external
corrective forces. A combined loss was proposed, including a new symmetric loss
and an overall loss, to constrain the corrective forces properly. As a
highlight, we consider 3D anomaly detection in industry more comprehensively,
creating a hierarchical quality control strategy based on a three-way decision
and contributing a dataset named Anomaly-IntraVariance with intraclass variance
to evaluate the model. On the proposed and existing five datasets, we obtained
nine state-of-the-art performers with the minimum parameters and the fastest
inference speed. The source is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Swin Transformer和CNN的双重特征均衡网络，用于医学图像分割，通过图像级和类别级特征均衡提升像素特征表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未考虑边界像素和低类别像素区域的上下文特征信息不均问题，导致误分类。

Method: 设计图像级和类别级特征均衡模块，结合Swin Transformer增强长距离依赖和空间相关性。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 双重特征均衡网络有效解决了特征不均问题，提升了分割精度。

Abstract: Current methods for medical image segmentation primarily focus on extracting
contextual feature information from the perspective of the whole image. While
these methods have shown effective performance, none of them take into account
the fact that pixels at the boundary and regions with a low number of class
pixels capture more contextual feature information from other classes, leading
to misclassification of pixels by unequal contextual feature information. In
this paper, we propose a dual feature equalization network based on the hybrid
architecture of Swin Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, aiming to
augment the pixel feature representations by image-level equalization feature
information and class-level equalization feature information. Firstly, the
image-level feature equalization module is designed to equalize the contextual
information of pixels within the image. Secondly, we aggregate regions of the
same class to equalize the pixel feature representations of the corresponding
class by class-level feature equalization module. Finally, the pixel feature
representations are enhanced by learning weights for image-level equalization
feature information and class-level equalization feature information. In
addition, Swin Transformer is utilized as both the encoder and decoder, thereby
bolstering the ability of the model to capture long-range dependencies and
spatial correlations. We conducted extensive experiments on Breast Ultrasound
Images (BUSI), International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC2017), Automated
Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) and PH$^2$ datasets. The experimental
results demonstrate that our method have achieved state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在三个无人机跟踪基准测试中，CGTrack实现了最先进的性能且运行速度快。

Conclusion: CGTrack通过创新的模块设计，有效提升了无人机跟踪的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in visual object tracking have markedly improved the
capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking, which is a critical
component in real-world robotics applications. While the integration of
hierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing
efficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network
capacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as
frequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these
issues, we introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which
combines explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a
coarse-to-fine framework. Specifically, we first introduce a Hierarchical
Feature Cascade (HFC) module that leverages the spirit of feature reuse to
increase network capacity by integrating the deep semantic cues with the rich
spatial information, incurring minimal computational costs while enhancing
feature representation. Based on this, we design a novel Lightweight Gated
Center Head (LGCH) that utilizes gating mechanisms to decouple target-oriented
coordinates from previously expanded features, which contain dense local
discriminative information. Extensive experiments on three challenging UAV
tracking benchmarks demonstrate that CGTrack achieves state-of-the-art
performance while running fast. Code will be available at

Result: TripSE显著提升了模型性能，ConvNeXt结合TripSE在FER2013数据集上达到78.27%的准确率，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: TripSE机制是一种有效的改进方法，尤其在ConvNeXt架构中表现优异，为CNN模型在视觉任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of ConvNeXt and its variants has reaffirmed the conceptual and
structural suitability of CNN-based models for vision tasks, re-establishing
them as key players in image classification in general, and in facial
expression recognition (FER) in particular. In this paper, we propose a new set
of models that build on these advancements by incorporating a new set of
attention mechanisms that combines Triplet attention with
Squeeze-and-Excitation (TripSE) in four different variants. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these variants by applying them to the ResNet18, DenseNet and
ConvNext architectures to validate their versatility and impact. Our study
shows that incorporating a TripSE block in these CNN models boosts their
performances, particularly for the ConvNeXt architecture, indicating its
utility. We evaluate the proposed mechanisms and associated models across four
datasets, namely CIFAR100, ImageNet, FER2013 and AffectNet datasets, where
ConvNext with TripSE achieves state-of-the-art results with an accuracy of
\textbf{78.27\%} on the popular FER2013 dataset, a new feat for this dataset.

Result: 在5个基准测试中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: Task-Adapter++有效解决了现有问题，性能优越，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language
and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the
application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of
few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer
from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of
task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic
order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing
cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal
information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient
dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make
full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design
a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most
discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction.
Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed
sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce
semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the
sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an
innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps
visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions.
Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5
benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at

Result: 在半合成和自然图像数据集上，该方法比现有基准产生更易理解的预测。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义区域稀疏化实现了更直观的可解释预测。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of machine learning models provides
valuable insights into the task, the data, and the reasons behind a model's
failures. In this work, we propose a method that performs inherently
interpretable predictions through the instance-wise sparsification of input
images. To align the sparsification with human perception, we learn the masking
in the space of semantically meaningful pixel regions rather than on
pixel-level. Additionally, we introduce an explicit way to dynamically
determine the required level of sparsity for each instance. We show empirically
on semi-synthetic and natural image datasets that our inherently interpretable
classifier produces more meaningful, human-understandable predictions than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Conclusion: SalmRec通过多任务协同优化，有效提升了文档图像矫正的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deformed document image rectification is essential for real-world document
understanding tasks, such as layout analysis and text recognition. However,
current multi-task methods -- such as background removal, 3D coordinate
prediction, and text line segmentation -- often overlook the complementary
features between tasks and their interactions. To address this gap, we propose
a self-adaptive learnable multi-task fusion rectification network named
SalmRec. This network incorporates an inter-task feature aggregation module
that adaptively improves the perception of geometric distortions, enhances
feature complementarity, and reduces negative interference. We also introduce a
gating mechanism to balance features both within global tasks and between local
tasks effectively. Experimental results on two English benchmarks (DIR300 and
DocUNet) and one Chinese benchmark (DocReal) demonstrate that our method
significantly improves rectification performance. Ablation studies further
highlight the positive impact of different tasks on dewarping and the
effectiveness of our proposed module.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了数据稀缺问题，为头影测量标志点检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cephalometric landmark detection is essential for orthodontic diagnostics and
treatment planning. Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection
and the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly
impeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted
the effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those
based on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have
developed an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse
cephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human
intervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new
cephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a
diffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond
closely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples
with different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray
image dataset. This dataset includes real cephalometric X-ray images and
detailed medical text prompts describing the images. By leveraging these
detailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control
different styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated
data, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric
landmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate
that training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance.
Compared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the
Success Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%. All code and

Conclusion: Siamese-Diffusion有效解决了合成数据质量不足的问题，为医学图像分割提供了更可靠的数据增强方法。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, yet its full
potential remains constrained by the paucity of annotated datasets. While
diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for generating synthetic
image-mask pairs to augment these datasets, they paradoxically suffer from the
same data scarcity challenges they aim to mitigate. Traditional mask-only
models frequently yield low-fidelity images due to their inability to
adequately capture morphological intricacies, which can critically compromise
the robustness and reliability of segmentation models. To alleviate this
limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model
comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion. During training, a Noise
Consistency Loss is introduced between these components to enhance the
morphological fidelity of Mask-Diffusion in the parameter space. During
sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.
Siamese-Diffusion boosts SANet's mDice and mIoU by 3.6% and 4.4% on the Polyps,
while UNet improves by 1.52% and 1.64% on the ISIC2018. Code is available at

Conclusion: PDIG通过结合稳定扩散和领域适配技术，有效解决了光伏缺陷数据稀缺问题，为智能制造提供了高质量数据增强方案。

Abstract: Accurate defect detection of photovoltaic (PV) cells is critical for ensuring
quality and efficiency in intelligent PV manufacturing systems. However, the
scarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model
training. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment
datasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain
shifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image
Generator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors
learned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited
data. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic Concept Embedding (SCE) module that
incorporates text-conditioned priors to capture the relational concepts between
defect types and their appearances. To further enrich the domain distribution,
we design a Lightweight Industrial Style Adaptor (LISA), which injects
industrial defect characteristics into the SD model through cross-disentangled
attention. At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC)
module, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency
and spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG
achieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Specifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16
points over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance
of downstream defect detection tasks.

Abstract: The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and
challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain
lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries
between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices
are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of
abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex.
Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on
single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information
commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire
brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective
integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a
holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of
data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in
detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on
external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some
extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed
a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for
brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following
features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and
integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM
encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling
Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features
even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3)
Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks
automatically without requiring manual prompts.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as clinical
assistants across various medical fields. However, specialized dermatology VLM
capable of delivering professional and detailed diagnostic analysis remains
underdeveloped, primarily due to less specialized text descriptions in current
dermatology multimodal datasets. To address this issue, we propose MM-Skin, the
first large-scale multimodal dermatology dataset that encompasses 3 imaging
modalities, including clinical, dermoscopic, and pathological and nearly 10k
high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional textbooks. In
addition, we generate over 27k diverse, instruction-following vision question
answering (VQA) samples (9 times the size of current largest dermatology VQA
dataset). Leveraging public datasets and MM-Skin, we developed SkinVL, a
dermatology-specific VLM designed for precise and nuanced skin disease
interpretation. Comprehensive benchmark evaluations of SkinVL on VQA,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffLocks是一种新框架，通过合成数据集和扩散变换模型，直接从单张图像生成详细的3D头发几何，解决了现有方法在多样发型和细节重建上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖合成数据且难以处理多样发型和卷发，缺乏真实数据支持。

Method: 1. 创建大规模合成头发数据集（40K发型）。2. 使用扩散变换模型从单张图像生成3D发丝，无需后处理。

Result: DiffLocks首次实现了从单张图像重建复杂发型（如非洲卷发），并支持广泛发型。

Conclusion: DiffLocks通过合成数据和扩散模型，显著提升了单图像3D头发重建的细节和多样性。

Abstract: We address the task of generating 3D hair geometry from a single image, which
is challenging due to the diversity of hairstyles and the lack of paired
image-to-3D hair data. Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data
and cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional
intermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings,
that require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These
approaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are
limited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we
propose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a
wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the
lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair
dataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic
hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that
generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a
pretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite
being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp
texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an
individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without
post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide
strands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of
complex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like
afro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time. Data and code is
available at https://radualexandru.github.io/difflocks/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管SAM在图像分割任务中表现出色，但其在医学图像分类中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用SAM编码器提取特征，结合SLCA机制计算空间局部注意力权重，增强分类模型对关键区域的关注。

Result: 在三个公开医学图像分类数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将SAM适配于医学图像分类，并通过SLCA机制显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have shown strong performance in various vision tasks, particularly
image segmentation, due to their impressive zero-shot segmentation
capabilities. However, effectively adapting such models for medical image
classification is still a less explored topic. In this paper, we introduce a
new framework to adapt SAM for medical image classification. First, we utilize
the SAM image encoder as a feature extractor to capture segmentation-based
features that convey important spatial and contextual details of the image,
while freezing its weights to avoid unnecessary overhead during training. Next,
we propose a novel Spatially Localized Channel Attention (SLCA) mechanism to
compute spatially localized attention weights for the feature maps. The
features extracted from SAM's image encoder are processed through SLCA to
compute attention weights, which are then integrated into deep learning
classification models to enhance their focus on spatially relevant or
meaningful regions of the image, thus improving classification performance.
Experimental results on three public medical image classification datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and data-efficiency of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VIN-NBV的新方法，通过预测视图对重建质量的直接改进来选择最佳视图，优于传统覆盖最大化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NBV算法依赖场景先验知识或额外图像捕获，且覆盖最大化策略在复杂场景中效果不佳。

Method: 提出View Introspection Network (VIN)，通过模仿学习预测视图的重建质量改进分数，并设计VIN-NBV策略进行贪婪采样。

Result: VIN-NBV在捕获次数或运动时间受限时，重建质量比覆盖最大化基线提高约30%。

Conclusion: VIN-NBV通过直接预测重建改进分数，显著提升了复杂场景下的3D重建效率和质量。

Abstract: Next Best View (NBV) algorithms aim to acquire an optimal set of images using
minimal resources, time, or number of captures to enable efficient 3D
reconstruction of a scene. Existing approaches often rely on prior scene
knowledge or additional image captures and often develop policies that maximize
coverage. Yet, for many real scenes with complex geometry and self-occlusions,
coverage maximization does not lead to better reconstruction quality directly.
In this paper, we propose the View Introspection Network (VIN), which is
trained to predict the reconstruction quality improvement of views directly,
and the VIN-NBV policy. A greedy sequential sampling-based policy, where at
each acquisition step, we sample multiple query views and choose the one with
the highest VIN predicted improvement score. We design the VIN to perform
3D-aware featurization of the reconstruction built from prior acquisitions, and
for each query view create a feature that can be decoded into an improvement
score. We then train the VIN using imitation learning to predict the
reconstruction improvement score. We show that VIN-NBV improves reconstruction
quality by ~30% over a coverage maximization baseline when operating with
constraints on the number of acquisitions or the time in motion.

TL;DR: 本文综述了AI安全评估的快速发展领域，提出了围绕三个维度的系统分类法：测量属性、测量方法及其在框架中的整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着前沿AI系统向变革性能力发展，需要改进评估方法以确保安全性和指导治理。

Method: 通过行为技术（如脚手架、红队测试和监督微调）和内部技术（如表示分析和机制可解释性）测量能力、倾向和控制。

Result: 展示了评估如何超越基准测试，测量模型的极限能力、默认行为倾向以及对抗性AI下的安全性。

Conclusion: 本文旨在为理解AI安全评估提供核心参考，同时指出挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: As frontier AI systems advance toward transformative capabilities, we need a
parallel transformation in how we measure and evaluate these systems to ensure
safety and inform governance. While benchmarks have been the primary method for
estimating model capabilities, they often fail to establish true upper bounds
or predict deployment behavior. This literature review consolidates the rapidly
evolving field of AI safety evaluations, proposing a systematic taxonomy around
three dimensions: what properties we measure, how we measure them, and how
these measurements integrate into frameworks. We show how evaluations go beyond
benchmarks by measuring what models can do when pushed to the limit
(capabilities), the behavioral tendencies exhibited by default (propensities),
and whether our safety measures remain effective even when faced with
subversive adversarial AI (control). These properties are measured through
behavioral techniques like scaffolding, red teaming and supervised fine-tuning,
alongside internal techniques such as representation analysis and mechanistic
interpretability. We provide deeper explanations of some safety-critical
capabilities like cybersecurity exploitation, deception, autonomous
replication, and situational awareness, alongside concerning propensities like
power-seeking and scheming. The review explores how these evaluation methods
integrate into governance frameworks to translate results into concrete
development decisions. We also highlight challenges to safety evaluations -
proving absence of capabilities, potential model sandbagging, and incentives
for "safetywashing" - while identifying promising research directions. By
synthesizing scattered resources, this literature review aims to provide a
central reference point for understanding AI safety evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的发展，从随机输出中稳健估计其能力并量化不确定性变得至关重要，同时高级AI评估具有复杂性和高成本。

Method: 基于广义线性模型（GLMs）、贝叶斯数据分析和正式模型比较，HiBayES提供不确定性量化和稳健参数估计。

Result: HiBayES在低数据场景（如每评估<20个数据点）中表现优异，并提供了软件包支持。

Conclusion: HiBayES为AI评估提供了一种通用且稳健的统计框架，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly
estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while
systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly
important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical
structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in
testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce
HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI
Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical
question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in
low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on
Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model
comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust
parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to
HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional
statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel
Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta
version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

Abstract: Drug resistance presents a major challenge in cancer therapy. Single cell
profiling offers insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet the application of
large-scale foundation models for predicting drug response in single cell data
remains underexplored. To address this, we developed scDrugMap, an integrated
framework featuring both a Python command-line interface and a web server for
drug response prediction. scDrugMap evaluates a wide range of foundation
models, including eight single-cell models and two large language models, using
a curated dataset of over 326,000 cells in the primary collection and 18,800
cells in the validation set, spanning 36 datasets and diverse tissue and cancer
types. We benchmarked model performance under pooled-data and cross-data
evaluation settings, employing both layer freezing and Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning strategies. In the pooled-data scenario, scFoundation
achieved the best performance, with mean F1 scores of 0.971 (layer freezing)
and 0.947 (fine-tuning), outperforming the lowest-performing model by over 50%.
In the cross-data setting, UCE excelled post fine-tuning (mean F1: 0.774),
while scGPT led in zero-shot learning (mean F1: 0.858). Overall, scDrugMap
provides the first large-scale benchmark of foundation models for drug response
prediction in single-cell data and serves as a user-friendly, flexible platform
for advancing drug discovery and translational research.

Motivation: 酶反应预测在生物催化等领域至关重要，但复杂且资源密集，LLMs因其泛化能力和上下文学习潜力成为研究焦点。

Method: 采用LoRA适配器进行参数高效微调，比较单任务和多任务学习策略，并评估不同数据量下的表现。

Result: 微调后的LLMs能捕捉生化知识，多任务学习通过共享酶信息提升合成预测性能，但在酶分类号预测上仍有局限。

Conclusion: LLMs在生化建模中潜力显著，但需进一步改进以应对复杂分类任务。

Abstract: Predicting enzymatic reactions is crucial for applications in biocatalysis,
metabolic engineering, and drug discovery, yet it remains a complex and
resource-intensive task. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated remarkable success in various scientific domains, e.g., through
their ability to generalize knowledge, reason over complex structures, and
leverage in-context learning strategies. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the capability of LLMs, particularly the Llama-3.1 family (8B and
70B), across three core biochemical tasks: Enzyme Commission number prediction,
forward synthesis, and retrosynthesis. We compare single-task and multitask
learning strategies, employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via LoRA
adapters. Additionally, we assess performance across different data regimes to
explore their adaptability in low-data settings. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuned LLMs capture biochemical knowledge, with multitask learning
enhancing forward- and retrosynthesis predictions by leveraging shared
enzymatic information. We also identify key limitations, for example challenges
in hierarchical EC classification schemes, highlighting areas for further
improvement in LLM-driven biochemical modeling.

Motivation: 现有少样本KGC方法主要关注关系信息，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的语义信息。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PromptMeta通过整合元语义和关系信息，提升了少样本KGC的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) has obtained significant attention
due to its practical applications in real-world scenarios, where new knowledge
often emerges with limited available data. While most existing methods for
few-shot KGC have predominantly focused on leveraging relational information,
rich semantics inherent in KGs have been largely overlooked. To address this
gap, we propose a novel prompted meta-learning (PromptMeta) framework that
seamlessly integrates meta-semantics with relational information for few-shot
KGC. PrompMeta has two key innovations: (1) a meta-semantic prompt pool that
captures and consolidates high-level meta-semantics, enabling effective
knowledge transfer and adaptation to rare and newly emerging relations. (2) a
learnable fusion prompt that dynamically combines meta-semantic information
with task-specific relational information tailored to different few-shot tasks.
Both components are optimized together with model parameters within a
meta-learning framework. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在D4RL、Robomimic和V-D4RL等基准测试中显著提升性能，仅用10%数据集即可超越标准算法的全数据集表现。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了离线强化学习的数据效率，适用于不同数据质量和分布。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy from a static
dataset without further interactions with the environment. Collecting
sufficiently large datasets for offline RL is exhausting since this data
collection requires colossus interactions with environments and becomes tricky
when the interaction with the environment is restricted. Hence, how an agent
learns the best policy with a minimal static dataset is a crucial issue in
offline RL, similar to the sample efficiency problem in online RL. In this
paper, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play pretraining method to
initialize a feature of a $Q$-network to enhance data efficiency in offline RL.
Specifically, we introduce a shared $Q$-network structure that outputs
predictions of the next state and $Q$-value. We pretrain the shared $Q$-network
through a supervised regression task that predicts a next state and trains the
shared $Q$-network using diverse offline RL methods. Through extensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our method enhances the
performance of existing popular offline RL methods on the D4RL, Robomimic and
V-D4RL benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our method significantly boosts
data-efficient offline RL across various data qualities and data distributions
trough D4RL and ExoRL benchmarks. Notably, our method adapted with only 10% of
the dataset outperforms standard algorithms even with full datasets.

Conclusion: APOLLO展示了编译器引导的LLM输出修复在自动定理证明中的高效性和正确性，为可扩展的自动推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Formal reasoning and automated theorem proving constitute a challenging
subfield of machine learning, in which machines are tasked with proving
mathematical theorems using formal languages like Lean. A formal verification
system can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost
instantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with large
language models (LLMs) remains a formidable task. The usual approach in the
literature is to prompt the LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one
of the generated proofs passes the verification system. In this work, we
present APOLLO (Automated PrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a
modular, model-agnostic pipeline that combines the strengths of the Lean
compiler with an LLM's reasoning abilities to achieve better proof-generation
results at a low sampling budget. Apollo directs a fully automated process in
which the LLM generates proofs for theorems, a set of agents analyze the
proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify the mistakes in the proofs using Lean,
isolate failing sub-lemmas, utilize automated solvers, and invoke an LLM on
each remaining goal with a low top-K budget. The repaired sub-proofs are
recombined and reverified, iterating up to a user-controlled maximum number of
attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we establish a new state-of-the-art
accuracy of 75.0% among 7B-parameter models while keeping the sampling budget
below one thousand. Moreover, Apollo raises the state-of-the-art accuracy for
Goedel-Prover-SFT to 65.6% while cutting sample complexity from 25,600 to a few
hundred. General-purpose models (o3-mini, o4-mini) jump from 3-7% to over 40%
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that targeted, compiler-guided repair of LLM
outputs yields dramatic gains in both efficiency and correctness, suggesting a
general paradigm for scalable automated theorem proving.

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern
companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace
events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation
problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the
corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that
frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract
Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event
interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations
for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where
event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this
reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy
computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to
suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.
However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of
manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing
Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with
reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a
data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the
candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is
refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior
knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by
experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings
where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent
constraints.

Result: 伪布尔编码显著优于基于CNF的现有方法，加速了复杂构造的处理。

Conclusion: 该方法缩短了表达性构造与可扩展自动推理之间的差距，且在基本构造上也具有竞争力。

Abstract: Configurable systems typically consist of reusable assets that have
dependencies between each other. To specify such dependencies, feature models
are commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated
reasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto
standard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to
enable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However,
modern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality
constraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between
the input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects
limits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we
shorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated
reasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean
encoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of
commonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a
novel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the
compiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already
used in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal
substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for
expressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different
feature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be
significantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall,
deriving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints
can be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach.
Furthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic
constructs.

Conclusion: ArtRAG通过结构化知识和检索增强生成，显著提升了艺术品解释的质量和文化丰富性。

Abstract: Understanding visual art requires reasoning across multiple perspectives --
cultural, historical, and stylistic -- beyond mere object recognition. While
recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) perform well on general image
captioning, they often fail to capture the nuanced interpretations that fine
art demands. We propose ArtRAG, a novel, training-free framework that combines
structured knowledge with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
multi-perspective artwork explanation. ArtRAG automatically constructs an Art
Context Knowledge Graph (ACKG) from domain-specific textual sources, organizing
entities such as artists, movements, themes, and historical events into a rich,
interpretable graph. At inference time, a multi-granular structured retriever
selects semantically and topologically relevant subgraphs to guide generation.
This enables MLLMs to produce contextually grounded, culturally informed art
descriptions. Experiments on the SemArt and Artpedia datasets show that ArtRAG
outperforms several heavily trained baselines. Human evaluations further
confirm that ArtRAG generates coherent, insightful, and culturally enriched
interpretations.

Abstract: Combining natural language and geometric shapes is an emerging research area
with multiple applications in robotics and language-assisted design. A crucial
task in this domain is object referent identification, which involves selecting
a 3D object given a textual description of the target. Variability in language
descriptions and spatial relationships of 3D objects makes this a complex task,
increasing the need to better understand the behavior of neural network models
in this domain. However, limited research has been conducted in this area.
Specifically, when a model makes an incorrect prediction despite being provided
with a seemingly correct object description, practitioners are left wondering:
"Why is the model wrong?". In this work, we present a method answering this
question by generating counterfactual examples. Our method takes a
misclassified sample, which includes two objects and a text description, and
generates an alternative yet similar formulation that would have resulted in a
correct prediction by the model. We have evaluated our approach with data from
the ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual
examples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically
similar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias
and enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help
practitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种发现事件序列中条件和无条件依赖关系的方法，通过生成形如$X \rightarrow Y$的规则，并结合最小描述长度原则优化规则集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略条件依赖，仅关注序列模式发现，无法全面描述事件序列关系。

Method: 提出Seqret方法，利用最小描述长度原则发现简洁且非冗余的规则集。

Result: 在合成数据集上能准确恢复真实依赖关系，在真实数据集中发现有用规则。

Conclusion: Seqret方法在发现事件序列依赖关系方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Summarizing event sequences is a key aspect of data mining. Most existing
methods neglect conditional dependencies and focus on discovering sequential
patterns only. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering both
conditional and unconditional dependencies from event sequence data. We do so
by discovering rules of the form $X \rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are
sequential patterns. Rules like these are simple to understand and provide a
clear description of the relation between the antecedent and the consequent. To
discover succinct and non-redundant sets of rules we formalize the problem in
terms of the Minimum Description Length principle. As the search space is
enormous and does not exhibit helpful structure, we propose the Seqret method
to discover high-quality rule sets in practice. Through extensive empirical
evaluation we show that unlike the state of the art, Seqret ably recovers the
ground truth on synthetic datasets and finds useful rules from real datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估Verilog训练的LLM生成受版权保护代码风险的基准，并发布了开源数据集FreeSet以减少侵权风险。通过微调框架训练的FreeV模型侵权率仅为3%，且功能优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有硬件设计任务的LLM微调数据集规模有限且缺乏版权检查，可能导致侵权问题。

Method: 提出评估基准和开源数据集FreeSet，采用自动化框架确保数据合法，并通过微调框架训练FreeV模型。

Result: FreeV侵权率仅3%，Verilog生成功能提升10%。

Conclusion: FreeSet和FreeV有效降低侵权风险并提升性能。

Abstract: Limitations in Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities for hardware design
tasks, such as generating functional Verilog codes, have motivated various
fine-tuning optimizations utilizing curated hardware datasets from open-source
repositories. However, these datasets remain limited in size and contain
minimal checks on licensing for reuse, resulting in potential copyright
violations by fine-tuned LLMs. Therefore, we propose an evaluation benchmark to
estimate the risk of Verilog-trained LLMs to generate copyright-protected
codes. To minimize this risk, we present an open-source Verilog dataset,
FreeSet, containing over 220k files, along with the automated dataset curation
framework utilized to provide additional guarantees of fair-use Verilog data.
We then execute an LLM fine-tuning framework consisting of continual
pre-training, resulting in a fine-tuned Llama model for Verilog, FreeV. Our
results indicate that FreeV demonstrates the smallest risk of
copyright-infringement among prior works, with only a 3% violation rate.
Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate improvements in Verilog
generation functionality over its baseline model, improving VerilogEval pass@10
rates by over 10%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念中心的智能体范式，结合神经符号概念实现持续学习和灵活推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能体在持续学习和跨领域任务中表现不足，需一种能高效学习和组合概念的方法。

Method: 利用神经符号概念（如对象、关系、动作），通过符号程序与神经网络结合表示，支持组合生成新概念。

Result: 智能体能在2D图像、视频、3D场景和机器人任务中高效学习和迁移概念。

Conclusion: 该框架具有数据高效、组合泛化、持续学习和零样本迁移的优势。

Abstract: This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can
learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a
vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object,
relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation
outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel
concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and
reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of
symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such
neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to
solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos,
3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework
offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional
generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的搜索空间缩减方法，用于解决神经组合优化（NCO）在大规模问题中的泛化挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NCO方法因计算复杂性和结构模式捕捉效率低，难以泛化至大规模问题。

Method: 通过动态选择有潜力的候选节点，减少搜索空间，同时保持解的质量。

Result: 方法在100节点实例上训练后，成功泛化至百万节点的TSP和CVRP问题。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了NCO在大规模问题中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Constructive neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has attracted growing
research attention due to its ability to solve complex routing problems without
relying on handcrafted rules. However, existing NCO methods face significant
challenges in generalizing to large-scale problems due to high computational
complexity and inefficient capture of structural patterns. To address this
issue, we propose a novel learning-based search space reduction method that
adaptively selects a small set of promising candidate nodes at each step of the
constructive NCO process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed
heuristics, our selection model dynamically prioritizes nodes based on learned
patterns, significantly reducing the search space while maintaining solution
quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained solely on
100-node instances from uniform distribution, generalizes remarkably well to
large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) instances with up to 1 million nodes from the uniform
distribution and over 80K nodes from other distributions.

TL;DR: 论文提出Continuous Thought Machine (CTM)，通过引入神经元级时间处理和同步机制，挑战深度学习忽略时间动态的范式，展示其在多任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑的神经活动具有复杂的时间动态性，而现有深度学习模型常忽略这一点。CTM旨在通过引入时间动态性，提升模型的生物合理性和性能。

Method: CTM包含两个核心创新：(1) 神经元级时间处理，每个神经元使用独特权重处理历史信号；(2) 神经同步作为潜在表示。

Result: CTM在ImageNet分类、迷宫求解、问答等任务中表现优异，支持自适应计算。

Conclusion: CTM是迈向更生物合理和强大AI系统的重要一步，但目标并非追求新SOTA，而是分享创新方法。

Abstract: Biological brains demonstrate complex neural activity, where the timing and
interplay between neurons is critical to how brains process information. Most
deep learning architectures simplify neural activity by abstracting away
temporal dynamics. In this paper we challenge that paradigm. By incorporating
neuron-level processing and synchronization, we can effectively reintroduce
neural timing as a foundational element. We present the Continuous Thought
Machine (CTM), a model designed to leverage neural dynamics as its core
representation. The CTM has two core innovations: (1) neuron-level temporal
processing, where each neuron uses unique weight parameters to process a
history of incoming signals; and (2) neural synchronization employed as a
latent representation. The CTM aims to strike a balance between oversimplified
neuron abstractions that improve computational efficiency, and biological
realism. It operates at a level of abstraction that effectively captures
essential temporal dynamics while remaining computationally tractable for deep
learning. We demonstrate the CTM's strong performance and versatility across a
range of challenging tasks, including ImageNet-1K classification, solving 2D
mazes, sorting, parity computation, question-answering, and RL tasks. Beyond
displaying rich internal representations and offering a natural avenue for
interpretation owing to its internal process, the CTM is able to perform tasks
that require complex sequential reasoning. The CTM can also leverage adaptive
compute, where it can stop earlier for simpler tasks, or keep computing when
faced with more challenging instances. The goal of this work is to share the
CTM and its associated innovations, rather than pushing for new
state-of-the-art results. To that end, we believe the CTM represents a
significant step toward developing more biologically plausible and powerful
artificial intelligence systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了强化学习在部分可观测流中导航的性能，发现常用算法（如Q-Learning、AAC）表现不佳，而PPO算法表现优异，接近理论最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习在流体流动导航中的实际性能，以解决自主机器人和浮游生物的导航问题。

Method: 引入一个方向导航问题，对比Q-Learning、AAC和PPO算法在多种流场（如Taylor-Green涡流、ABC流和二维湍流）中的表现。

Result: PPO算法表现最佳，接近理论最优解，而其他算法表现较差。

Conclusion: 算法选择、实现细节和参数调优对复杂流中智能导航策略至关重要。

Abstract: Navigating in a fluid flow while being carried by it, using only information
accessible from on-board sensors, is a problem commonly faced by small
planktonic organisms. It is also directly relevant to autonomous robots
deployed in the oceans. In the last ten years, the fluid mechanics community
has widely adopted reinforcement learning, often in the form of its simplest
implementations, to address this challenge. But it is unclear how good are the
strategies learned by these algorithms. In this paper, we perform a
quantitative assessment of reinforcement learning methods applied to navigation
in partially observable flows. We first introduce a well-posed problem of
directional navigation for which a quasi-optimal policy is known analytically.
We then report on the poor performance and robustness of commonly used
algorithms (Q-Learning, Advantage Actor Critic) in flows regularly encountered
in the literature: Taylor-Green vortices, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, and
two-dimensional turbulence. We show that they are vastly surpassed by PPO
(Proximal Policy Optimization), a more advanced algorithm that has established
dominance across a wide range of benchmarks in the reinforcement learning
community. In particular, our custom implementation of PPO matches the
theoretical quasi-optimal performance in turbulent flow and does so in a robust
manner. Reaching this result required the use of several additional techniques,
such as vectorized environments and generalized advantage estimation, as well
as hyperparameter optimization. This study demonstrates the importance of
algorithm selection, implementation details, and fine-tuning for discovering
truly smart autonomous navigation strategies in complex flows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ADMM的新型SNN训练方法，解决了传统反向传播算法的可扩展性和数值精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在时间序列处理中潜力巨大但缺乏高效训练算法，传统反向传播方法存在可扩展性和数值精度不足的问题。

Method: 采用交替方向乘子法（ADMM）解决SNN阶跃函数的不可微性问题，并推导闭式更新公式。

Result: 实验证明该方法具有收敛性、潜力和改进空间。

Conclusion: ADMM为SNN训练提供了新思路，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to
their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy
consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training
algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from
stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks
when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low
scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN
training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step
function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form
updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great
potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a
simulated proof-of-concept.

Abstract: With unprecedented rapid development, deep neural networks (DNNs) have deeply
influenced almost all fields. However, their heavy computation costs and model
sizes are usually unacceptable in real-world deployment. Model quantization, an
effective weight-lighting technique, has become an indispensable procedure in
the whole deployment pipeline. The essence of quantization acceleration is the
conversion from continuous floating-point numbers to discrete integer ones,
which significantly speeds up the memory I/O and calculation, i.e., addition
and multiplication. However, performance degradation also comes with the
conversion because of the loss of precision. Therefore, it has become
increasingly popular and critical to investigate how to perform the conversion
and how to compensate for the information loss. This article surveys the recent
five-year progress towards low-bit quantization on DNNs. We discuss and compare
the state-of-the-art quantization methods and classify them into 8 main
categories and 24 sub-categories according to their core techniques.
Furthermore, we shed light on the potential research opportunities in the field
of model quantization. A curated list of model quantization is provided at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的图对比学习框架RELGCL，通过保留图结构中的相对相似性模式，解决了传统方法在离散、非欧几里得图数据中的语义破坏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图对比学习（GCL）方法在计算机视觉中表现良好，但在图数据中因生成视图破坏语义和相似性验证不可靠而面临挑战。

Method: 通过分析11个真实图数据，发现标签一致性随结构距离增加而衰减的普遍模式，并基于随机游走理论建立理论保证。提出RELGCL框架，通过成对和列表式实现保留相对相似性。

Result: RELGCL在20种现有方法中表现最优，验证了利用自然相对相似性优于人工绝对相似性的有效性。

Conclusion: 图数据天然编码相对相似性模式，RELGCL通过保留这些模式显著提升了图对比学习的性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has achieved remarkable success by following
the computer vision paradigm of preserving absolute similarity between
augmented views. However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs
due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks
semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through
analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending
the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically
diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in
homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish
theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving
label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind
different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode
relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit
collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we
propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise
implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective
similarity objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms 20 existing approaches across both homophily and
heterophily graphs, validating the effectiveness of leveraging natural relative
similarity over artificial absolute similarity.

Motivation: 现有ECG分类方法难以同时捕捉局部形态细节和长程时间依赖关系，Cardioformer旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用跨通道分块、分层残差学习和两阶段自注意力机制，编码多尺度令牌嵌入以捕获局部和全局特征。

Result: 在三个基准ECG数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别为96.34（MIMIC-IV）、89.99（PTB-XL）和95.59（PTB），优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Cardioformer在自动化ECG分析中具有潜力，为更准确和稳健的心血管疾病诊断铺平道路。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is crucial for automated cardiac
disease diagnosis, yet existing methods often struggle to capture local
morphological details and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. To
address these challenges, we propose Cardioformer, a novel multi-granularity
hybrid model that integrates cross-channel patching, hierarchical residual
learning, and a two-stage self-attention mechanism. Cardioformer first encodes
multi-scale token embeddings to capture fine-grained local features and global
contextual information and then selectively fuses these representations through
intra- and inter-granularity self-attention. Extensive evaluations on three
benchmark ECG datasets under subject-independent settings demonstrate that
model consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines. Our
Cardioformer model achieves the AUROC of 96.34$\pm$0.11, 89.99$\pm$0.12, and
95.59$\pm$1.66 in MIMIC-IV, PTB-XL and PTB dataset respectively outperforming
PatchTST, Reformer, Transformer, and Medformer models. It also demonstrates
strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving 49.18% AUROC on PTB and 68.41%
on PTB-XL when trained on MIMIC-IV. These findings underscore the potential of
Cardioformer to advance automated ECG analysis, paving the way for more
accurate and robust cardiovascular disease diagnosis. We release the source

Conclusion: Griffin展示了作为通用关系数据库基础模型的潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed
specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models
focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder
to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by
incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes
pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders
for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative
components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural
networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on
large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across
various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates
superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in
low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and
diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its
potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs. Code available

Abstract: Existing biomedical benchmarks do not provide end-to-end infrastructure for
training, evaluation, and inference of models that integrate multimodal
biological data and a broad range of machine learning tasks in therapeutics. We
present PyTDC, an open-source machine-learning platform providing streamlined
training, evaluation, and inference software for multimodal biological AI

sources and model weights and standardizes benchmarking and inference
endpoints. This paper discusses the components of PyTDC's architecture and, to
our knowledge, the first-of-its-kind case study on the introduced single-cell
drug-target nomination ML task. We find state-of-the-art methods in graph
representation learning and domain-specific methods from graph theory perform
poorly on this task. Though we find a context-aware geometric deep learning
method that outperforms the evaluated SoTA and domain-specific baseline
methods, the model is unable to generalize to unseen cell types or incorporate
additional modalities, highlighting PyTDC's capacity to facilitate an exciting
avenue of research developing multimodal, context-aware, foundation models for
open problems in biomedical AI.

Conclusion: 研究表明，算法设计者通过预见策略行为，可以设计出既公平又能激励改进的分类器。

Abstract: As machine learning algorithms increasingly influence critical decision
making in different application areas, understanding human strategic behavior
in response to these systems becomes vital. We explore individuals' choice
between genuinely improving their qualifications (``improvement'') vs.
attempting to deceive the algorithm by manipulating their features
(``manipulation'') in response to an algorithmic decision system. We further
investigate an algorithm designer's ability to shape these strategic responses,
and its fairness implications. Specifically, we formulate these interactions as
a Stackelberg game, where a firm deploys a (fair) classifier, and individuals
strategically respond. Our model incorporates both different costs and
stochastic efficacy for manipulation and improvement. The analysis reveals
different potential classes of agent responses, and characterizes optimal
classifiers accordingly. Based on these, we highlight the impact of the firm's
anticipation of strategic behavior, identifying when and why a (fair) strategic
policy can not only prevent manipulation, but also incentivize agents to opt
for improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化原型解释，有效提升了用户理解与模型性能。

Abstract: Although prototype-based explanations provide a human-understandable way of
representing model predictions they often fail to direct user attention to the
most relevant features. We propose a novel approach to identify the most
informative features within prototypes, termed alike parts. Using feature
importance scores derived from an agnostic explanation method, it emphasizes
the most relevant overlapping features between an instance and its nearest
prototype. Furthermore, the feature importance score is incorporated into the
objective function of the prototype selection algorithms to promote global
prototypes diversity. Through experiments on six benchmark datasets, we
demonstrate that the proposed approach improves user comprehension while
maintaining or even increasing predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning for conversion prediction has found widespread applications in
online advertising. These models have become more complex as they are trained
to jointly predict multiple objectives such as click, add-to-cart, checkout and
other conversion types. Additionally, the capacity and performance of these
models can often be increased with the use of embedding tables that encode high
cardinality categorical features such as advertiser, user, campaign, and
product identifiers (IDs). These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also
learned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model
objectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient
sparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform
distribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make
training prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch.
Previous works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger
feature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs,
regularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding
tables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at
the expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively. In this
paper, we share key learnings from the development of embedding table
optimization and multi-epoch training in Pinterest Ads Conversion models. We
showcase how our Sparse Optimizer speeds up convergence, and how multi-epoch
overfitting varies in severity between different objectives in a multi-task
model depending on label sparsity. We propose a new approach to deal with
multi-epoch overfitting: the use of a frequency-adaptive learning rate on the
embedding tables and compare it to embedding re-initialization. We evaluate
both methods offline using an industrial large-scale production dataset.

Abstract: In performative Reinforcement Learning (RL), an agent faces a
policy-dependent environment: the reward and transition functions depend on the
agent's policy. Prior work on performative RL has studied the convergence of
repeated retraining approaches to a performatively stable policy. In the finite
sample regime, these approaches repeatedly solve for a saddle point of a
convex-concave objective, which estimates the Lagrangian of a regularized
version of the reinforcement learning problem. In this paper, we aim to extend
such repeated retraining approaches, enabling them to operate under corrupted
data. More specifically, we consider Huber's $\epsilon$-contamination model,
where an $\epsilon$ fraction of data points is corrupted by arbitrary
adversarial noise. We propose a repeated retraining approach based on
convex-concave optimization under corrupted gradients and a novel
problem-specific robust mean estimator for the gradients. We prove that our
approach exhibits last-iterate convergence to an approximately stable policy,
with the approximation error linear in $\sqrt{\epsilon}$. We experimentally
demonstrate the importance of accounting for corruption in performative RL.

Conclusion: SPIN-ODE为神经网络与详细化学结合开辟了新方向，是首个针对刚度问题的神经ODE研究。

Abstract: Estimating rate constants from complex chemical reactions is essential for
advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world
atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training
instability and poor convergence that hinder effective rate constant estimation
using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff
Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction
modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a
latent neural ODE learns the continuous and differentiable trajectory between
chemical concentrations and their time derivatives; second, an explicit
Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) extracts the underlying rate
coefficients based on the learned dynamics; and third, fine-tune CRNN using a
neural ODE solver to further improve rate coefficient estimation. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate
the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work on stiff
Neural ODEs for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising
directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EquiHGNN的等变超图神经网络框架，用于建模分子系统中的高阶相互作用，并通过对称性约束提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的模型仅能捕捉成对相互作用，无法充分描述分子系统中的高阶关系，因此需要一种能够建模多向相互作用的框架。

Method: EquiHGNN通过引入对称性感知表示，保持几何和拓扑特性，设计了多种等变架构，并在大规模分子数据集上验证其性能。

Result: 实验表明，高阶相互作用对小分子效果有限，但对大分子显著优于传统2D图模型；加入几何特征后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: EquiHGNN通过结合高阶相互作用和对称性约束，为分子建模提供了更鲁棒且物理意义明确的表示。

Abstract: Molecular interactions often involve high-order relationships that cannot be
fully captured by traditional graph-based models limited to pairwise
connections. Hypergraphs naturally extend graphs by enabling multi-way
interactions, making them well-suited for modeling complex molecular systems.
In this work, we introduce EquiHGNN, an Equivariant HyperGraph Neural Network
framework that integrates symmetry-aware representations to improve molecular
modeling. By enforcing the equivariance under relevant transformation groups,
our approach preserves geometric and topological properties, leading to more
robust and physically meaningful representations. We examine a range of
equivariant architectures and demonstrate that integrating symmetry constraints
leads to notable performance gains on large-scale molecular datasets.
Experiments on both small and large molecules show that high-order interactions
offer limited benefits for small molecules but consistently outperform 2D
graphs on larger ones. Adding geometric features to these high-order structures
further improves the performance, emphasizing the value of spatial information
in molecular learning. Our source code is available at

*Winston Chen,Trenton Chang,Jenna Wiens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在非依从性情况下，条件前门调整（CFD）比标准后门调整（SBD）能提供更低方差的治疗效果估计，并提出了一种多任务神经网络LobsterNet来优化CFD的实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非依从性情况下，现有方法（如SBD和CFD）的估计方差差异未被充分研究，尤其是当治疗效果较小时。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析比较CFD与SBD的方差，并提出LobsterNet（一种多任务神经网络）来联合建模CFD中的多个干扰参数。

Result: CFD在治疗效果较小时方差更低；LobsterNet在半合成和真实数据集上减少了估计误差。

Conclusion: CFD结合共享干扰参数建模（如LobsterNet）可改善非依从性下的治疗效果估计。

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment
decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to
their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the
conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the
treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these
approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the
literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD
yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment
assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in
patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple
nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that
implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically,
LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and
real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared
nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation
under non-adherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超图中缺乏固有的邻接关系和方向系统，导致构建任意度的层拉普拉斯算子存在根本性挑战。

Method: 利用从超图直接导出的对称单纯集，编码超边内所有可能的定向子关系为有序元组，定义邻接关系并保留超边来源。

Result: 提出的HNSD方法在实验中表现出竞争力，验证了其数学一致性和结构保留能力。

Conclusion: HNSD是首个将Neural Sheaf Diffusion扩展到超图的原理性方法，解决了方向模糊性和邻接稀疏性问题。

Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in
hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of
arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial
sets derived directly from hypergraphs, which encode all possible oriented
subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction
canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving
hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf
Laplacian on our induced symmetric simplicial set reduces exactly to the
traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs,
validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory.
Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from
the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is
faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural
Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of Neural Sheaf
Diffusion (NSD) to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf
Laplacians over symmetric simplicial sets, resolving orientation ambiguity and
adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate HNSD's competitive performance across established benchmarks.

Conclusion: 差分隐私在保护隐私的同时，对算法集体行动的效果提出了挑战，需平衡隐私保护与用户影响力。

Abstract: The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention
and excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms
and re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment
of trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to
realize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and
evaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a
possibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its
behavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the
data they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor.
This paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with
methods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model
trustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm
deploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory
focus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of
Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the
collective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that
while differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it
introduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We
characterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under
differential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's
privacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating
collective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across
several datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DDMs在生成任务中表现出色，但其高效表征学习能力不足，因此需要探索如何利用DDMs进行更广泛的深度学习应用。

Method: 采用多级去噪自编码器框架，引入时序一致的扩散变换器和时间步依赖编码器，通过自条件扩散学习在去噪马尔可夫链上获取嵌入表示。

Result: 实验表明，DDMs学习的最优嵌入在大多数情况下优于当前最先进的自监督表征学习方法，具有显著的判别性语义表征质量。

Conclusion: DDMs不仅适用于生成任务，还可能对通用深度学习应用具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Generative models capture the true distribution of data, yielding
semantically rich representations. Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) exhibit
superior generative capabilities, though efficient representation learning for
them are lacking. In this work, we employ a multi-level denoising autoencoder
framework to expand the representation capacity of DDMs, which introduces
sequentially consistent Diffusion Transformers and an additional
timestep-dependent encoder to acquire embedding representations on the
denoising Markov chain through self-conditional diffusion learning.
Intuitively, the encoder, conditioned on the entire diffusion process,
compresses high-dimensional data into directional vectors in latent under
different noise levels, facilitating the learning of image embeddings across
all timesteps. To verify the semantic adequacy of embeddings generated through
this approach, extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets,
demonstrating that optimally learned embeddings by DDMs surpass
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning methods in most cases,
achieving remarkable discriminative semantic representation quality. Our work
justifies that DDMs are not only suitable for generative tasks, but also
potentially advantageous for general-purpose deep learning applications.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种新型多变量时间序列预测方法，通过离线聚类提取原型，简化长程依赖建模，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于Transformer的模型）计算复杂度高，难以高效捕捉长程依赖和实体间交互。

Method: FOCUS通过离线聚类提取原型，在线阶段动态适配输入段与高层事件间的依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，FOCUS在保持高精度的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: FOCUS为高效且准确的多变量时间序列预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is
essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction,
which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions
between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer
architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to
a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the
input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline
Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that
simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes
extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level
events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key
characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS
dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures
dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both
accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the
offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of
modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: 该算法在理论和实验上均表现出色，为两层网络的实证风险最小化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces the first globally optimal algorithm for the empirical
risk minimization problem of two-layer maxout and ReLU networks, i.e.,
minimizing the number of misclassifications. The algorithm has a worst-case
time complexity of $O\left(N^{DK+1}\right)$, where $K$ denotes the number of
hidden neurons and $D$ represents the number of features. It can be can be
generalized to accommodate arbitrary computable loss functions without
affecting its computational complexity. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm provides provably exact solutions for small-scale datasets.
To handle larger datasets, we introduce a novel coreset selection method that
reduces the data size to a manageable scale, making it feasible for our
algorithm. This extension enables efficient processing of large-scale datasets
and achieves significantly improved performance, with a 20-30\% reduction in
misclassifications for both training and prediction, compared to
state-of-the-art approaches (neural networks trained using gradient descent and
support vector machines), when applied to the same models (two-layer networks
with fixed hidden nodes and linear models).

Result: 实验显示平均准确率提升5.31%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了资源、选择和可解释性问题，提升了表格预测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in solving complex
tasks, making them a promising tool for enhancing tabular learning. However,
existing LLM-based methods suffer from high resource requirements, suboptimal
demonstration selection, and limited interpretability, which largely hinder
their prediction performance and application in the real world. To overcome
these problems, we propose a novel in-context learning framework for tabular
prediction. The core idea is to leverage the explanations generated by LLMs to
guide a smaller, locally deployable Surrogate Language Model (SLM) to make
interpretable tabular predictions. Specifically, our framework mainly involves
three stages: (i) Post Hoc Explanation Generation, where LLMs are utilized to
generate explanations for question-answer pairs in candidate demonstrations,
providing insights into the reasoning behind the answer. (ii) Post Hoc
Explanation-Guided Demonstrations Selection, which utilizes explanations
generated by LLMs to guide the process of demonstration selection from
candidate demonstrations. (iii) Post Hoc Explanation-Guided Interpretable SLM
Prediction, which utilizes the demonstrations obtained in step (ii) as
in-context and merges corresponding explanations as rationales to improve the
performance of SLM and guide the model to generate interpretable outputs.
Experimental results highlight the framework's effectiveness, with an average
accuracy improvement of 5.31% across various tabular datasets in diverse
domains.

dominant predictors; and (3) the BioMCD dataset, a large-scale benchmark with

<details>

Motivation: 现有图OOD方法依赖不变拓扑或谱假设，可能与实际场景不符，因此需要更灵活的表示不变知识的方法。

Method: 采用可学习随机游走视角，参数化转移矩阵，并使用KDE-based MI损失生成符合OOD原则的随机游走序列。

Result: 实验表明，LRW-OOD在多种分布偏移下显著提升泛化性能，准确率比现有方法高3.87%。

Conclusion: LRW-OOD为图OOD泛化提供了一种有效且灵活的方法，验证了可学习随机游走的实用性。

Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for
machine learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit
performance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing graph OOD methods
tend to follow the basic ideas of invariant risk minimization and structural
causal models, interpreting the invariant knowledge across datasets under
various distribution shifts as graph topology or graph spectrum. However, these
interpretations may be inconsistent with real-world scenarios, as neither
invariant topology nor spectrum is assured. In this paper, we advocate the
learnable random walk (LRW) perspective as the instantiation of invariant
knowledge, and propose LRW-OOD to realize graph OOD generalization learning.
Instead of employing fixed probability transition matrix (i.e.,
degree-normalized adjacency matrix), we parameterize the transition matrix with
an LRW-sampler and a path encoder. Furthermore, we propose the kernel density
estimation (KDE)-based mutual information (MI) loss to generate random walk
sequences that adhere to OOD principles. Extensive experiment demonstrates that
our model can effectively enhance graph OOD generalization under various types
of distribution shifts and yield a significant accuracy improvement of 3.87%
over state-of-the-art graph OOD generalization baselines.

Result: MxMoE在2.25-bit下比GPTQ降低2.4的Wikitext-2困惑度，速度比全精度快3.4倍，比均匀量化快29.4%。

Conclusion: MxMoE通过混合精度优化显著提升了MoE模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face deployment challenges due to their large
parameter counts and computational demands. We explore quantization for MoE
models and highlight two key insights: 1) linear blocks exhibit varying
quantization sensitivity, and 2) divergent expert activation frequencies create
heterogeneous computational characteristics. Based on these observations, we
introduce MxMoE, a mixed-precision optimization framework for MoE models that
considers both algorithmic and system perspectives. MxMoE navigates the design
space defined by parameter sensitivity, expert activation dynamics, and
hardware resources to derive efficient mixed-precision configurations.
Additionally, MxMoE automatically generates optimized mixed-precision GroupGEMM
kernels, enabling parallel execution of GEMMs with different precisions.
Evaluations show that MxMoE outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.4 lower
Wikitext-2 perplexity than GPTQ at 2.25-bit and delivering up to 3.4x speedup
over full precision, as well as up to 29.4% speedup over uniform quantization
at equivalent accuracy with 5-bit weight-activation quantization. Our code is

Abstract: The state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for
ensuring the safe and reliable operation of electric vehicles. Nevertheless,
the prevailing SOH estimation methods often have limited generalizability. This
paper introduces a data-driven approach for estimating the SOH of LIBs, which
is designed to improve generalization. We construct a hybrid model named ACLA,
which integrates the attention mechanism, convolutional neural network (CNN),
and long short-term memory network (LSTM) into the augmented neural ordinary

time corresponding to specific voltages in the constant current charging phase
as input and outputs the SOH as well as remaining useful of life. The model is
trained on NASA and Oxford datasets and validated on the TJU and HUST datasets.
Compared to the benchmark models NODE and ANODE, ACLA exhibits higher accuracy
with root mean square errors (RMSE) for SOH estimation as low as 1.01% and
2.24% on the TJU and HUST datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: BCE在多类任务中表现优异，能有效优化特征学习，代码将公开。

Abstract: When training classification models, it expects that the learned features are
compact within classes, and can well separate different classes. As the
dominant loss function for training classification models, minimizing
cross-entropy (CE) loss maximizes the compactness and distinctiveness, i.e.,
reaching neural collapse (NC). The recent works show that binary CE (BCE)
performs also well in multi-class tasks. In this paper, we compare BCE and CE
in deep feature learning. For the first time, we prove that BCE can also
maximize the intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness when
reaching its minimum, i.e., leading to NC. We point out that CE measures the
relative values of decision scores in the model training, implicitly enhancing
the feature properties by classifying samples one-by-one. In contrast, BCE
measures the absolute values of decision scores and adjust the
positive/negative decision scores across all samples to uniformly high/low
levels. Meanwhile, the classifier biases in BCE present a substantial
constraint on the decision scores to explicitly enhance the feature properties
in the training. The experimental results are aligned with above analysis, and
show that BCE could improve the classification and leads to better compactness
and distinctiveness among sample features. The codes will be released.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the problem of learning junta distributions on $\{0, 1\}^n$, where a
distribution is a $k$-junta if its probability mass function depends on a
subset of at most $k$ variables. We make two main contributions:
  - We show that learning $k$-junta distributions is \emph{computationally}
equivalent to learning $k$-parity functions with noise (LPN), a landmark
problem in computational learning theory.
  - We design an algorithm for learning junta distributions whose statistical
complexity is optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors. Computationally, our
algorithm matches the complexity of previous (non-sample-optimal) algorithms.
  Combined, our two contributions imply that our algorithm cannot be
significantly improved, statistically or computationally, barring a
breakthrough for LPN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 机器学习（ML）在多个领域取得成功，但其部署引发公平性、透明性等问题。混合整数优化（MIO）为构建负责任ML提供框架。本文介绍MIO的理论与实践，探讨其应用及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ML在敏感和关键领域的广泛应用，公平性、透明性等问题日益突出，需要开发负责任的方法。

Method: 利用混合整数优化（MIO）框架，将负责任ML原则直接嵌入学习过程，同时保持性能。

Result: MIO能构建透明模型并满足公平性等约束，提供实用工具和策略。

Conclusion: MIO是负责任ML的有效工具，但仍有局限性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: In the last few decades, Machine Learning (ML) has achieved significant
success across domains ranging from healthcare, sustainability, and the social
sciences, to criminal justice and finance. But its deployment in increasingly
sophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups
they belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around
fairness, transparency, robustness, and privacy, among others. As the
complexity and scale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are
deployed grow, so does the need for responsible ML methods that address these
challenges while providing guaranteed performance in deployment.
  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding
responsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while
maintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently
transparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain
specific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and
comprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and
practical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML,
their importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building
ML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical
formulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for
efficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML. It concludes with a
discussion on current limitations and open research questions, providing
suggestions for future work.

*Changkun Ye,Russell Tsuchida,Lars Petersson,Nick Barnes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种估计开放集标签偏移（OSLS）的方法，通过三个阶段估计源和目标标签分布，并量化误差，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集标签偏移（OSLS）是标签分布从源分布到目标分布变化且目标分布包含额外OOD类的问题，需要有效估计方法。

Method: 使用源域ID分类器和ID/OOD分类器构建估计器，分三个阶段：1）估计源标签分布的OOD类；2）EM算法估计目标标签分布的MLE；3）在宽松假设下估计目标OOD类分布。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多种OSLS设置下有效，且无需重新训练即可校正分类器。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效估计OSLS问题中的标签分布，并通过实验验证了其性能。

Abstract: Open set label shift (OSLS) occurs when label distributions change from a
source to a target distribution, and the target distribution has an additional
out-of-distribution (OOD) class. In this work, we build estimators for both
source and target open set label distributions using a source domain
in-distribution (ID) classifier and an ID/OOD classifier. With reasonable
assumptions on the ID/OOD classifier, the estimators are assembled into a
sequence of three stages: 1) an estimate of the source label distribution of
the OOD class, 2) an EM algorithm for Maximum Likelihood estimates (MLE) of the
target label distribution, and 3) an estimate of the target label distribution
of OOD class under relaxed assumptions on the OOD classifier. The sampling
errors of estimates in 1) and 3) are quantified with a concentration
inequality. The estimation result allows us to correct the ID classifier
trained on the source distribution to the target distribution without
retraining. Experiments on a variety of open set label shift settings
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ChangkunYe/OpenSetLabelShift.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中基于虚假相关性（捷径）的决策机制，提出了一种检测和缓解捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何内部处理捷径，以改进模型的决策透明性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用电影评论中的演员名称作为可控捷径，通过机制解释方法识别相关注意力头，并开发了基于头的标记归因（HTA）方法。

Result: 发现特定注意力头会提前基于捷径做出决策，HTA能有效检测捷径并选择性缓解。

Conclusion: HTA为理解和改进语言模型的决策机制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reliance on spurious correlations (shortcuts) has been shown to underlie many
of the successes of language models. Previous work focused on identifying the
input elements that impact prediction. We investigate how shortcuts are
actually processed within the model's decision-making mechanism. We use actor
names in movie reviews as controllable shortcuts with known impact on the
outcome. We use mechanistic interpretability methods and identify specific
attention heads that focus on shortcuts. These heads gear the model towards a
label before processing the complete input, effectively making premature
decisions that bypass contextual analysis. Based on these findings, we
introduce Head-based Token Attribution (HTA), which traces intermediate
decisions back to input tokens. We show that HTA is effective in detecting
shortcuts in LLMs and enables targeted mitigation by selectively deactivating
shortcut-related attention heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯粹的数据驱动方法在平衡搜索空间和优化效率方面存在困难，因此需要一种结合已有知识的方法来改进PDE的发现过程。

Method: 将已知PDE编码为句子结构，训练生成模型EqGPT，并通过生成-评估-优化的循环自主识别最佳PDE。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能高效准确地恢复多种PDE形式，尤其在复杂时空导数或空间项的情况下优于传统方法，并能推广到不规则空间域和高维场景。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能发现已知PDE，还能揭示新的PDE（如非线性表面重力波方程），展示了其在科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: Data driven discovery of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a promising
approach for uncovering the underlying laws governing complex systems. However,
purely data driven techniques face the dilemma of balancing search space with
optimization efficiency. This study introduces a knowledge guided approach that
incorporates existing PDEs documented in a mathematical handbook to facilitate
the discovery process. These PDEs are encoded as sentence like structures
composed of operators and basic terms, and used to train a generative model,
called EqGPT, which enables the generation of free form PDEs. A loop of
generation evaluation optimization is constructed to autonomously identify the
most suitable PDE. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework can
recover a variety of PDE forms with high accuracy and computational efficiency,
particularly in cases involving complex temporal derivatives or intricate
spatial terms, which are often beyond the reach of conventional methods. The
approach also exhibits generalizability to irregular spatial domains and higher
dimensional settings. Notably, it succeeds in discovering a previously
unreported PDE governing strongly nonlinear surface gravity waves propagating
toward breaking, based on real world experimental data, highlighting its
applicability to practical scenarios and its potential to support scientific
discovery.

Conclusion: DiffDecip通过结合保守信息，显著提升了分子优化的效果。

Abstract: Generating molecules that bind to specific protein targets via diffusion
models has shown good promise for structure-based drug design and molecule
optimization. Especially, the diffusion models with binding interaction
guidance enables molecule generation with high affinity through forming
favorable interaction within protein pocket. However, the generated molecules
may not form interactions with the highly conserved residues, which are
important for protein functions and bioactivities of the ligands. Herein, we
developed a new 3D target-aware diffusion model DiffDecip, which explicitly
incorporates the protein-ligand binding interactions and evolutionary
conservation information of protein residues into both diffusion and sampling
process, for molecule optimization through scaffold decoration. The model
performance revealed that DiffDecip outperforms baseline model DiffDec on
molecule optimization towards higher affinity through forming more non-covalent
interactions with highly conserved residues in the protein pocket.

Motivation: 现有多模态方法直接融合不同模态信息，忽略了模态间交互潜力，未能充分捕捉分子间复杂高阶关系和不变特征。

Method: MMSA框架包含多模态分子表示学习模块和结构感知模块，前者处理多模态信息生成统一嵌入，后者通过超图结构建模分子间高阶相关性并引入记忆机制整合不变知识。

Result: 在MoleculeNet基准测试中，MMSA表现优异，ROC-AUC平均提升1.8%至9.6%。

Conclusion: MMSA通过结构感知和多模态交互显著提升了分子表示学习能力，为药物发现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate extraction of molecular representations is a critical step in the
drug discovery process. In recent years, significant progress has been made in
molecular representation learning methods, among which multi-modal molecular
representation methods based on images, and 2D/3D topologies have become
increasingly mainstream. However, existing these multi-modal approaches often
directly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential
of intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex
higher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal
self-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed
to enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge
between molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal
molecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module.
The multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively
processes information from different modalities of the same molecule to
overcome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding.
Subsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular
representation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order
correlations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism
for storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory
anchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving
the model generalization ability. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the
effectiveness of MMSA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
MoleculeNet benchmark, with average ROC-AUC improvements ranging from 1.8% to
9.6% over baseline methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为IRNN的新型RNN架构，通过引入Kalman滤波中的'创新'概念，利用过去的预测误差提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据包含丰富的动态信息，而现有的RNN方法未能充分利用这些信息。通过借鉴Kalman滤波的'创新'概念，作者希望提升RNN的预测能力。

Method: 提出了IRNN架构，将预测误差作为额外输入信号更新隐藏状态，并设计了IU-BPTT训练算法，交替更新创新数据和优化网络参数。

Result: 实验表明，IRNN在多种RNN形式上显著提升了预测精度，且未显著增加训练成本。

Conclusion: IRNN通过引入创新概念，有效提升了时间序列预测性能，为动态建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are time series that are sequentially collected and
contain rich temporal information. Thus, a common interest in practice is to
capture dynamics of time series and predict their future evolutions. To this
end, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been a prevalent and effective
machine learning option, which admits a nonlinear state-space model
representation. Motivated by the resemblance between RNN and Kalman filter (KF)
for linear state-space models, we propose in this paper Innovation-driven RNN
(IRNN), a novel RNN architecture tailored to time-series data modeling and
prediction tasks. By adapting the concept of "innovation" from KF to RNN, past
prediction errors are adopted as additional input signals to update hidden
states of RNN and boost prediction performance. Since innovation data depend on
network parameters, existing training algorithms for RNN do not apply to IRNN
straightforwardly. Thus, a tailored training algorithm dubbed input
updating-based back-propagation through time (IU-BPTT) is further proposed,
which alternates between updating innovations and optimizing network parameters
via gradient descent. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that
the integration of innovations into various forms of RNN leads to remarkably
improved prediction accuracy of IRNN without increasing the training cost
substantially.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中任务混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，降低内存和计算复杂度。

Method: 使用HAE作为压缩器，结合判别和生成建模，采用能量最小化方程和排斥力算法优化新类中心分布。

Result: AHR在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，内存需求降至O(0.1t)。

Conclusion: AHR策略在性能和资源效率上均优于现有方法，适合大规模类增量学习。

Abstract: In class-incremental learning (CIL), effective incremental learning
strategies are essential to mitigate task confusion and catastrophic
forgetting, especially as the number of tasks $t$ increases. Current exemplar
replay strategies impose $\mathcal{O}(t)$ memory/compute complexities. We
propose an autoencoder-based hybrid replay (AHR) strategy that leverages our
new hybrid autoencoder (HAE) to function as a compressor to alleviate the
requirement for large memory, achieving $\mathcal{O}(0.1 t)$ at the worst case
with the computing complexity of $\mathcal{O}(t)$ while accomplishing
state-of-the-art performance. The decoder later recovers the exemplar data
stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is
designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling
classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged
particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for
the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent
space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent
baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same
memory/compute budgets. The source code is included in the supplementary
material and will be open-sourced upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型的广泛应用，内存受限设备上的高效推理需求日益增长，但现有方法因PCIe带宽限制难以满足低延迟场景需求。

Method: FloE利用专家参数矩阵的冗余性，采用多种压缩技术减少数据传输，并结合低成本稀疏预测，实现高效推理。

Result: 在Mixtral-8x7B上，FloE实现了9.3倍的专家参数压缩，内存占用减少8.5倍，推理速度提升48.7倍。

Conclusion: FloE为内存受限设备上的MoE推理提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, there is a
growing demand for efficient inference on memory-constrained devices. While
offloading expert parameters to CPU memory and loading activated experts on
demand has emerged as a potential solution, the large size of activated experts
overburdens the limited PCIe bandwidth, hindering the effectiveness in
latency-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this, we propose FloE, an on-the-fly
MoE inference system on memory-constrained GPUs. FloE is built on the insight
that there exists substantial untapped redundancy within sparsely activated
experts. It employs various compression techniques on the expert's internal
parameter matrices to reduce the data movement load, combined with low-cost
sparse prediction, achieving perceptible inference acceleration in wall-clock
time on resource-constrained devices. Empirically, FloE achieves a 9.3x
compression of parameters per expert in Mixtral-8x7B; enables deployment on a
GPU with only 11GB VRAM, reducing the memory footprint by up to 8.5x; and
delivers a 48.7x inference speedup compared to DeepSpeed-MII on a single
GeForce RTX 3090.

Conclusion: 该框架在6G工厂子网络中实现了高效的自主学习和优化，为未来高密度网络提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range
communication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios,
effective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference
resulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to
power control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane,
often overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has
typically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of
complete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available
at the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to
autonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory
Subnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy
optimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages.
The simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces
signaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that
lags the ideal "Genie" approach by only 5%.

Result: 在连续控制任务中表现优异，性能提升26.3%。

Conclusion: 新方法为离线协调和多智能体系统均衡选择提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces critical challenges
due to distributional shifts, further exacerbated by the high dimensionality of
joint action spaces and the diversity in coordination strategies and quality
among agents. Conventional approaches, including independent learning
frameworks and value decomposition methods based on pessimistic principles,
remain susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) joint actions and often yield
suboptimal performance. Through systematic analysis of prevalent offline MARL
benchmarks, we identify that this limitation primarily stems from the
inherently multimodal nature of joint collaborative policies induced by offline
data collection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage
framework: First, we employ a diffusion-based generative model to explicitly
capture the complex behavior policy, enabling accurate modeling of diverse
multi-agent coordination patterns. Second, we introduce a sequential score
function decomposition mechanism to regularize individual policies and enable
decentralized execution. Extensive experiments on continuous control tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple standard offline MARL
benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 26.3\% in normalized returns. Our
approach provides new insights into offline coordination and equilibrium
selection in cooperative multi-agent systems.

Abstract: This work presents an efficient decoding pipeline for neuromorphic
implantable brain-machine interfaces (Neu-iBMI), leveraging sparse neural event
data from an event-based neural sensing scheme. We introduce a tunable event
filter (EvFilter), which also functions as a spike detector (EvFilter-SPD),
significantly reducing the number of events processed for decoding by 192X and
554X, respectively. The proposed pipeline achieves high decoding performance,
up to R^2=0.73, with ANN- and SNN-based decoders, eliminating the need for
signal recovery, spike detection, or sorting, commonly performed in
conventional iBMI systems. The SNN-Decoder reduces computations and memory
required by 5-23X compared to NN-, and LSTM-Decoders, while the ST-NN-Decoder
delivers similar performance to an LSTM-Decoder requiring 2.5X fewer resources.
This streamlined approach significantly reduces computational and memory

Abstract: As recommender systems become increasingly complex, transparency is essential
to increase user trust, accountability, and regulatory compliance.
Neuro-symbolic approaches that integrate symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic
learning offer a promising approach toward transparent and user-centric
systems. In this work-in-progress, we investigate using fuzzy neural networks
(FNNs) as a neuro-symbolic approach for recommendations that learn logic-based
rules over predefined, human-readable atoms. Each rule corresponds to a fuzzy
logic expression, making the recommender's decision process inherently
transparent. In contrast to black-box machine learning methods, our approach
reveals the reasoning behind a recommendation while maintaining competitive
performance. We evaluate our method on a synthetic and MovieLens 1M datasets
and compare it to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Our results
demonstrate that our approach accurately captures user behavior while providing
a transparent decision-making process. Finally, the differentiable nature of
this approach facilitates an integration with other neural models, enabling the
development of hybrid, transparent recommender systems.

Conclusion: Adaptive-UCS通过自适应规则表示机制，显著提升了分类性能，适用于复杂和不确定的数据环境。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the impact of rule representation in Michigan-style
Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) on its classification performance. A
well-representation of the rules in an LFCS is crucial for improving its
performance. However, conventional rule representations frequently need help
addressing problems with unknown data characteristics. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a supervised LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS) with a self-adaptive
rule representation mechanism, entitled Adaptive-UCS. Adaptive-UCS incorporates
a fuzzy indicator as a new rule parameter that sets the membership function of
a rule as either rectangular (i.e., crisp) or triangular (i.e., fuzzy) shapes.
The fuzzy indicator is optimized with evolutionary operators, allowing the
system to search for an optimal rule representation. Results from extensive
experiments conducted on continuous space problems demonstrate that
Adaptive-UCS outperforms other UCSs with conventional crisp-hyperrectangular
and fuzzy-hypertrapezoidal rule representations in classification accuracy.
Additionally, Adaptive-UCS exhibits robustness in the case of noisy inputs and
real-world problems with inherent uncertainty, such as missing values, leading
to stable classification performance.

*Qian Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对深度Q网络（DQN）的通用逼近定理（UAT），其架构设计模拟了贝尔曼更新中的迭代细化过程，揭示了网络深度与值函数迭代之间的直接联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用逼近定理（UAT）未充分利用最优Q函数的结构特性，本文旨在填补这一空白，通过设计特定架构的DQN来模拟贝尔曼更新的迭代过程。

Method: 利用反向随机微分方程（BSDE）理论和有限时域动态规划原理，分析贝尔曼算子的规律性，并通过深度残差网络层近似贝尔曼算子的作用。

Result: 证明了网络深度与值函数迭代次数的直接对应关系，并实现了误差传播的可控性。

Conclusion: 本文为控制问题的结构提供了一种新的逼近定理，揭示了网络在值函数空间上的动态系统视角。

Abstract: The approximation capabilities of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) are commonly
justified by general Universal Approximation Theorems (UATs) that do not
leverage the intrinsic structural properties of the optimal Q-function, the
solution to a Bellman equation. This paper establishes a UAT for a class of
DQNs whose architecture is designed to emulate the iterative refinement process
inherent in Bellman updates. A central element of our analysis is the
propagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman
operator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic
Differential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform
regularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically,
their uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz
assumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic
programming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network,
conceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the
action of the Bellman operator. The resulting approximation theorem is thus
intrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof
technique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value
function refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation. This
perspective reveals a dynamic systems view of the network's operation on a
space of value functions.

Abstract: Irregular temporal data, characterized by varying recording frequencies,
differing observation durations, and missing values, presents significant
challenges across fields like mobility, healthcare, and environmental science.
Existing research communities often overlook or address these challenges in
isolation, leading to fragmented tools and methods. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a unified framework, and the first standardized dataset repository
for irregular time series classification, built on a common array format to
enhance interoperability. This repository comprises 34 datasets on which we
benchmark 12 classifier models from diverse domains and communities. This work
aims to centralize research efforts and enable a more robust evaluation of
irregular temporal data analysis methods.

Motivation: 联邦学习中高维模型更新导致通信瓶颈，现有压缩方法（如Top-K）可能影响性能，而误差反馈（EF）在非平滑问题和安全性约束下的应用受限。

Method: 提出Safe-EF算法，匹配非平滑凸优化下的理论下界，并扩展到随机设置，支持安全性约束。

Result: 实验验证了Safe-EF在分布式人形机器人训练中的有效性，确保安全性并降低通信复杂度。

Conclusion: Safe-EF填补了理论与实践的鸿沟，为联邦学习中的通信压缩和安全性约束提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning faces severe communication bottlenecks due to the high
dimensionality of model updates. Communication compression with contractive
compressors (e.g., Top-K) is often preferable in practice but can degrade
performance without proper handling. Error feedback (EF) mitigates such issues
but has been largely restricted for smooth, unconstrained problems, limiting
its real-world applicability where non-smooth objectives and safety constraints
are critical. We advance our understanding of EF in the canonical non-smooth
convex setting by establishing new lower complexity bounds for first-order
algorithms with contractive compression. Next, we propose Safe-EF, a novel
algorithm that matches our lower bound (up to a constant) while enforcing
safety constraints essential for practical applications. Extending our approach
to the stochastic setting, we bridge the gap between theory and practical
implementation. Extensive experiments in a reinforcement learning setup,
simulating distributed humanoid robot training, validate the effectiveness of
Safe-EF in ensuring safety and reducing communication complexity.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated methodology for fault detection in wind
turbine blades using 3D-printed scaled models, finite element simulations,
experimental modal analysis, and machine learning techniques. A scaled model of
the NREL 5MW blade was fabricated using 3D printing, and crack-type damages
were introduced at critical locations. Finite Element Analysis was employed to
predict the impact of these damages on the natural frequencies, with the
results validated through controlled hammer impact tests. Vibration data was
processed to extract both time-domain and frequency-domain features, and key
discriminative variables were identified using statistical analyses (ANOVA).
Machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest
Neighbors, achieved classification accuracies exceeding 94%. The results
revealed that vibration modes 3, 4, and 6 are particularly sensitive to
structural anomalies for this blade. This integrated approach confirms the
feasibility of combining numerical simulations with experimental validations
and paves the way for structural health monitoring systems in wind energy

Result: 该方法在真实和合成数据集上的表现与扩散映射和Nystrom方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习方法有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提高了计算效率和适用性。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems within the field of machine learning is
dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction methods make it possible to
combat the so-called curse of dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data
and, in general, improve the efficiency of storing and processing large data
sets. One of the best-known nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods is
Diffusion Maps. However, despite their virtues, both Diffusion Maps and many
other manifold learning methods based on the spectral decomposition of kernel
matrices have drawbacks such as the inability to apply them to data outside the
initial set, their computational complexity, and high memory costs for large
data sets. In this work, we propose to alleviate these problems by resorting to
deep learning. Specifically, a new formulation of Diffusion Maps embedding is
offered as a solution to a certain unconstrained minimization problem and,
based on it, a cost function to train a neural network which computes Diffusion
Maps embedding -- both inside and outside the training sample -- without the
need to perform any spectral decomposition. The capabilities of this approach
are compared on different data sets, both real and synthetic, with those of
Diffusion Maps and the Nystrom method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归算法在复杂树结构下性能受限，现有符号网络存在二元运算符无法自然扩展为多元运算符以及固定架构导致过拟合的问题。

Method: 将二元运算符统一为嵌套一元运算符，预训练Transformer模型以指导结构选择，并采用目标优化策略学习网络参数。

Result: UniSymNet在拟合精度、符号解率和表达式复杂度方面表现优异，在低维标准基准和高维SRBench上均具竞争力。

Conclusion: UniSymNet通过统一运算符和优化结构选择，显著提升了符号回归的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a powerful technique for automatically
discovering mathematical expressions from input data. Mainstream SR algorithms
search for the optimal symbolic tree in a vast function space, but the
increasing complexity of the tree structure limits their performance. Inspired
by neural networks, symbolic networks have emerged as a promising new paradigm.
However, most existing symbolic networks still face certain challenges: binary
nonlinear operators $\{\times, \div\}$ cannot be naturally extended to
multivariate operators, and training with fixed architecture often leads to
higher complexity and overfitting. In this work, we propose a Unified Symbolic
Network that unifies nonlinear binary operators into nested unary operators and
define the conditions under which UniSymNet can reduce complexity. Moreover, we
pre-train a Transformer model with a novel label encoding method to guide
structural selection, and adopt objective-specific optimization strategies to
learn the parameters of the symbolic network. UniSymNet shows high fitting
accuracy, excellent symbolic solution rate, and relatively low expression
complexity, achieving competitive performance on low-dimensional Standard
Benchmarks and high-dimensional SRBench.

Method: 对2022年11月至2025年4月发布的模型进行10次独立运行测试，覆盖分子生物学、遗传学等8个领域。

Result: 模型性能大幅提升，部分测试中表现优于专家；某些基准测试出现性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需开发更复杂的评估方法以适应AI技术的快速发展。

Abstract: This study systematically evaluates 27 frontier Large Language Models on
eight diverse biology benchmarks spanning molecular biology, genetics, cloning,
virology, and biosecurity. Models from major AI developers released between
November 2022 and April 2025 were assessed through ten independent runs per
benchmark. The findings reveal dramatic improvements in biological
capabilities. Top model performance increased more than 4-fold on the
challenging text-only subset of the Virology Capabilities Test over the study
period, with the top model now performing twice as well as expert virologists.
Several models now match or exceed expert-level performance on other
challenging benchmarks, including LAB-Bench CloningScenarios and the biology
subsets of GPQA and WMDP. Contrary to expectations, chain-of-thought did not
substantially improve performance over zero-shot evaluation, while extended
reasoning features in o3-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet typically improved
performance as predicted by inference scaling. Benchmarks such as PubMedQA and
the MMLU and WMDP biology subsets exhibited performance plateaus well below
100%, suggesting benchmark saturation and errors in the underlying benchmark
data. The analysis highlights the need for more sophisticated evaluation
methodologies as AI systems continue to advance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类在多个领域至关重要，但领域偏移问题显著影响分类性能。现有方法（如实例归一化）在回归任务中有效，但在分类任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出FIC-TSC框架，利用Fisher信息作为约束，引导模型收敛至更平坦的极小值，增强对分布偏移的泛化能力。

Result: 在30个UEA多变量和85个UCR单变量数据集上验证，FIC-TSC优于14种最新方法。

Conclusion: FIC-TSC通过Fisher信息约束有效解决了领域偏移问题，显著提升了时间序列分类的泛化性能。

Abstract: Analyzing time series data is crucial to a wide spectrum of applications,
including economics, online marketplaces, and human healthcare. In particular,
time series classification plays an indispensable role in segmenting different
phases in stock markets, predicting customer behavior, and classifying worker
actions and engagement levels. These aspects contribute significantly to the
advancement of automated decision-making and system optimization in real-world
applications. However, there is a large consensus that time series data often
suffers from domain shifts between training and test sets, which dramatically
degrades the classification performance. Despite the success of (reversible)
instance normalization in handling the domain shifts for time series regression
tasks, its performance in classification is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we
propose \textit{FIC-TSC}, a training framework for time series classification
that leverages Fisher information as the constraint. We theoretically and
empirically show this is an efficient and effective solution to guide the model
converge toward flatter minima, which enhances its generalizability to
distribution shifts. We rigorously evaluate our method on 30 UEA multivariate
and 85 UCR univariate datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over 14 recent state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单纯计算Wasserstein距离或分析其传输图不足以理解影响距离高低的因素。

Method: 基于可解释AI的方法，将Wasserstein距离归因到数据子组、输入特征或可解释子空间。

Result: 方法在多样数据集和Wasserstein距离规格下表现高精度，并在两个用例中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解Wasserstein距离的贡献因素提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances provide a powerful framework for comparing data
distributions. They can be used to analyze processes over time or to detect
inhomogeneities within data. However, simply calculating the Wasserstein
distance or analyzing the corresponding transport map (or coupling) may not be
sufficient for understanding what factors contribute to a high or low
Wasserstein distance. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on
Explainable AI that allows us to efficiently and accurately attribute
Wasserstein distances to various data components, including data subgroups,
input features, or interpretable subspaces. Our method achieves high accuracy
across diverse datasets and Wasserstein distance specifications, and its
practical utility is demonstrated in two use cases.

Result: 测试显示，该方法显著增加了预测错误和碰撞率，并暴露了模型的关键弱点，如无法检测潜在碰撞。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更全面的对抗测试，以更好地评估和改进自动驾驶轨迹预测模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a key element of autonomous vehicle systems,
enabling them to anticipate and react to the movements of other road users.
Evaluating the robustness of prediction models against adversarial attacks is
essential to ensure their reliability in real-world traffic. However, current
approaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding
agents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical
vulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of
model performance in real-world conditions.
  In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future
states of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and
thereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel
approach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors,
enabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new
performance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial
trajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model
revealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under
adversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks
can expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect
potential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions. These results
underscore the need for more comprehensive adversarial testing to better
evaluate and improve the reliability of trajectory prediction models for
autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: 揭示了ReLU$^+$和ICNN在表达能力上的局限性，为神经网络设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study two models of ReLU neural networks: monotone networks (ReLU$^+$) and
input convex neural networks (ICNN). Our focus is on expressivity, mostly in
terms of depth, and we prove the following lower bounds. For the maximum
function MAX$_n$ computing the maximum of $n$ real numbers, we show that
ReLU$^+$ networks cannot compute MAX$_n$, or even approximate it. We prove a
sharp $n$ lower bound on the ICNN depth complexity of MAX$_n$. We also prove
depth separations between ReLU networks and ICNNs; for every $k$, there is a
depth-2 ReLU network of size $O(k^2)$ that cannot be simulated by a depth-$k$
ICNN. The proofs are based on deep connections between neural networks and
polyhedral geometry, and also use isoperimetric properties of triangulations.

Motivation: CVRPTW是一个经典的NP难问题，传统方法难以应对其复杂性。LLM的发展为解决此类问题提供了新思路。

Method: 采用LLM增强的Q学习框架，包括自适应两阶段训练（LLM引导探索和自主优化）和三层次自校正机制（语法验证、语义验证和物理约束强制执行）。

Result: 实验结果表明，与传统Q学习相比，该框架平均降低了7.3%的成本，且收敛所需的训练步骤更少。

Conclusion: LLM增强的Q学习框架为CVRPTW问题提供了高效且可靠的解决方案，展示了LLM在组合优化问题中的潜力。

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
classic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics
distribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the
constraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant
challenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This
paper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW
with real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive
two-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration
phase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability,
we design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical
constraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the
experience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the
architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a
7.3\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer
training steps required for convergence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method MTL-Swin-Unet which is multi-task learning using
transformers for classification and semantic segmentation. For
spurious-correlation problems, this method allows us to enhance the image
representation with two other image representations: representation obtained by
semantic segmentation and representation obtained by image reconstruction. In
our experiments, the proposed method outperformed in F-value measure than other
classifiers when the test data included slices from the same patient (no
covariate shift). Similarly, when the test data did not include slices from the
same patient (covariate shift setting), the proposed method outperformed in AUC
measure.

Abstract: In modern data-driven tasks such as classification, optimization, and
forecasting, mitigating the effects of intrinsic noise is crucial for improving
predictive accuracy. While numerous denoising techniques have been developed,
the rising dimensionality of real-world datasets limits conventional
matrix-based methods in preserving data structure and accuracy. This challenge
has led to increasing interest in tensor-based approaches, which naturally
capture multi-way data relationships. However, classical tensor decomposition
methods (e.g., HOSVD, HOOI) typically require pre-specified ranks and iterative
optimization, making them computationally expensive and less practical. In this
work, we propose a novel low-rank approximation method for tensor data that
avoids these limitations. Our approach applies statistically grounded singular
value thresholding to mode-wise matricizations, enabling automatic extraction
of significant components without requiring prior rank specification or
iterative refinement. Experiments on synthetic and real-world tensors show that
our method consistently outperforms existing techniques in terms of estimation
accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in noisy high-dimensional
settings.

Conclusion: 强调了全面评估表示的重要性，为理解和改进模型表示提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Downstream probing has been the dominant method for evaluating model
representations, an important process given the increasing prominence of
self-supervised learning and foundation models. However, downstream probing
primarily assesses the availability of task-relevant information in the model's
latent space, overlooking attributes such as equivariance, invariance, and
disentanglement, which contribute to the interpretability, adaptability, and
utility of representations in real-world applications. While some attempts have
been made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation
framework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.
  In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation
beyond downstream probing. We introduce a standardized protocol to quantify
informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement of factors of
variation in model representations. We use it to evaluate representations from
a variety of models in the image and speech domains using different
architectures and pretraining approaches on identified controllable factors of
variation. We find that representations from models with similar downstream
performance can behave substantially differently with regard to these
attributes. This hints that the respective mechanisms underlying their
downstream performance are functionally different, prompting new research
directions to understand and improve representations.

Conclusion: 模型成功展示了词汇和物种的多样性演化，验证了LLM在进化生态研究中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a model for the evolutionary ecology of words as one attempt to
extend evolutionary game theory and agent-based models by utilizing the rich
linguistic expressions of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our model enables the
emergence and evolution of diverse and infinite options for interactions among
agents. Within the population, each agent possesses a short word (or phrase)
generated by an LLM and moves within a spatial environment. When agents become
adjacent, the outcome of their interaction is determined by the LLM based on
the relationship between their words, with the loser's word being replaced by
the winner's. Word mutations, also based on LLM outputs, may occur. We
conducted preliminary experiments assuming that ``strong animal species" would
survive. The results showed that from an initial population consisting of
well-known species, many species emerged both gradually and in a punctuated
equilibrium manner. Each trial demonstrated the unique evolution of diverse
populations, with one type of large species becoming dominant, such as
terrestrial animals, marine life, or extinct species, which were ecologically
specialized and adapted ones across diverse extreme habitats. We also conducted
a long-term experiment with a large population, demonstrating the emergence and
coexistence of diverse species.

Abstract: Microgrids have emerged as a pivotal solution in the quest for a sustainable
and energy-efficient future. While microgrids offer numerous advantages, they
are also prone to issues related to reliably forecasting renewable energy
demand and production, protecting against cyberattacks, controlling operational
costs, optimizing power flow, and regulating the performance of energy
management systems (EMS). Tackling these energy management challenges is
essential to facilitate microgrid applications and seamlessly incorporate
renewable energy resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently
demonstrated immense potential for optimizing energy management in microgrids,
providing efficient and reliable solutions. This paper highlights the combined
benefits of enabling AI-based methodologies in the energy management systems of
microgrids by examining the applicability and efficiency of AI-based EMS in
achieving specific technical and economic objectives. The paper also points out
several future research directions that promise to spearhead AI-driven EMS,
namely the development of self-healing microgrids, integration with blockchain
technology, use of Internet of things (IoT), and addressing interpretability,
data privacy, scalability, and the prospects to generative AI in the context of
future AI-based EMS.

Method: 结合用户实时反馈和强化学习，动态优化HVAC性能，无需预设信息。

Result: 模拟显示该方法显著降低能耗成本，同时保持或提升用户舒适度。

Conclusion: 该框架为HVAC系统提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，平衡了个人偏好与经济环境目标。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for
approximately 38% of building energy consumption globally, making them one of
the most energy-intensive services. The increasing emphasis on energy
efficiency and sustainability, combined with the need for enhanced occupant
comfort, presents a significant challenge for traditional HVAC systems. These
systems often fail to dynamically adjust to real-time changes in electricity
market rates or individual comfort preferences, leading to increased energy
costs and reduced comfort. In response, we propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Artificial Intelligence framework that optimizes HVAC performance by
incorporating real-time user feedback and responding to fluctuating electricity
prices. Unlike conventional systems that require predefined information about
occupancy or comfort levels, our approach learns and adapts based on ongoing
user input. By integrating the occupancy prediction model with reinforcement
learning, the system improves operational efficiency and reduces energy costs
in line with electricity market dynamics, thereby contributing to demand
response initiatives. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method
achieves significant cost reductions compared to baseline approaches while
maintaining or enhancing occupant comfort. This feedback-driven approach
ensures personalized comfort control without the need for predefined settings,
offering a scalable solution that balances individual preferences with economic
and environmental goals.

Motivation: 随着序列学习算法在现实生活中的广泛应用，如何在保证数据隐私的同时维持算法效用成为一个重要问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的信息论量来刻画DP在随机老虎机中的难度，并设计了两种DP版本的渐近最优算法（DP-KLUCB和DP-IMED）。

Result: 证明了新的遗憾下界严格优于现有结果，并展示了算法的遗憾渐近匹配下界。

Conclusion: 研究否定了在全局DP下必须遗忘过去奖励的猜想，并提出了一种新的DP版本Chernoff界。

Abstract: As sequential learning algorithms are increasingly applied to real life,
ensuring data privacy while maintaining their utilities emerges as a timely
question. In this context, regret minimisation in stochastic bandits under
$\epsilon$-global Differential Privacy (DP) has been widely studied. Unlike
bandits without DP, there is a significant gap between the best-known regret
lower and upper bound in this setting, though they "match" in order. Thus, we
revisit the regret lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$-global DP algorithms
for Bernoulli bandits and improve both. First, we prove a tighter regret lower
bound involving a novel information-theoretic quantity characterising the
hardness of $\epsilon$-global DP in stochastic bandits. Our lower bound
strictly improves on the existing ones across all $\epsilon$ values. Then, we
choose two asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms, i.e. DP-KLUCB and DP-IMED,
and propose their DP versions using a unified blueprint, i.e., (a) running in
arm-dependent phases, and (b) adding Laplace noise to achieve privacy. For
Bernoulli bandits, we analyse the regrets of these algorithms and show that
their regrets asymptotically match our lower bound up to a constant arbitrary
close to 1. This refutes the conjecture that forgetting past rewards is
necessary to design optimal bandit algorithms under global DP. At the core of
our algorithms lies a new concentration inequality for sums of Bernoulli
variables under Laplace mechanism, which is a new DP version of the Chernoff
bound. This result is universally useful as the DP literature commonly treats
the concentrations of Laplace noise and random variables separately, while we
couple them to yield a tighter bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高频交易模型依赖历史数据，假设未来市场状态相似，但在动态、多变且波动性强的实际市场中表现有限。

Method: 提出FlowHFT框架，结合流匹配策略和网格搜索微调，从多个专家模型中学习并适应不同市场条件。

Result: FlowHFT在多种市场环境中表现优于单一专家模型，适应性强且性能稳定。

Conclusion: FlowHFT为高频交易提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于复杂多变的市场环境。

Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously
monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds.
Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that
future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of
any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally,
these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions,
such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow,
and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic,
diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the
FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy.
FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each
proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can
adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market
state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism.
This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in
complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal.
We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow
matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling
FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably,
our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best
expert for each market condition.

Motivation: 现有Transformer模型复杂度高，且缺乏对不同退化现象共性的研究。本文旨在通过多域视角识别共性先验，并设计高效框架。

Method: 提出Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier多域结构替代自注意力，并在前馈网络中引入多尺度学习，融合多域特征。

Result: 在十项恢复任务中表现优于现有方法，平衡了性能、参数量、计算成本和推理延迟。

Conclusion: SWFormer通过多域学习显著提升了图像恢复效果，为复杂退化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Due to adverse atmospheric and imaging conditions, natural images suffer from
various degradation phenomena. Consequently, image restoration has emerged as a
key solution and garnered substantial attention. Although recent Transformer
architectures have demonstrated impressive success across various restoration
tasks, their considerable model complexity poses significant challenges for
both training and real-time deployment. Furthermore, instead of investigating
the commonalities among different degradations, most existing restoration
methods focus on modifying Transformer under limited restoration priors. In
this work, we first review various degradation phenomena under multi-domain
perspective, identifying common priors. Then, we introduce a novel restoration
framework, which integrates multi-domain learning into Transformer.
Specifically, in Token Mixer, we propose a Spatial-Wavelet-Fourier multi-domain
structure that facilitates local-region-global multi-receptive field modeling
to replace vanilla self-attention. Additionally, in Feed-Forward Network, we
incorporate multi-scale learning to fuse multi-domain features at different
resolutions. Comprehensive experimental results across ten restoration tasks,
such as dehazing, desnowing, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, rain
streak/raindrop removal, cloud removal, shadow removal, underwater enhancement
and low-light enhancement, demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves a favorable trade-off among restoration
performance, parameter size, computational cost and inference latency. The code

TL;DR: StereoINR提出了一种新的立体图像超分辨率方法，通过隐式神经表示和跨视图机制，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和多尺度上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立体超分辨率方法缺乏跨视图几何一致性和固定尺度限制，难以自适应利用多视图信息。

Method: 提出StereoINR，将立体图像对建模为连续隐式表示，结合空间扭曲和跨注意力机制实现跨视图信息融合。

Result: 实验表明，StereoINR在训练分布内外尺度上均表现优异，几何一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: StereoINR为立体超分辨率提供了统一且高效的解决方案，突破了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Stereo image super-resolution (SSR) aims to enhance high-resolution details
by leveraging information from stereo image pairs. However, existing stereo
super-resolution (SSR) upsampling methods (e.g., pixel shuffle) often overlook
cross-view geometric consistency and are limited to fixed-scale upsampling. The
key issue is that previous upsampling methods use convolution to independently
process deep features of different views, lacking cross-view and non-local
information perception, making it difficult to select beneficial information
from multi-view scenes adaptively. In this work, we propose Stereo Implicit
Neural Representation (StereoINR), which innovatively models stereo image pairs
as continuous implicit representations. This continuous representation breaks
through the scale limitations, providing a unified solution for arbitrary-scale
stereo super-resolution reconstruction of left-right views. Furthermore, by
incorporating spatial warping and cross-attention mechanisms, StereoINR enables
effective cross-view information fusion and achieves significant improvements
in pixel-level geometric consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple
datasets show that StereoINR outperforms out-of-training-distribution scale
upsampling and matches state-of-the-art SSR methods within
training-distribution scales.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种AI驱动的跟踪模型，用于在心脏内超声（ICE）中持续跟踪治疗设备尖端，结合临床和合成数据增强模型鲁棒性，实验结果显示角度误差较小，为实时机器人ICE导管控制奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在心脏电生理和结构性心脏病干预中，手动ICE导管操作需要频繁调整，难以持续可视化治疗设备尖端，因此需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用混合数据集生成策略，结合临床ICE序列和合成数据增强；模型架构基于预训练的超声基础模型和基于Transformer的网络，利用历史数据提高预测精度。

Conclusion: 该AI框架为实时机器人ICE导管调整奠定了基础，未来将扩展临床数据集以进一步提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a critical role in
Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by
providing real-time visualization of intracardiac structures. However,
maintaining continuous visibility of the therapy device tip remains a challenge
due to frequent adjustments required during manual ICE catheter manipulation.
To address this, we propose an AI-driven tracking model that estimates the
device tip incident angle and passing point within the ICE imaging plane,
ensuring continuous visibility and facilitating robotic ICE catheter control.
  A key innovation of our approach is the hybrid dataset generation strategy,
which combines clinical ICE sequences with synthetic data augmentation to
enhance model robustness. We collected ICE images in a water chamber setup,
equipping both the ICE catheter and device tip with electromagnetic (EM)
sensors to establish precise ground-truth locations. Synthetic sequences were
created by overlaying catheter tips onto real ICE images, preserving motion
continuity while simulating diverse anatomical scenarios. The final dataset
consists of 5,698 ICE-tip image pairs, ensuring comprehensive training
coverage.
  Our model architecture integrates a pretrained ultrasound (US) foundation
model, trained on 37.4M echocardiography images, for feature extraction. A
transformer-based network processes sequential ICE frames, leveraging
historical passing points and incident angles to improve prediction accuracy.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 3.32 degree entry
angle error, 12.76 degree rotation angle error. This AI-driven framework lays
the foundation for real-time robotic ICE catheter adjustments, minimizing
operator workload while ensuring consistent therapy device visibility. Future
work will focus on expanding clinical datasets to further enhance model
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI图像去噪中，监督学习方法需要高信噪比标签，而自监督方法容易过度平滑细节。C2S旨在解决标签稀缺问题并提升去噪性能。

Method: 提出广义去噪分数匹配（GDSM）损失，直接利用噪声数据建模高信噪比图像的条件期望，并引入噪声水平重参数化和细节细化扩展。

Result: 在M4Raw和fastMRI数据集上，C2S在自监督方法中达到最优性能，并与监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: C2S为MRI去噪提供了一种高效的自监督解决方案，平衡了噪声去除与细节保留。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive diagnostic imaging
tool that provides unparalleled soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail.
Noise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions,
can significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised
learning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but
require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable.
Self-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but
existing self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial
features and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We
introduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework
for MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching
(GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy
observations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given
further corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn
denoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally,
we incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and
enhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance
noise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S
can be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary
information across different MRI contrasts. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and
competitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise
conditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI dataset.

Result: 在临床数据上实现5分钟内的高质量重建，20分钟内达到0.99 SSIM，专家评价为最真实的重建方法。

Conclusion: UltraGauss为超声3D重建提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used due to its safety, affordability, and
real-time capabilities, but its 2D interpretation is highly operator-dependent,
leading to variability and increased cognitive demand. 2D-to-3D reconstruction
mitigates these challenges by providing standardized volumetric views, yet
existing methods are often computationally expensive, memory-intensive, or
incompatible with ultrasound physics. We introduce UltraGauss: the first
ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis
techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional
perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D,
aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization
boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable
covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and
reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves
state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20
minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss'
reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA
implementation will be released upon publication.

extension of EfficientNet designed to process arbitrary vector-valued data. The
proposed models are evaluated on a medical image classification task, achieving
an average accuracy of 99.46% on the ALL-IDB2 dataset for detecting acute

Abstract: Histopathology evaluation of tissue specimens through microscopic examination
is essential for accurate disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, traditional
manual analysis by specially trained pathologists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, cost-inefficient, and prone to inter-rater variability,
potentially affecting diagnostic consistency and accuracy. As digital pathology
images continue to proliferate, there is a pressing need for automated analysis
to address these challenges. Recent advancements in artificial
intelligence-based tools such as machine learning (ML) models, have
significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of analyzing
histopathological slides. However, despite their impressive performance, ML
models are invariant only to translation, lacking invariance to rotation and
reflection. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize effectively,
particularly in histopathology, where images intrinsically lack meaningful
orientation. In this study, we develop robust, equivariant histopathological
biomarkers through a novel symmetric convolutional kernel via unsupervised
segmentation. The approach is validated using prostate tissue micro-array (TMA)
images from 50 patients in the Gleason 2019 Challenge public dataset. The
biomarkers extracted through this approach demonstrate enhanced robustness and
generalizability against rotation compared to models using standard convolution
kernels, holding promise for enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and
robustness of ML models in digital pathology. Ultimately, this work aims to
improve diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of histopathology beyond
prostate cancer through equivariant imaging.

*Haoyang Pei,Ding Xia,Xiang Xu,William Moore,Yao Wang,Hersh Chandarana,Li Feng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合学习框架，结合自监督和监督学习，用于MRI图像重建，解决了高加速率下自监督学习性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习需要高质量参考图像，而自监督学习在高加速率下性能下降，混合学习旨在克服这些限制。

Method: 分两阶段训练：第一阶段用自监督学习生成改进图像，第二阶段用监督学习进一步优化。

Result: 在螺旋UTE肺MRI和3D T1脑成像中，混合学习在图像质量和定量准确性上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 混合学习为低质量或不完整参考数据下的MRI重建提供了有效解决方案，有望推动深度学习MRI的临床应用。

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI
reconstruction, but conventional supervised learning methods require
high-quality reference images, which are often unavailable in practice.
Self-supervised learning offers an alternative, yet its performance degrades at
high acceleration rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid
learning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised
and supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.
  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the
first stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images
from noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as
pseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to
refine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We
evaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated
0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of
the brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.
  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image
quality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across
different acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping,
hybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide
dynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.
  Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for
training deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete
reference data are available. It enables improved image quality and accurate
quantitative mapping across different applications and field strengths,
representing a promising technique toward broader clinical deployment of deep
learning-based MRI.

Abstract: Automatic lymph node segmentation is the cornerstone for advances in computer
vision tasks for early detection and staging of cancer. Traditional
segmentation methods are constrained by manual delineation and variability in
operator proficiency, limiting their ability to achieve high accuracy. The
introduction of deep learning technologies offers new possibilities for
improving the accuracy of lymph node image analysis. This study evaluates the
application of deep learning in lymph node segmentation and discusses the
methodologies of various deep learning architectures such as convolutional
neural networks, encoder-decoder networks, and transformers in analyzing
medical imaging data across different modalities. Despite the advancements, it
still confronts challenges like the shape diversity of lymph nodes, the
scarcity of accurately labeled datasets, and the inadequate development of
methods that are robust and generalizable across different imaging modalities.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a
comprehensive overview of the application of deep learning techniques in lymph
node segmentation task. Furthermore, this study also explores potential future
research directions, including multimodal fusion techniques, transfer learning,
and the use of large-scale pre-trained models to overcome current limitations
while enhancing cancer diagnosis and treatment planning strategies.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架S2MNet，通过整合六个常规2D超声心动图切片，重建连续高保真3D心脏模型，解决了现有3D超声心动图分辨率低、成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管超声心动图在心脏评估中广泛应用，但其2D视图限制了三维解剖和功能的全面评估。现有3D超声心动图存在分辨率低、成本高的问题，亟需一种高效解决方案。

Method: S2MNet通过模拟六个2D超声心动图切片生成训练数据，并引入基于变形场的方法，避免3D重建中的空间不连续或结构伪影。

Result: 实验验证表明，重建的左心室体积与医生测量的GLPS呈强相关性，符合医学理论，证明了方法的可靠性。

Conclusion: S2MNet提供了一种高效、可靠的3D心脏模型重建方法，有望提升临床心脏评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Echocardiogram is the most commonly used imaging modality in cardiac
assessment duo to its non-invasive nature, real-time capability, and
cost-effectiveness. Despite its advantages, most clinical echocardiograms
provide only two-dimensional views, limiting the ability to fully assess
cardiac anatomy and function in three dimensions. While three-dimensional
echocardiography exists, it often suffers from reduced resolution, limited
availability, and higher acquisition costs. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a deep learning framework S2MNet that reconstructs continuous and
high-fidelity 3D heart models by integrating six slices of routinely acquired
2D echocardiogram views. Our method has three advantages. First, our method
avoid the difficulties on training data acquasition by simulate six of 2D
echocardiogram images from corresponding slices of a given 3D heart mesh.
Second, we introduce a deformation field-based method, which avoid spatial
discontinuities or structural artifacts in 3D echocardiogram reconstructions.
We validate our method using clinically collected echocardiogram and
demonstrate that our estimated left ventricular volume, a key clinical
indicator of cardiac function, is strongly correlated with the doctor measured
GLPS, a clinical measurement that should demonstrate a negative correlation
with LVE in medical theory. This association confirms the reliability of our
proposed 3D construction method.

*Diego Adame,Jose A. Nunez,Fabian Vazquez,Nayeli Gurrola,Huimin Li,Haoteng Tang,Bin Fu,Pengfei Gu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Topo-VM-UNetV2的新方法，通过将拓扑特征编码到基于Mamba的VM-UNetV2模型中，改进了息肉分割的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在息肉分割中存在局限性：CNN难以建模长距离依赖，而Transformer计算复杂度高。Mamba模型虽能有效建模长距离交互且计算复杂度低，但仍无法捕捉拓扑特征，导致边界分割不准确。

Method: 方法分为两阶段：1）使用VM-UNetV2生成概率图并计算拓扑注意力图；2）将拓扑注意力图集成到VM-UNetV2的SDI模块中，形成Topo-SDI模块以增强分割结果。

Result: 在五个公开息肉分割数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Topo-VM-UNetV2通过结合拓扑特征显著提升了息肉分割的准确性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer-based architectures are
two dominant deep learning models for polyp segmentation. However, CNNs have
limited capability for modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformers
incur quadratic computational complexity. Recently, State Space Models such as
Mamba have been recognized as a promising approach for polyp segmentation
because they not only model long-range interactions effectively but also
maintain linear computational complexity. However, Mamba-based architectures
still struggle to capture topological features (e.g., connected components,
loops, voids), leading to inaccurate boundary delineation and polyp
segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach called
Topo-VM-UNetV2, which encodes topological features into the Mamba-based
state-of-the-art polyp segmentation model, VM-UNetV2. Our method consists of
two stages: Stage 1: VM-UNetV2 is used to generate probability maps (PMs) for
the training and test images, which are then used to compute topology attention
maps. Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams of the PMs, then we
generate persistence score maps by assigning persistence values (i.e., the
difference between death and birth times) of each topological feature to its
birth location, finally we transform persistence scores into attention weights
using the sigmoid function. Stage 2: These topology attention maps are
integrated into the semantics and detail infusion (SDI) module of VM-UNetV2 to
form a topology-guided semantics and detail infusion (Topo-SDI) module for
enhancing the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on five public polyp
segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The
code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 论文提出OccuEMBED框架，通过智能电表数据推断建筑占用情况和系统运行状态，结合深度学习模型实现以居住者为中心的节能和电网灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑能耗和排放占全球重要比例，需高效运行以支持电网稳定性，但大规模集中管理中居住者信息整合困难。

Method: 提出OccuEMBED框架，包含概率占用生成器和基于KAN的可解释负载分解器，结合深度学习模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集中表现优异，占用推断F1分数高于0.8，连续占用比RMSE为0.1-0.2。

Conclusion: OccuEMBED为规模化居住者中心建筑管理系统提供了坚实基础，适应能源系统演变挑战。

Abstract: Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and
emissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids
become more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide
flexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in
enhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must
prioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets.
However, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized
building operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate
the potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy
and system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building
energy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at
scale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy
inference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a
probabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable
load disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design
embeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships
into deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to
demonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared
to various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1
scores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for
continuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates
with building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze
system-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model
lays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management
systems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.

Result: 模型在Bristol的NRMSE降低8.6%，梯度RMSE降低32.6%。

Conclusion: 虚拟传感器有望为空气质量监测提供低成本解决方案，助力气候与健康干预。

Abstract: Air pollution is a significant global health risk, contributing to millions
of premature deaths annually. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a harmful pollutant,
disproportionately affects urban areas where monitoring networks are often
sparse. We propose a novel method for predicting NO2 concentrations at
unmonitored locations using transfer learning with satellite and meteorological
data. Leveraging the GraphSAGE framework, our approach integrates
autoregression and transfer learning to enhance predictive accuracy in
data-scarce regions like Bristol. Pre-trained on data from London, UK, our
model achieves a 8.6% reduction in Normalised Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE)
and a 32.6% reduction in Gradient RMSE compared to a baseline model. This work
demonstrates the potential of virtual sensors for cost-effective air quality
monitoring, contributing to actionable insights for climate and health
interventions.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的ECG去噪框架ECGDeDRDNet，采用双循环密集网络架构，结合ECG波形和估计的干净图像信息，显著提升去噪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG信号常受基线漂移、肌肉伪影和电极运动等噪声干扰，影响诊断准确性，需要更有效的去噪方法。

Method: 使用LSTM层与DenseNet块结合的双循环架构，迭代利用ECG波形和估计的干净图像信息。

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，PSNR和SSIM优于传统图像去噪方法，SNR和RMSE优于经典ECG去噪技术。

Conclusion: ECGDeDRDNet通过双循环架构充分利用时空信息，显著提升了ECG去噪性能。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are frequently corrupted by noise, such as
baseline wander (BW), muscle artifacts (MA), and electrode motion (EM), which
significantly degrade their diagnostic utility. To address this issue, we
propose ECGDeDRDNet, a deep learning-based ECG Denoising framework leveraging a
Double Recurrent Dense Network architecture. In contrast to traditional
approaches, we introduce a double recurrent scheme to enhance information reuse
from both ECG waveforms and the estimated clean image. For ECG waveform
processing, our basic model employs LSTM layers cascaded with DenseNet blocks.
The estimated clean ECG image, obtained by subtracting predicted noise
components from the noisy input, is iteratively fed back into the model. This
dual recurrent architecture enables comprehensive utilization of both temporal
waveform features and spatial image details, leading to more effective noise
suppression. Experimental results on the MIT-BIH dataset demonstrate that our
method achieves superior performance compared to conventional image denoising
methods in terms of PSNR and SSIM while also surpassing classical ECG denoising
techniques in both SNR and RMSE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基于傅里叶域基展开的模型，解决了传统体素模型的计算成本高、收敛慢和易产生伪影等问题，并在非笛卡尔MRI重建中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素模型存在高计算成本、慢收敛和伪影等问题，且可能被忽视了一些新问题（如近似误差、周期性和零空间特性）。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于傅里叶域基展开的模型，替代传统的图像域体素模型。

Conclusion: 新模型有效解决了传统体素模型的局限性，为傅里叶成像数据重建提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: For the past several decades, it has been popular to reconstruct Fourier
imaging data using model-based approaches that can easily incorporate physical
constraints and advanced regularization/machine learning priors. The most
common modeling approach is to represent the continuous image as a linear
combination of shifted "voxel" basis functions. Although well-studied and
widely-deployed, this voxel-based model is associated with longstanding
limitations, including high computational costs, slow convergence, and a
propensity for artifacts. In this work, we reexamine this model from a fresh
perspective, identifying new issues that may have been previously overlooked
(including undesirable approximation, periodicity, and nullspace
characteristics). Our insights motivate us to propose a new model that is more
resilient to the limitations (old and new) of the previous approach.
Specifically, the new model is based on a Fourier-domain basis expansion rather
than the standard image-domain voxel-based approach. Illustrative results,
which are presented in the context of non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction,
demonstrate that the new model enables improved image quality (reduced
artifacts) and/or reduced computational complexity (faster computations and
improved convergence).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新型上下文学习（ICL）框架，用于编码多输入多输出（MIMO）系统中的软输入软输出信道均衡。通过提示增强技术，结合解码器反馈的外在信息，ICL模型能够迭代优化符号估计。实验表明，在传统线性假设失效时（如低分辨率量化），ICL均衡器优于传统模型基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信道均衡方法在非线性场景（如低分辨率量化）中表现不佳，需要一种更灵活的方法来适应复杂信道条件。

Method: 提出了基于Transformer和状态空间架构的两种ICL模型，利用提示增强技术迭代优化符号估计。

Result: ICL均衡器在非线性场景中表现优于传统方法，且Transformer模型在训练多样性有限时表现更优，状态空间模型在资源受限场景中更高效。

Conclusion: ICL框架为复杂信道条件下的均衡问题提供了有效解决方案，尤其在非线性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel in-context learning (ICL) framework, inspired
by large language models (LLMs), for soft-input soft-output channel
equalization in coded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The
proposed approach learns to infer posterior symbol distributions directly from
a prompt of pilot signals and decoder feedback. A key innovation is the use of
prompt augmentation to incorporate extrinsic information from the decoder
output as additional context, enabling the ICL model to refine its symbol
estimates iteratively across turbo decoding iterations. Two model variants,
based on Transformer and state-space architectures, are developed and
evaluated. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, when traditional linear
assumptions break down, e.g., in the presence of low-resolution quantization,
ICL equalizers consistently outperform conventional model-based baselines, even
when the latter are provided with perfect channel state information. Results
also highlight the advantage of Transformer-based models under limited training
diversity, as well as the efficiency of state-space models in
resource-constrained scenarios.

Result: DRL辅助方法在吞吐量上显著优于传统波束扫描和AoD方法，且对不同用户速度具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRL辅助的感知通信优化方法能有效提升毫米波通信性能，无需用户反馈或先验状态信息。

Abstract: Mobile users are prone to experience beam failure due to beam drifting in
millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. Sensing can help alleviate beam
drifting with timely beam changes and low overhead since it does not need user
feedback. This work studies the problem of optimizing sensing-aided
communication by dynamically managing beams allocated to mobile users. A
multi-beam scheme is introduced, which allocates multiple beams to the users
that need an update on the angle of departure (AoD) estimates and a single beam
to the users that have satisfied AoD estimation precision. A deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) assisted method is developed to optimize the beam allocation
policy, relying only upon the sensing echoes. For comparison, a heuristic
AoD-based method using approximated Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for
allocation is also presented. Both methods require neither user feedback nor
prior state evolution information. Results show that the DRL-assisted method
achieves a considerable gain in throughput than the conventional beam sweeping
method and the AoD-based method, and it is robust to different user speeds.

Conclusion: MLLM可以有效地规划和执行修图操作，保留对象细节，并提供可解释的编辑建议。

Abstract: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.
Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible
to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in
unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional
procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,
Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.
Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual
procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In
this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to
critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them
with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate
that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing
operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.
Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit
sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we
synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits
and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize
reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by
construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and
resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a
variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and
identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural
alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via
our project website at https://monetgpt.github.io.

Abstract: Rigging and skinning are essential steps to create realistic 3D animations,
often requiring significant expertise and manual effort. Traditional attempts
at automating these processes rely heavily on geometric heuristics and often
struggle with objects of complex geometry. Recent data-driven approaches show
potential for better generality, but are often constrained by limited training
data. We present the Anymate Dataset, a large-scale dataset of 230K 3D assets
paired with expert-crafted rigging and skinning information -- 70 times larger
than existing datasets. Using this dataset, we propose a learning-based
auto-rigging framework with three sequential modules for joint, connectivity,
and skinning weight prediction. We systematically design and experiment with
various architectures as baselines for each module and conduct comprehensive
evaluations on our dataset to compare their performance. Our models
significantly outperform existing methods, providing a foundation for comparing
future methods in automated rigging and skinning. Code and dataset can be found

Motivation: 盲语音分离（BSS）是一个具有挑战性的盲逆问题，因为麦克风阵列几何、房间脉冲响应和语音源均未知。

Method: 提出ArrayDPS，基于扩散后验采样（DPS），通过优化问题近似房间声学和相对传递函数，结合扩散先验迭代采样分离语音源。

Result: ArrayDPS在SDR指标上优于所有无监督基线方法，与监督方法相当。

Conclusion: ArrayDPS是一种高效的无监督盲语音分离方法，无需麦克风阵列信息，仅需单说话人语音扩散模型作为先验。

Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from
audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging
because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the
room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We
propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic,
and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling
(DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must
approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The
solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative
transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the
diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately
yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech
diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones;
no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that
ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable
to supervised methods in terms of SDR. Audio demos are provided at:

Abstract: While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized
image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new
opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs)
leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform
classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy

limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an
encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We
demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to
directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for
classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an
automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity
characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum
circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and
convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs
and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum
processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the
$71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training
conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image
classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum
computing in this area.

### [195] [Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05940)
*Rodrigo Diaz,Mark Sandler*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于JAX库的快速、可微分、GPU加速的模态框架，用于模拟弦、膜和板的振动，显著提升了计算效率并支持基于梯度的逆建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在模拟非线性模型（如von Kármán板）时计算量大且不可微分，限制了逆建模和实时应用。

Method: 使用JAX库构建的GPU加速模态框架，支持高效模拟和梯度计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在计算效率上显著优于传统CPU和GPU实现，并能从合成和实验数据中恢复物理参数。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然对初始值更敏感，但提供了更高的可解释性和更紧凑的参数化，代码已开源。

Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are
widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However,
traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von
K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability,
limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast,
differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library,
providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling.
Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based
implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse
modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical
parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and
experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to
initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability
and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to
support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling
and sound synthesis.

Method: 评估多种音乐音频表示模型在有限数据（5至8,000分钟）下的表现，分析其在不同音乐信息检索任务中的鲁棒性。

Result: 某些条件下，有限数据或随机模型的表现与大数据集模型相当，但手工特征在部分任务中仍更优。

Conclusion: 有限数据条件下，某些模型表现良好，但手工特征仍有优势，需进一步研究优化小数据场景下的模型表现。

Abstract: Large deep-learning models for music, including those focused on learning
general-purpose music audio representations, are often assumed to require
substantial training data to achieve high performance. If true, this would pose
challenges in scenarios where audio data or annotations are scarce, such as for
underrepresented music traditions, non-popular genres, and personalized music
creation and listening. Understanding how these models behave in limited-data
scenarios could be crucial for developing techniques to tackle them.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of several music audio
representation models under limited-data learning regimes. We consider music
models with various architectures, training paradigms, and input durations, and
train them on data collections ranging from 5 to 8,000 minutes long. We
evaluate the learned representations on various music information retrieval
tasks and analyze their robustness to noise. We show that, under certain
conditions, representations from limited-data and even random models perform
comparably to ones from large-dataset models, though handcrafted features
outperform all learned representations in some tasks.

Result: 与FedAvg和FedSGD等基线算法相比，FedAvgen表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: FedAvgen通过遗传进化思想优化联邦学习中的全局模型聚合，有效应对设备多样性挑战。

Abstract: To improve business efficiency and minimize costs, Artificial Intelligence
(AI) practitioners have adopted a shift from formulating models from scratch
towards sharing pretrained models. The pretrained models are then aggregated
into a global model with higher generalization capabilities, which is
afterwards distributed to the client devices. This approach is known as
federated learning and inherently utilizes different techniques to select the
candidate client models averaged to obtain the global model. This approach, in
the case of communication systems, faces challenges arising from the
existential diversity in device profiles. The multiplicity in profiles
motivates our conceptual assessment of a metaheuristic algorithm (FedAvgen),
which relates each pretrained model with its weight space as metadata, to a
phenotype and genotype, respectively. This parent-child genetic evolution
characterizes the global averaging step in federated learning. We then compare
the results of our approach to two widely adopted baseline federated learning
algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Federated Stochastic Gradient
Descent (FedSGD).

Result: 实证结果表明，LLMs能生成更优候选解，提升进化算法的效果。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和EAs的方法在复杂任务中表现优越，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have unveiled remarkable capabilities in
understanding and generating both natural language and code, but LLM reasoning
is prone to hallucination and struggle with complex, novel scenarios, often
getting stuck on partial or incorrect solutions. However, the inherent ability
of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to explore extensive and complex search spaces
makes them particularly effective in scenarios where traditional optimization
methodologies may falter. However, EAs explore a vast search space when applied
to complex problems.
  To address the computational bottleneck of evaluating large populations,
particularly crucial for complex evolutionary tasks, we introduce a highly
efficient evaluation framework. This implementation maintains compatibility
with existing primitive definitions, ensuring the generation of valid
individuals.
  Using LLMs, we propose an enhanced evolutionary search strategy that enables
a more focused exploration of expansive solution spaces. LLMs facilitate the
generation of superior candidate solutions, as evidenced by empirical results
demonstrating their efficacy in producing improved outcomes.

Abstract: The circadian rhythm plays a crucial role in regulating biological processes,
and its disruption is linked to various health issues. Identifying small
molecules that influence the circadian period is essential for developing
targeted therapies. This study explores the use of evolutionary optimization
techniques to enhance the classification of these molecules. We applied an
evolutionary algorithm to optimize feature selection and classification
performance. Several machine learning classifiers were employed, and
performance was evaluated using accuracy and generalization ability. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed evolutionary optimization method
improves classification accuracy and reduces overfitting compared to baseline
models. Additionally, the use of variance in accuracy as a penalty factor may
enhance the model's reliability for real-world applications. Our study confirms
that evolutionary optimization is an effective strategy for classifying small
molecules regulating the circadian rhythm. The proposed approach not only

Conclusion: Akkumula框架高效、适应性强，并能与现有机器学习架构集成，提升了模型的透明度和动态场景处理能力。

Abstract: Processes of evidence accumulation for motor control contribute to the
ecological validity of driver models. According to established theories of
cognition, drivers make control adjustments when a process of accumulation of
perceptual inputs reaches a decision boundary. Unfortunately, there is not a
standard way for building such models, limiting their use. Current
implementations are hand-crafted, lack adaptability, and rely on inefficient
optimization techniques that do not scale well with large datasets. This paper
introduces Akkumula, an evidence accumulation modelling framework built using
deep learning techniques to leverage established coding libraries, gradient
optimization, and large batch training. The core of the library is based on
Spiking Neural Networks, whose operation mimic the evidence accumulation
process in the biological brain. The model was tested on data collected during
a test-track experiment. Results are promising. The model fits well the time
course of vehicle control (brake, accelerate, steering) based on vehicle sensor
data. The perceptual inputs are extracted by a dedicated neural network,
increasing the context-awareness of the model in dynamic scenarios. Akkumula
integrates with existing machine learning architectures, benefits from
continuous advancements in deep learning, efficiently processes large datasets,
adapts to diverse driving scenarios, and maintains a degree of transparency in
its core mechanisms.

Method: 采用块式增量训练、INR初始化和替换批量归一化策略。

Result: 生成的变形网络在广泛压缩比下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度模型的高效部署提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural
networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct
generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen
during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves
effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its
broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that
extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with
minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe
comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies
for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain
competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a
scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The
code is available at: https://github.com/TSommariva/HTTY_NeuMeta.

Conclusion: 优化储能配置可降低成本、提升经济效益，助力电力系统可持续发展。

Abstract: This study aims to analyze the economic performance of various parks under
different conditions, particularly focusing on the operational costs and power
load balancing before and after the deployment of energy storage systems.
Firstly, the economic performance of the parks without energy storage was
analyzed using a random forest model. Taking Park A as an example, it was found
that the cost had the greatest correlation with electricity purchase, followed
by photovoltaic output, indicating that solar and wind power output are key
factors affecting economic performance. Subsequently, the operation of the
parks after the configuration of a 50kW/100kWh energy storage system was
simulated, and the total cost and operation strategy of the energy storage
system were calculated. The results showed that after the deployment of energy
storage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased,
and the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used
to optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage
operation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover
operations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic
indicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved. The research results indicate
that by optimizing energy storage configuration, each park can reduce costs,
enhance economic benefits, and achieve sustainable development of the power
system.

Result: 光子计算系统在吞吐量和能效上可能远超电子处理器，但在内存和超大数据集存储方面仍需突破。

Conclusion: 光子计算有望为大规模LLM提供高效解决方案，但需解决内存和存储等关键问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly pushing the limits of contemporary
computing hardware. For example, training GPT-3 has been estimated to consume
around 1300 MWh of electricity, and projections suggest future models may
require city-scale (gigawatt) power budgets. These demands motivate exploration
of computing paradigms beyond conventional von Neumann architectures. This
review surveys emerging photonic hardware optimized for next-generation
generative AI computing. We discuss integrated photonic neural network
architectures (e.g., Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, lasers,
wavelength-multiplexed microring resonators) that perform ultrafast matrix
operations. We also examine promising alternative neuromorphic devices,
including spiking neural network circuits and hybrid spintronic-photonic
synapses, which combine memory and processing. The integration of
two-dimensional materials (graphene, TMDCs) into silicon photonic platforms is
reviewed for tunable modulators and on-chip synaptic elements.
Transformer-based LLM architectures (self-attention and feed-forward layers)
are analyzed in this context, identifying strategies and challenges for mapping
dynamic matrix multiplications onto these novel hardware substrates. We then
dissect the mechanisms of mainstream LLMs, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and
LLaMA, highlighting their architectural similarities and differences. We
synthesize state-of-the-art components, algorithms, and integration methods,
highlighting key advances and open issues in scaling such systems to mega-sized
LLM models. We find that photonic computing systems could potentially surpass
electronic processors by orders of magnitude in throughput and energy
efficiency, but require breakthroughs in memory, especially for long-context
windows and long token sequences, and in storage of ultra-large datasets.

Method: 提出Token-wise Adaptive Activation Quantization（AAQ）软件技术，结合多精度可重构矩阵处理单元（RMPU）和多功能向量处理单元（VVPU）的硬件设计。

Result: LightNobel相比NVIDIA A100和H100 GPU分别实现了8.44x、8.41x的速度提升和37.29x、43.35x的能效提升，同时显著降低内存需求。

Conclusion: LightNobel通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了PPM的可扩展性问题，为长序列蛋白质的高效处理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Protein Structure Prediction Models (PPMs), such as
AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, have revolutionized computational biology by achieving
unprecedented accuracy in predicting three-dimensional protein folding
structures. However, these models face significant scalability challenges,
particularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g.,
sequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the
exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure
in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial
memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective
scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or
complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.
  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed
accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence
length in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation
Quantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as
distogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization
techniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel
integrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and
versatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of
AAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup
and 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100
GPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss. It also reduces
the peak memory requirement up to 120.05x in PPM, enabling scalable processing
for proteins with long sequences.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training is one of the most demanding distributed
computations today, often requiring thousands of GPUs with frequent
synchronization across machines. Such a workload pattern makes it susceptible
to stragglers, where the training can be stalled by few slow workers. At
ByteDance we find stragglers are not trivially always caused by hardware
failures, but can arise from multiple complex factors. This work aims to
present a comprehensive study on the straggler issues in LLM training, using a
five-month trace collected from our ByteDance LLM training cluster. The core
methodology is what-if analysis that simulates the scenario without any
stragglers and contrasts with the actual case. We use this method to study the
following questions: (1) how often do stragglers affect training jobs, and what
effect do they have on job performance; (2) do stragglers exhibit temporal or
spatial patterns; and (3) what are the potential root causes for stragglers?

Abstract: This study focuses on the problem of path modeling in heterogeneous
information networks and proposes a multi-hop path-aware recommendation
framework. The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of
entities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path
selection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path
selection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant
and noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential
modeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving
the semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention
mechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user
interest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as
Amazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
recommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10,
Recall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop
paths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the
expressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous
recommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical
value by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks
with recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible
paradigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.

Conclusion: MINT为单模态模型与多模态知识对齐提供了有效策略。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to
effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized
biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal
Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder
models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data
through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization
techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference
Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the
aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs
while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an
upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality
multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or
image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications:
(1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal
encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a
preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite
relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained
with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue
type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a
vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing
knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align
downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly
improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type
classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align
unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference
optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出CLAM方法，通过无监督学习从无标签观测数据中学习连续潜在动作标签，显著提升了复杂机器人任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量标注动作的专家演示，数据获取成本高，限制了训练规模。利用无标签观测数据（如视频演示）学习潜在动作标签是解决这一瓶颈的潜在方法。

Method: 设计了连续潜在动作模型（CLAM），采用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，并联合训练动作解码器，确保潜在动作空间能轻松映射到真实动作。

Result: 在DMControl（运动）和MetaWorld（操作）基准测试及真实WidowX机器人上，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM无需专家标注数据，仅需少量非最优标注数据即可学习高性能策略，为复杂连续控制任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot

Main category: cs.RO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策任务中表现出色，但其幻觉行为可能产生不安全输出，需有效检测以避免风险。

Method: 采用AST和MCTS搜索提示扰动空间，生成高不确定性场景和提示，离线分析用于实时信任评估。

Result: 通过MCTS生成扰动树，证明离线分析可动态影响模型不确定性并支持实时信任判断。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测LLMs幻觉，提升其在安全关键任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in
generalizing across decision-making tasks including planning, control and
prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs
poses risks. We argue that detecting such failures is necessary, especially in
safety-critical scenarios. Existing black-box methods often detect
hallucinations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple samples. Many of
these approaches typically introduce prompt perturbations like randomizing
detail order or generating adversarial inputs, with the intuition that a
confident model should produce stable outputs. We first perform a manual case
study showing that other forms of perturbations (e.g., adding noise, removing
sensor details) cause LLMs to hallucinate in a driving environment. We then
propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt
perturbations using Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios and prompts that
cause language models to act with high uncertainty. By generating MCTS prompt
perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show that offline analyses can
be used at runtime to automatically generate prompts that influence model
uncertainty, and to inform real-time trust assessments of an LLM.

Conclusion: 研究为空间机器人控制提供了新的高效方法，并首次在国际空间站上验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Although widely used in commercial and industrial robotics, trajectory
optimization has seen limited use in space applications due to its high
computational demands. In this work, we present flight results from experiments
with the Astrobee free-flying robot on board the International Space Station
(ISS), that demonstrate how machine learning can accelerate on-board trajectory
optimization while preserving theoretical solver guarantees. To the best of the
authors' knowledge, this is the first-ever demonstration of learning-based
control on the ISS. Our approach leverages the GuSTO sequential convex
programming framework and uses a neural network, trained offline, to map
problem parameters to effective initial ``warm-start'' trajectories, paving the
way for faster real-time optimization on resource-constrained space platforms.

Abstract: Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret
natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges
as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D
spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN
agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle
in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the
exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work,
we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent
that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN.
Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that
decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels.
The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with
different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing
historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify
navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement.
Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of
CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments. The code is

Result: 开放环精度与闭环驾驶行为无直接关联，参数减少的模型在某些情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 运动预测模型的设计需综合考虑开放环精度、时间一致性和规划器兼容性，参数优化可提升实际驾驶性能。

Abstract: Fueled by motion prediction competitions and benchmarks, recent years have
seen the emergence of increasingly large learning based prediction models, many
with millions of parameters, focused on improving open-loop prediction accuracy
by mere centimeters. However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such
improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous
driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between
state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that
higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop
driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of
predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore,
we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that
in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even
superior closed-loop driving performance. Our code is available at

Method: 通过程序生成约1,000种不同的机器人形态（如人形、四足、六足等），训练通用策略以处理多样化的观察和动作空间。

Abstract: Developing generalist agents that can operate across diverse tasks,
environments, and physical embodiments is a grand challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. In this work, we focus on the axis of embodiment and
investigate embodiment scaling laws$\unicode{x2013}$the hypothesis that
increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen
ones. Using robot locomotion as a test bed, we procedurally generate a dataset
of $\sim$1,000 varied embodiments, spanning humanoids, quadrupeds, and
hexapods, and train generalist policies capable of handling diverse observation
and action spaces on random subsets. We find that increasing the number of
training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, and scaling
embodiments is more effective in enabling embodiment-level generalization than
scaling data on small, fixed sets of embodiments. Notably, our best policy,
trained on the full dataset, zero-shot transfers to novel embodiments in the
real world, such as Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward
general embodied intelligence, with potential relevance to adaptive control for
configurable robots, co-design of morphology and control, and beyond.

generalizability comparatively, we conducted experiments with models from both

provided, exhibiting substantial potential for enhancing the efficiency and

Conclusion: MBRA和LogoNav显著提升了导航策略的泛化性和稳健性。

Abstract: Developing broadly generalizable visual navigation policies for robots is a
significant challenge, primarily constrained by the availability of
large-scale, diverse training data. While curated datasets collected by
researchers offer high quality, their limited size restricts policy
generalization. To overcome this, we explore leveraging abundant, passively
collected data sources, including large volumes of crowd-sourced teleoperation
data and unlabeled YouTube videos, despite their potential for lower quality or
missing action labels. We propose Model-Based ReAnnotation (MBRA), a framework
that utilizes a learned short-horizon, model-based expert model to relabel or
generate high-quality actions for these passive datasets. This relabeled data
is then distilled into LogoNav, a long-horizon navigation policy conditioned on
visual goals or GPS waypoints. We demonstrate that LogoNav, trained using
MBRA-processed data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust
navigation over distances exceeding 300 meters in previously unseen indoor and
outdoor environments. Our extensive real-world evaluations, conducted across a
fleet of robots (including quadrupeds) in six cities on three continents,
validate the policy's ability to generalize and navigate effectively even
amidst pedestrians in crowded settings.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量动作标注数据，难以适应不同具身和环境，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 利用潜在动作模型从视频中提取任务中心化动作表示，结合语言指令和DINO特征空间，减少任务无关动态影响。

Result: 在多个操作和导航基准测试及实际机器人部署中取得最佳性能，计算和数据需求显著低于OpenVLA。

Conclusion: UniVLA展示了可扩展且高效的机器人策略学习潜力，支持异构数据（包括人类视频）的持续性能提升。

Abstract: A generalist robot should perform effectively across various environments.
However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data
to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single
physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across
different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we
propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment
vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive
task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model.
This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments
and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we
incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within
the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist
policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action
decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and
navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves
superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute
and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed
as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the
training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate
scalable and efficient robot policy learning.

Abstract: This dissertation considers Open-world Robot Manipulation, a manipulation
problem where a robot must generalize or quickly adapt to new objects, scenes,
or tasks for which it has not been pre-programmed or pre-trained. This
dissertation tackles the problem using a methodology of efficient sensorimotor
learning. The key to enabling efficient sensorimotor learning lies in
leveraging regular patterns that exist in limited amounts of demonstration
data. These patterns, referred to as ``regularity,'' enable the data-efficient
learning of generalizable manipulation skills. This dissertation offers a new
perspective on formulating manipulation problems through the lens of
regularity. Building upon this notion, we introduce three major contributions.
First, we introduce methods that endow robots with object-centric priors,
allowing them to learn generalizable, closed-loop sensorimotor policies from a
small number of teleoperation demonstrations. Second, we introduce methods that
constitute robots' spatial understanding, unlocking their ability to imitate
manipulation skills from in-the-wild video observations. Last but not least, we
introduce methods that enable robots to identify reusable skills from their
past experiences, resulting in systems that can continually imitate multiple
tasks in a sequential manner. Altogether, the contributions of this
dissertation help lay the groundwork for building general-purpose personal
robots that can quickly adapt to new situations or tasks with low-cost data
collection and interact easily with humans. By enabling robots to learn and
generalize from limited data, this dissertation takes a step toward realizing
the vision of intelligent robotic assistants that can be seamlessly integrated
into everyday scenarios.

Motivation: 机器人3D操作需要将语义和视觉感知转化为低层控制，现有视觉-语言模型在场景上下文感知方面有待改进。

Method: 提出3D-CAVLA模型，整合深度感知、任务导向的兴趣区域检测和链式思维推理，并在LIBERO仿真环境中进行实验。

Conclusion: 3D场景感知能力显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和适应性，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in 3D requires learning an $N$ degree-of-freedom joint
space trajectory of a robot manipulator. Robots must possess semantic and
visual perception abilities to transform real-world mappings of their workspace
into the low-level control necessary for object manipulation. Recent work has
demonstrated the capabilities of fine-tuning large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to learn the mapping between RGB images, language instructions, and
joint space control. These models typically take as input RGB images of the
workspace and language instructions, and are trained on large datasets of
teleoperated robot demonstrations. In this work, we explore methods to improve
the scene context awareness of a popular recent Vision-Language-Action model by
integrating chain-of-thought reasoning, depth perception, and task-oriented
region of interest detection. Our experiments in the LIBERO simulation
environment show that our proposed model, 3D-CAVLA, improves the success rate
across various LIBERO task suites, achieving an average success rate of
98.1$\%$. We also evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our method,
demonstrating that 3D scene awareness leads to robust learning and adaptation
for completely unseen tasks. 3D-CAVLA achieves an absolute improvement of
8.8$\%$ on unseen tasks. We will open-source our code and the unseen tasks

Abstract: Hiking on complex trails demands balance, agility, and adaptive
decision-making over unpredictable terrain. Current humanoid research remains
fragmented and inadequate for hiking: locomotion focuses on motor skills
without long-term goals or situational awareness, while semantic navigation
overlooks real-world embodiment and local terrain variability. We propose
training humanoids to hike on complex trails, driving integrative skill
development across visual perception, decision making, and motor execution. We
develop a learning framework, LEGO-H, that enables a vision-equipped humanoid
robot to hike complex trails autonomously. We introduce two technical
innovations: 1) A temporal vision transformer variant - tailored into
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework - anticipates future local goals
to guide movement, seamlessly integrating locomotion with goal-directed
navigation. 2) Latent representations of joint movement patterns, combined with
hierarchical metric learning - enhance Privileged Learning scheme - enable
smooth policy transfer from privileged training to onboard execution. These
components allow LEGO-H to handle diverse physical and environmental challenges
without relying on predefined motion patterns. Experiments across varied
simulated trails and robot morphologies highlight LEGO-H's versatility and
robustness, positioning hiking as a compelling testbed for embodied autonomy
and LEGO-H as a baseline for future humanoid development.

Abstract: Preference feedback collected by human or VLM annotators is often noisy,
presenting a significant challenge for preference-based reinforcement learning
that relies on accurate preference labels. To address this challenge, we
propose TREND, a novel framework that integrates few-shot expert demonstrations
with a tri-teaching strategy for effective noise mitigation. Our method trains
three reward models simultaneously, where each model views its small-loss
preference pairs as useful knowledge and teaches such useful pairs to its peer
network for updating the parameters. Remarkably, our approach requires as few
as one to three expert demonstrations to achieve high performance. We evaluate
TREND on various robotic manipulation tasks, achieving up to 90% success rates
even with noise levels as high as 40%, highlighting its effective robustness in
handling noisy preference feedback. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在复杂环境中表现不佳，无法维持Eikonal方程的关键性质（如最优值函数和测地距离）。

Method: 通过结合时间差分学习和度量学习，强制在有限区域内满足Bellman最优性原则，避免局部极小值并保留测地性质。

Result: 在2到12自由度的机器人配置中，该方法显著优于现有自监督学习方法，尤其在复杂和未见环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为复杂环境中的运动规划提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: The motion planning problem involves finding a collision-free path from a
robot's starting to its target configuration. Recently, self-supervised
learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without
requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for
training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these
methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key
properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and
geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the
Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex
and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of
optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid
spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the
Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in
handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with
robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).

Abstract: With robots increasingly integrating into human environments, understanding
and predicting human motion is essential for safe and efficient interactions.
Modern human motion and activity prediction approaches require high quality and
quantity of data for training and evaluation, usually collected from motion
capture systems, onboard or stationary sensors. Setting up these systems is
challenging due to the intricate setup of hardware components, extensive
calibration procedures, occlusions, and substantial costs. These constraints
make deploying such systems in new and large environments difficult and limit
their usability for in-the-wild measurements. In this paper we investigate the
possibility to apply the novel Ultra-Wideband (UWB) localization technology as
a scalable alternative for human motion capture in crowded and occlusion-prone
environments. We include additional sensing modalities such as eye-tracking,
onboard robot LiDAR and radar sensors, and record motion capture data as ground
truth for evaluation and comparison. The environment imitates a museum setup,
with up to four active participants navigating toward random goals in a natural
way, and offers more than 130 minutes of multi-modal data. Our investigation
provides a step toward scalable and accurate motion data collection beyond
vision-based systems, laying a foundation for evaluating sensing modalities
like UWB in larger and complex environments like warehouses, airports, or
convention centers.

Conclusion: TAP是一个通用且可推广的框架，有望推动机器人主动触觉感知的发展。

Abstract: Humans make extensive use of haptic exploration to map and identify the
properties of the objects that we touch. In robotics, active tactile perception
has emerged as an important research domain that complements vision for tasks
such as object classification, shape reconstruction, and manipulation. This
work introduces TAP (Task-agnostic Active Perception) -- a novel framework that
leverages reinforcement learning (RL) and transformer-based architectures to
address the challenges posed by partially observable environments. TAP
integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and CrossQ algorithms within a unified
optimization objective, jointly training a perception module and
decision-making policy. By design, TAP is completely task-agnostic and can, in
principle, generalize to any active perception problem. We evaluate TAP across
diverse tasks, including toy examples and realistic applications involving
haptic exploration of 3D models from the Tactile MNIST benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of TAP, achieving high accuracies on the Tactile MNIST
haptic digit recognition task and a tactile pose estimation task. These
findings underscore the potential of TAP as a versatile and generalizable
framework for advancing active tactile perception in robotics.

Conclusion: 聊天机器人系统在提高青少年心理健康意识方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a chatbot-based system to engage young Spanish people in
the awareness of certain mental disorders through a self-disclosure technique.
The study was carried out in a population of teenagers aged between 12 and 18
years. The dialogue engine mixes closed and open conversations, so certain
controlled messages are sent to focus the chat on a specific disorder, which
will change over time. Once a set of trial questions is answered, the system
can initiate the conversation on the disorder under the focus according to the
user's sensibility to that disorder, in an attempt to establish a more
empathetic communication. Then, an open conversation based on the GPT-3
language model is initiated, allowing the user to express themselves with more
freedom. The results show that these systems are of interest to young people
and could help them become aware of certain mental disorders.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统综述探讨了恐怖谷效应（UVE）对人类对智能代理信任的影响，分析了53项实证研究，揭示了研究方法与测量工具的局限性，并提出了新的分类框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能代理在日常生活中的普及，理解人类对其信任的形成机制至关重要。恐怖谷效应（UVE）作为影响信任的关键因素，现有研究对其定义和操作化存在不一致性，亟需系统梳理。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南，系统检索了53项实证研究，分析内容包括代理类型、交互方式、方法论及测量工具，并基于结构化分类框架进行综述。

Result: 研究发现，多数研究依赖静态图像或假设场景，缺乏实时交互；信任测量多为主观指标。研究提出了一个基于最佳实践的信任测量分类框架。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统梳理了UVE与信任的关系，为未来研究提供了理论基础和方法指导，强调了交互动态性和测量工具改进的重要性。

Abstract: Trust is a fundamental component of human-agent interaction. With the
increasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to
understand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key
challenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where
increasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or
repelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research
varies widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized.
This inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what
conditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of
their relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact
of the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns,
limitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA
guidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that
investigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes.
Studies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types
of agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key
findings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on
static images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and
the majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel
framework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the
best-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE. As the first
systematic attempt to map the intersection of UVE and trust, this review
contributes to a deeper understanding of their interplay and offers a
foundation for future research. Keywords: the uncanny valley effect, trust,
human-likeness, affinity response, human-agent interaction

TL;DR: 研究评估了消费级可穿戴设备在压力检测中的性能，发现Biopac MP160表现最佳，但Garmin Forerunner 55s在实时监测中潜力显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨消费级可穿戴设备在压力检测中的可重复性和性能，填补现有研究多集中于单一数据集的空白。

Method: 通过新的压力研究，比较研究级设备（Biopac MP160、Polar H10、Empatica E4）与消费级设备（Garmin Forerunner 55s）的性能。

Result: Biopac MP160表现最优，但Garmin Forerunner 55s在实时监测中表现接近研究级设备，且更适合日常使用。

Conclusion: 消费级设备在压力检测中具有潜力，但硬件与模型的兼容性仍需优化。

Abstract: Wearable sensors are widely used to collect physiological data and develop
stress detection models. However, most studies focus on a single dataset,
rarely evaluating model reproducibility across devices, populations, or study
conditions. We previously assessed the reproducibility of stress detection
models across multiple studies, testing models trained on one dataset against
others using heart rate (with R-R interval) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
In this study, we extended our stress detection reproducibility to consumer
wearable sensors. We compared validated research-grade devices, to consumer
wearables - Biopac MP160, Polar H10, Empatica E4, to the Garmin Forerunner 55s,
assessing device-specific stress detection performance by conducting a new
stress study on undergraduate students. Thirty-five students completed three
standardized stress-induction tasks in a lab setting. Biopac MP160 performed
the best, being consistent with our expectations of it as the gold standard,
though performance varied across devices and models. Combining heart rate
variability (HRV) and EDA enhanced stress prediction across most scenarios.
However, Empatica E4 showed variability; while HRV and EDA improved stress
detection in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluations (AUROC up to 0.953),
device-specific limitations led to underperformance when tested with our
pre-trained stress detection tool (AUROC 0.723), highlighting generalizability
challenges related to hardware-model compatibility. Garmin Forerunner 55s
demonstrated strong potential for real-world stress monitoring, achieving the
best mental arithmetic stress detection performance in LOSO (AUROC up to 0.961)
comparable to research-grade devices like Polar H10 (AUROC 0.954), and Empatica
E4 (AUROC 0.905 with HRV-only model and AUROC 0.953 with HRV+EDA model), with
the added advantage of consumer-friendly wearability for free-living contexts.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs)
are recognized to have significant effects on industry and business dynamics,
not least because of their impact on the preconditions for entrepreneurship.
There is still a lack of knowledge of GenAI as a theme in entrepreneurship
research. This paper presents a systematic literature review aimed at
identifying and analyzing the evolving landscape of research on the effects of
GenAI on entrepreneurship. We analyze 83 peer-reviewed articles obtained from
leading academic databases: Web of Science and Scopus. Using natural language
processing and unsupervised machine learning techniques with TF-IDF
vectorization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering,
five major thematic clusters are identified: (1) Digital Transformation and
Behavioral Models, (2) GenAI-Enhanced Education and Learning Systems, (3)
Sustainable Innovation and Strategic AI Impact, (4) Business Models and Market
Trends, and (5) Data-Driven Technological Trends in Entrepreneurship. Based on
the review, we discuss future research directions, gaps in the current
literature, as well as ethical concerns raised in the literature. We highlight
the need for more macro-level research on GenAI and LLMs as external enablers
for entrepreneurship and for research on effective regulatory frameworks that
facilitate business experimentation, innovation, and further technology
development.

Abstract: This paper explores the hard problem of consciousness from a different
perspective. Instead of drawing distinctions between the physical and the
mental, an exploration of a more foundational relationship is examined: the
relationship between structure and quality.
  Information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual
determinability between structure and quality, including a novel Q-S space for
analyzing fidelity between the two domains. This novel space naturally points
toward a five-fold categorization of possible relationships between structural
and qualitative properties, illustrating each through conceptual and formal
models.
  The ontological implications of each category are examined, shedding light on
debates around functionalism, emergentism, idealism, panpsychism, and neutral
monism.
  This new line of inquiry has established a framework for deriving theoretical
constraints on qualitative systems undergoing evolution that is explored in my
companion paper, Qualia & Natural Selection.

Abstract: Autonomous AI is no longer a hard-to-reach concept, it enables the agents to
move beyond executing tasks to independently addressing complex problems,
adapting to change while handling the uncertainty of the environment. However,
what makes the agents truly autonomous? It is agentic reasoning, that is
crucial for foundation models to develop symbolic logic, statistical
correlations, or large-scale pattern recognition to process information, draw
inferences, and make decisions. However, it remains unclear why and how
existing agentic reasoning approaches work, in comparison to biological
reasoning, which instead is deeply rooted in neural mechanisms involving
hierarchical cognition, multimodal integration, and dynamic interactions. In
this work, we propose a novel neuroscience-inspired framework for agentic
reasoning. Grounded in three neuroscience-based definitions and supported by
mathematical and biological foundations, we propose a unified framework
modeling reasoning from perception to action, encompassing four core types,
perceptual, dimensional, logical, and interactive, inspired by distinct
functional roles observed in the human brain. We apply this framework to
systematically classify and analyze existing AI reasoning methods, evaluating
their theoretical foundations, computational designs, and practical
limitations. We also explore its implications for building more generalizable,
cognitively aligned agents in physical and virtual environments. Finally,
building on our framework, we outline future directions and propose new
neural-inspired reasoning methods, analogous to chain-of-thought prompting. By
bridging cognitive neuroscience and AI, this work offers a theoretical
foundation and practical roadmap for advancing agentic reasoning in intelligent
systems. The associated project can be found at:

Motivation: 传统乳腺癌筛查方法（如X光乳腺摄影）存在灵敏度、特异性不足及患者不适问题，而相位对比CT（PCT）虽能提供高质量图像，但需降低辐射剂量。

Method: 研究使用深度学习图像去噪技术处理PCT成像数据，对全新鲜乳腺切除样本进行实验。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed human cancer in the United
States at present. Early detection is crucial for its successful treatment.
X-ray mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are currently the main
methods for breast cancer screening. However, both have known limitations in
terms of their sensitivity and specificity to breast cancers, while also
frequently causing patient discomfort due to the requirement for breast
compression. Breast computed tomography is a promising alternative, however, to
obtain high-quality images, the X-ray dose needs to be sufficiently high. As
the breast is highly radiosensitive, dose reduction is particularly important.
Phase-contrast computed tomography (PCT) has been shown to produce
higher-quality images at lower doses and has no need for breast compression. It
is demonstrated in the present study that, when imaging full fresh mastectomy
samples with PCT, deep learning-based image denoising can further reduce the
radiation dose by a factor of 16 or more, without any loss of image quality.
The image quality has been assessed both in terms of objective metrics, such as
spatial resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, as well as in an observer study
by experienced medical imaging specialists and radiologists. This work was
carried out in preparation for live patient PCT breast cancer imaging,
initially at specialized synchrotron facilities.

Despite challenges in interpretability, ethics, data processing and evaluation,
the virtual eye holds the potential to revolutionize personalized ophthalmic

Motivation: 研究机器学习是否能够通过傅里叶系数预测模权重，以验证其在量子引力中自动检测对称性的能力。

Method: 训练前馈神经网络，基于Dedekind eta函数、Eisenstein级数和雅可比theta函数的傅里叶系数，预测模权重。

Result: 负权模形式和准模形式预测准确率高，正权模形式和复杂雅可比theta函数组合准确率较低。

Conclusion: 机器学习可用于识别模对称性，为量子引力中的对称性自动检测提供可能。

Abstract: Modular, Jacobi, and mock-modular forms serve as generating functions for BPS
black hole degeneracies. By training feed-forward neural networks on Fourier
coefficients of automorphic forms derived from the Dedekind eta function,
Eisenstein series, and Jacobi theta functions, we demonstrate that machine
learning techniques can accurately predict modular weights from truncated
expansions. Our results reveal strong performance for negative weight modular
and quasi-modular forms, particularly those arising in exact black hole
counting formulae, with lower accuracy for positive weights and more
complicated combinations of Jacobi theta functions. This study establishes a
proof of concept for using machine learning to identify how data is organized
in terms of modular symmetries in gravitational systems and suggests a pathway
toward automated detection and verification of symmetries in quantum gravity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的强大规划和推理能力带来了安全风险，尤其是间接提示注入攻击，需要一种自动化方法来发现和利用这些漏洞。

Method: 通过构建高质量初始种子语料库，结合基于MCTS的种子选择算法迭代优化输入，最大化发现代理弱点的可能性。

Result: 在AgentDojo和VWA-adv基准测试中，分别达到71%和70%的成功率，攻击性能接近基线方法的两倍。

Conclusion: AgentXploit不仅高效且具有广泛适用性，还能在现实环境中成功误导代理，展示了其实际威胁潜力。

Abstract: The strong planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) have fostered the development of agent-based systems capable of
leveraging external tools and interacting with increasingly complex
environments. However, these powerful features also introduce a critical
security risk: indirect prompt injection, a sophisticated attack vector that
compromises the core of these agents, the LLM, by manipulating contextual
information rather than direct user prompts. In this work, we propose a generic
black-box fuzzing framework, AgentXploit, designed to automatically discover
and exploit indirect prompt injection vulnerabilities across diverse LLM
agents. Our approach starts by constructing a high-quality initial seed corpus,
then employs a seed selection algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
to iteratively refine inputs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of uncovering
agent weaknesses. We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo
and VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based
on o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of
baseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across
unseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses.
Beyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments,
successfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including
malicious sites.

TL;DR: 论文提出LiteLMGuard（LLMG），一种用于量化小型语言模型（SLM）的实时提示防护系统，旨在解决SLM因压缩技术带来的公平性、伦理和隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，小型语言模型（SLM）因其轻量化特性被部署在边缘设备上，但压缩技术可能引入安全风险，如直接响应有害查询。

Method: LLMG通过深度学习模型（ELECTRA）对提示进行分类，判断是否应由SLM回答，使用自建数据集Answerable-or-Not进行训练。

Result: LLMG能防御87%以上的有害提示，包括直接指令和越狱攻击，过滤准确率达94%，平均延迟135毫秒。

Conclusion: LLMG为量化SLM提供了高效、低延迟的实时防护，显著提升了安全性和用户体验。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the
development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to
enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs
offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and
improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device
environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like
quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy
risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly,
without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and
trust concerns.
  To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard
that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally,
our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be
seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying
architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning
(DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic
understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using
our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL
models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability
classification accuracy.
  Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against
over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak
attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open
Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without
adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG
achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average
latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.

Result: 建立了全面的攻击与防御分类法，并识别了SL中的关键挑战和研究空白。

Conclusion: 研究为SL的安全性提供了系统性视角，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed deep
learning, allowing resource-constrained clients to offload portions of their
model computation to servers while maintaining collaborative learning. However,
recent research has demonstrated that SL remains vulnerable to a range of
privacy and security threats, including information leakage, model inversion,
and adversarial attacks. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, a
systematic understanding of the attack landscape and corresponding
countermeasures is still lacking. In this study, we present a comprehensive
taxonomy of attacks and defenses in SL, categorizing them along three key
dimensions: employed strategies, constraints, and effectiveness. Furthermore,
we identify key open challenges and research gaps in SL based on our
systematization, highlighting potential future directions.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在文本理解和生成方面表现出色，但其在推理服务中可能泄露敏感用户数据的问题引发担忧。现有解决方案在效率、隐私和效用之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出Cape机制，包括混合效用函数以更好地捕捉标记相似性，以及桶化采样机制处理大采样空间。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Cape在隐私与效用权衡上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Cape通过上下文感知提示扰动机制，显著提升了隐私保护与模型效用的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their
remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. However, despite
their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns
about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing
solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such
risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow
this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based
on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved
privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function
that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a
bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead
to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along
with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility
trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.

TL;DR: DaringFed是一种动态贝叶斯说服定价机制，用于在线联邦学习（OFL）中的激励设计，解决了动态不完全信息（TII）下的资源分配问题，显著提升了模型准确性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在OFL中，激励客户端参与训练需要动态奖励机制，但由于服务器和客户端之间的动态不完全信息（TII），传统激励设计难以适用。

Method: 提出DaringFed，将服务器与客户端的交互建模为动态信号和定价分配问题，并证明贝叶斯说服纳什均衡的存在性，推导出最优设计。

Result: 实验表明，DaringFed在真实数据集上优化了16.99%的准确性和收敛速度，合成数据集上验证了其提升服务器效用的有效性（最高12.6%）。

Conclusion: DaringFed为OFL中的动态激励设计提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了学习效率和服务器效用。

Abstract: Online Federated Learning (OFL) is a real-time learning paradigm that
sequentially executes parameter aggregation immediately for each random
arriving client. To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to
offer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption.
However, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the
dynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning
resources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing
computational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time
communication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to
participate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we
design a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated
learning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the
interaction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing
allocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the
existence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the
optimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further
analyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under
TII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that
DaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments
with synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and
the effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to
12.6%.

Abstract: Most web and digital trace data do not include information about an
individual's nationality due to privacy concerns. The lack of data on
nationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a
left-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of
origin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can
differentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the
nationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the
detected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which
is a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6
million unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into
families of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training
data. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1
score of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level
categorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to
assign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our
results show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for
nationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries
with a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.
We found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once
we used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic
origin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has
consistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have
Chinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin. Our proposed
methods for addressing left-censoring issues are beneficial for other research
that uses digital trace data to study migration.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI（如大语言模型）需求的增长，需要优化计算效率和能耗的专用硬件架构。

Method: 详细分析了Grayskull的执行模型、网格大小、矩阵维度、数据格式和数值精度对计算效率的影响。

Result: NVIDIA GPU在性能上占优，但Grayskull在功耗与计算吞吐量之间表现出竞争力，BF16精度下峰值达1.55 TFLOPs/Watt。

Conclusion: Grayskull在能效方面具有潜力，适合对功耗敏感的应用场景。

Abstract: The increasing demand for generative AI as Large Language Models (LLMs)
services has driven the need for specialized hardware architectures that
optimize computational efficiency and energy consumption. This paper evaluates
the performance of the Tenstorrent Grayskull e75 RISC-V accelerator for basic
linear algebra kernels at reduced numerical precision, a fundamental operation
in LLM computations. We present a detailed characterization of Grayskull's
execution model, gridsize, matrix dimensions, data formats, and numerical
precision impact computational efficiency. Furthermore, we compare Grayskull's
performance against state-of-the-art architectures with tensor acceleration,
including Intel Sapphire Rapids processors and two NVIDIA GPUs (V100 and A100).
Whilst NVIDIA GPUs dominate raw performance, Grayskull demonstrates a
competitive trade-off between power consumption and computational throughput,
reaching a peak of 1.55 TFLOPs/Watt with BF16.

*Mohamed Salah Bouafif,Mohammad Hamdaqa,Edward Zulkoski*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PRIMG框架通过突变优先级和测试生成模块，显著减少测试套件规模并保持高突变覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突变测试通常导致测试套件过大，增加计算开销。PRIMG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PRIMG结合突变优先级模块（基于机器学习）和测试生成模块（利用LLM），增量生成和优化测试用例。

Result: 实验显示PRIMG减少测试套件规模，保持高突变覆盖率，并提升测试用例质量。

Conclusion: PRIMG有效优化突变测试，提升测试效率和质量。

Abstract: Mutation testing is a widely recognized technique for assessing and enhancing
the effectiveness of software test suites by introducing deliberate code
mutations. However, its application often results in overly large test suites,
as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing
computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and
Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for
incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts.
PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which
employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to
predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module,
which utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine
test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness.
  We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess
its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test
cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces
test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization
module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the
generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore,
the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated
tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex
program logic.

TL;DR: SCoPE2是SCoPE框架的增强版，显著提升了代码预处理效率，并优化了大型语言模型在漏洞检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于代码功能实现形式多样，需要高效的预处理工具标准化代码表示，以支持跨语言和新型转换。

Method: 基于SCoPE框架开发SCoPE2，比较两者在处理时间、内存占用及对LLM漏洞检测的影响。

Result: SCoPE2处理时间减少97.3%，且LLM的F1分数因预处理改进而提升。

Conclusion: SCoPE2在代码预处理和漏洞检测中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: The application of Artificial Intelligence has become a powerful approach to
detecting software vulnerabilities. However, effective vulnerability detection
relies on accurately capturing the semantic structure of code and its
contextual relationships. Given that the same functionality can be implemented
in various forms, a preprocessing tool that standardizes code representation is
important. This tool must be efficient, adaptable across programming languages,
and capable of supporting new transformations. To address this challenge, we
build on the existing SCoPE framework and introduce SCoPE2, an enhanced version
with improved performance. We compare both versions in terms of processing time
and memory usage and evaluate their impact on a Large Language Model (LLM) for
vulnerability detection. Our results show a 97.3\% reduction in processing time
with SCoPE2, along with an improved F1-score for the LLM, solely due to the
refined preprocessing approach.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种自动化数据提取管道，利用LLMs和IRZ-CoT提示技术，结合RAV验证过程，显著提高了高风险行业的环境影响数据提取准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟《无毁林条例》(EUDR)要求企业证明其产品不导致毁林，但现有数据库缺乏详细数据，限制了合规性和环境建模的准确性。

Method: 研究开发了一个端到端数据提取管道，采用IRZ-CoT提示技术和RAV验证过程，应用于SEC EDGAR文件中的高风险行业。

Result: 管道在提取准确性和验证覆盖范围上显著优于传统零样本提示方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为监管合规、CSR和ESG提供了NLP驱动的自动化解决方案，具有广泛的行业适用性。

Abstract: The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) requires companies to
prove their products do not contribute to deforestation, creating a critical
demand for precise, asset-level environmental impact data. Current databases
lack the necessary detail, relying heavily on broad financial metrics and
manual data collection, which limits regulatory compliance and accurate
environmental modeling. This study presents an automated, end-to-end data
extraction pipeline that uses LLMs to create, clean, and validate structured
databases, specifically targeting sectors with a high risk of deforestation.
The pipeline introduces Instructional, Role-Based, Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought
(IRZ-CoT) prompting to enhance data extraction accuracy and a
Retrieval-Augmented Validation (RAV) process that integrates real-time web
searches for improved data reliability. Applied to SEC EDGAR filings in the
Mining, Oil & Gas, and Utilities sectors, the pipeline demonstrates significant
improvements over traditional zero-shot prompting approaches, particularly in
extraction accuracy and validation coverage. This work advances NLP-driven
automation for regulatory compliance, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility),
and ESG, with broad sectoral applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的两阶段用户画像方法，通过领域定义语句生成可解释的用户画像，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像技术存在可迁移性差、特征不可解释、依赖大量标注数据或预定义类别等问题，需要一种更灵活、可解释且适应性强的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）半监督过滤结合领域知识库；2）生成抽象（合成描述）和抽取（代表性推文选择）用户画像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在波斯政治Twitter数据集上比现有LLM和传统方法性能提升9.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过LLM的知识和最小人工验证，生成灵活、可解释的用户画像，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: Social media user profiling through content analysis is crucial for tasks
like misinformation detection, engagement prediction, hate speech monitoring,
and user behavior modeling. However, existing profiling techniques, including
tweet summarization, attribute-based profiling, and latent representation
learning, face significant limitations: they often lack transferability,
produce non-interpretable features, require large labeled datasets, or rely on
rigid predefined categories that limit adaptability. We introduce a novel large
language model (LLM)-based approach that leverages domain-defining statements,
which serve as key characteristics outlining the important pillars of a domain
as foundations for profiling. Our two-stage method first employs
semi-supervised filtering with a domain-specific knowledge base, then generates
both abstractive (synthesized descriptions) and extractive (representative
tweet selections) user profiles. By harnessing LLMs' inherent knowledge with
minimal human validation, our approach is adaptable across domains while
reducing the need for large labeled datasets. Our method generates
interpretable natural language user profiles, condensing extensive user data
into a scale that unlocks LLMs' reasoning and knowledge capabilities for
downstream social network tasks. We contribute a Persian political Twitter (X)
dataset and an LLM-based evaluation framework with human validation.
Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based and traditional methods by 9.8%, demonstrating its effectiveness in
creating flexible, adaptable, and interpretable user profiles.

Result: 模型在重叠社区检测中表现优异（NMI和F1分数提升），对属性噪声具有强鲁棒性（60%特征损坏下性能稳定）。

Conclusion: 整合属性语义和结构模式对复杂网络中准确社区发现至关重要。

Abstract: Community detection in networks with overlapping structures remains a
significant challenge, particularly in noisy real-world environments where
integrating topology, node attributes, and prior information is critical. To
address this, we propose a semi-supervised graph autoencoder that combines
graph multi-head attention and modularity maximization to robustly detect
overlapping communities. The model learns semantic representations by fusing
structural, attribute, and prior knowledge while explicitly addressing noise in
node features. Key innovations include a noise-resistant architecture and a
semantic semi-supervised design optimized for community quality through
modularity constraints. Experiments demonstrate superior performance the model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in overlapping community detection
(improvements in NMI and F1-score) and exhibits exceptional robustness to
attribute noise, maintaining stable performance under 60\% feature corruption.
These results highlight the importance of integrating attribute semantics and
structural patterns for accurate community discovery in complex networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用机器学习提供的建议（部分最优解信息）来改进经典SAT问题的算法性能，超越最坏情况分析的限制。

Method: 使用子集建议（随机提供部分变量的最优赋值）和标签建议（提供所有变量的噪声预测）来加速PPSZ算法的运行时间，并改进近似算法的近似比。

Result: 对于决策问题，子集建议将PPSZ算法的指数运行时间加速了乘法因子；对于优化问题，子集建议显著提高了近似比。标签建议则在平均度数大的实例中实现了接近最优的近似。

Conclusion: 学习增强算法能够有效利用机器学习提供的建议，显著提升SAT问题的算法性能，为实际应用提供了新的优化途径。

Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms are a prominent recent development in beyond
worst-case analysis. In this framework, a problem instance is provided with a
prediction (``advice'') from a machine-learning oracle, which provides partial
information about an optimal solution, and the goal is to design algorithms
that leverage this advice to improve worst-case performance. We study the
classic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) decision and optimization problems within
this framework using two forms of advice. ``Subset advice" provides a random
$\epsilon$ fraction of the variables from an optimal assignment, whereas
``label advice" provides noisy predictions for all variables in an optimal
assignment.
  For the decision problem $k$-SAT, by using the subset advice we accelerate
the exponential running time of the PPSZ family of algorithms due to Paturi,
Pudlak, Saks and Zane, which currently represent the state of the art in the
worst case. We accelerate the running time by a multiplicative factor of
$2^{-c}$ in the base of the exponent, where $c$ is a function of $\epsilon$ and
$k$. For the optimization problem, we show how to incorporate subset advice in
a black-box fashion with any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm, improving the
approximation ratio to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)\epsilon$. Specifically, we
achieve approximations of $0.94 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$2$-SAT, $7/8 +
\Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$3$-SAT, and $0.79 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-SAT.
Moreover, for label advice, we obtain near-optimal approximation for instances
with large average degree, thereby generalizing recent results on MAX-CUT and
MAX-$2$-LIN.

TL;DR: 论文首次应用机器学习管道$	exttt{cecilia}$分析五颗金属污染白矮星的物理参数和光球组成，通过联合贝叶斯拟合光谱数据，测量了多种元素丰度，结果与原始CI球粒陨石一致，并发现氧过剩现象。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习技术分析缺乏元素丰度数据的金属污染白矮星，以揭示其污染物组成及可能的系外行星物质来源。

Method: 采用联合迭代贝叶斯拟合方法分析$	extit{SDSS}$和$	extit{Keck/ESI}$光谱数据，覆盖3800-9000Å波长范围。

Result: 测量了2-6种元素丰度，精度与传统方法相当（≈0.20 dex），污染物组成与CI球粒陨石一致，发现SDSS J0859+5732和SDSS J2311-0041存在显著氧过剩。

Conclusion: $	exttt{cecilia}$有望在未来大规模光谱数据中解锁污染白矮星的群体研究，提升对系外物质组成的统计认识。

Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
$\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric
composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without
well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint
and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and
$\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range
from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at
least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a
predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques
($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy
elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously
exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all
systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely
consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also
find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for
SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of
oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical
surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,
$\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,
therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar
compositions.
