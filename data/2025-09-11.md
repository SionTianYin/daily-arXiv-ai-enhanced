### [1] [Bilingual Word Level Language Identification for Omotic Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07998)
*Mesay Gemeda Yigezu,Girma Yohannis Bade,Atnafu Lambebo Tonja,Olga Kolesnikova,Grigori Sidorov,Alexander Gelbukh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对埃塞俄比亚南部的Wolaita和Gofa双语识别任务，提出结合BERT预训练模型和LSTM的方法，在测试集上获得0.72的F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言社区中，文本常包含多种语言，而Wolaita和Gofa语言之间存在词汇相似性和差异性，使得语言识别任务具有挑战性

Method: 采用多种实验方法，最终确定BERT预训练语言模型与LSTM结合的方法

Result: 在测试集上获得0.72的F1分数，表现最佳

Conclusion: 该工作能有效处理社交媒体中的多语言问题，并为该领域进一步研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language identification is the task of determining the languages for a given
text. In many real world scenarios, text may contain more than one language,
particularly in multilingual communities. Bilingual Language Identification
(BLID) is the task of identifying and distinguishing between two languages in a
given text. This paper presents BLID for languages spoken in the southern part
of Ethiopia, namely Wolaita and Gofa. The presence of words similarities and
differences between the two languages makes the language identification task
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we employed various experiments on
various approaches. Then, the combination of the BERT based pretrained language
model and LSTM approach performed better, with an F1 score of 0.72 on the test
set. As a result, the work will be effective in tackling unwanted social media
issues and providing a foundation for further research in this area.

### [2] [AntiDote: Bi-level Adversarial Training for Tamper-Resistant LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08000)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Manodeep Ray,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AntiDote是一种双层优化方法，通过对抗性超网络训练LLM抵抗恶意微调攻击，在保持模型能力的同时显著提升安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源权重LLM面临恶意微调生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施难以在完全模型访问权限下有效防护

Method: 使用辅助对抗超网络生成恶意LoRA权重，通过双层优化训练防御模型来抵消这些对抗性权重的影响

Result: 在52种红队攻击测试中，AntiDote比基准方法强27.4%，能力基准性能下降小于0.5%

Conclusion: 该方法为构建安全且实用的开源权重模型提供了计算高效的方法论

Abstract: The release of open-weight large language models (LLMs) creates a tension
between advancing accessible research and preventing misuse, such as malicious
fine-tuning to elicit harmful content. Current safety measures struggle to
preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined
adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use
full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we
introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be
resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary
hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender
LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these
adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We
validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks,
including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct
weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\% more robust against adversarial
attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially,
this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a
performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\% across capability benchmarks
including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K. Our work offers a practical and compute
efficient methodology for building open-weight models where safety is a more
integral and resilient property.

### [3] [MVPBench: A Benchmark and Fine-Tuning Framework for Aligning Large Language Models with Diverse Human Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08022)
*Yao Liang,Dongcheng Zhao,Feifei Zhao,Guobin Shen,Yuwei Wang,Dongqi Liang,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MVPBench是一个包含75个国家24,020个实例的基准测试，用于系统评估大语言模型在多维人类价值观上的对齐表现，揭示了模型在不同地理和人口统计群体间的显著差异，并证明轻量级微调方法能有效提升价值对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往忽视文化和人口统计多样性，导致对大语言模型价值对齐在全球范围内泛化能力的理解有限。

Method: 开发MVPBench基准测试，包含24,020个高质量实例，带有细粒度价值标签、个性化问题和丰富的人口统计元数据，并对多个先进大语言模型进行深入分析，测试LoRA和DPO等轻量级微调方法的效果。

Result: 发现大语言模型在不同地理和人口统计群体间存在显著的对齐性能差异，轻量级微调方法在域内和域外设置中都能显著提升价值对齐效果。

Conclusion: 需要进行群体感知的对齐评估，MVPBench为全球对齐、个性化价值建模和公平AI发展的未来研究提供了实用基础。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical
for their safe and effective deployment across diverse user populations.
However, existing benchmarks often neglect cultural and demographic diversity,
leading to limited understanding of how value alignment generalizes globally.
In this work, we introduce MVPBench, a novel benchmark that systematically
evaluates LLMs' alignment with multi-dimensional human value preferences across
75 countries. MVPBench contains 24,020 high-quality instances annotated with
fine-grained value labels, personalized questions, and rich demographic
metadata, making it the most comprehensive resource of its kind to date. Using
MVPBench, we conduct an in-depth analysis of several state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing substantial disparities in alignment performance across geographic
and demographic lines. We further demonstrate that lightweight fine-tuning
methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), can significantly enhance value alignment in both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Our findings underscore the necessity for
population-aware alignment evaluation and provide actionable insights for
building culturally adaptive and value-sensitive LLMs. MVPBench serves as a
practical foundation for future research on global alignment, personalized
value modeling, and equitable AI development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOWJ团队在COLIEE 2025竞赛中采用混合方法，结合传统信息检索技术和现代生成模型，在Legal Case Entailment任务中获得第一名，并在其他四个法律信息处理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将传统信息检索技术与先进的大语言模型相结合，提升法律信息处理的准确性和效率，为法律人工智能领域提供有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段检索系统：第一阶段使用预排序模型（BM25、BERT、monoT5）和基于嵌入的语义表示（BGE-m3、LLM2Vec）进行词汇语义过滤；第二阶段使用大语言模型（Qwen-2、QwQ-32B、DeepSeek-V3）进行摘要、相关性评分和上下文重排序。

Result: 在Legal Case Entailment任务中获得第一名，F1分数为0.3195；在其他四个任务（案例检索、法规检索、法律文本蕴含、法律判决预测）中也表现出色。

Conclusion: 混合模型整合传统IR技术和现代生成模型在法律信息处理中具有巨大潜力，为未来该领域的发展提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: This paper presents the methodologies and results of the NOWJ team's
participation across all five tasks at the COLIEE 2025 competition, emphasizing
advancements in the Legal Case Entailment task (Task 2). Our comprehensive
approach systematically integrates pre-ranking models (BM25, BERT, monoT5),
embedding-based semantic representations (BGE-m3, LLM2Vec), and advanced Large
Language Models (Qwen-2, QwQ-32B, DeepSeek-V3) for summarization, relevance
scoring, and contextual re-ranking. Specifically, in Task 2, our two-stage
retrieval system combined lexical-semantic filtering with contextualized LLM
analysis, achieving first place with an F1 score of 0.3195. Additionally, in
other tasks--including Legal Case Retrieval, Statute Law Retrieval, Legal
Textual Entailment, and Legal Judgment Prediction--we demonstrated robust
performance through carefully engineered ensembles and effective prompt-based
reasoning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of hybrid models
integrating traditional IR techniques with contemporary generative models,
providing a valuable reference for future advancements in legal information
processing.

### [5] [SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08032)
*Fengyu She,Nan Wang,Hongfei Wu,Ziyi Wan,Jingmian Wang,Chang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciGPT是一个针对科学文献理解优化的领域自适应基础模型，通过低成本的领域蒸馏、稀疏专家混合注意力机制和知识感知适应等创新技术，在科学任务上超越GPT-4o表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献呈指数级增长，研究人员需要高效合成知识。通用大语言模型在处理科学文本时难以捕捉领域特定细微差别（如技术术语、方法严谨性），限制了其在跨学科研究中的实用性。

Method: 基于Qwen3架构，采用三阶段创新：(1)两阶段低成本的领域蒸馏管道平衡性能与效率；(2)稀疏专家混合注意力机制，在32,000个token的长文档推理中减少55%内存消耗；(3)集成领域本体的知识感知适应，弥合跨学科知识差距。

Result: 在ScienceBench基准测试中，SciGPT在序列标注、生成和推理等核心科学任务上优于GPT-4o，并在未见过的科学任务中表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SciGPT验证了其在促进AI增强科学发现方面的潜力，为科学文献理解提供了高效的领域自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.

*Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Paul Röttger,Nino Scherrer,Emanuele Borgonovo,Elmar Plischke,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型个性化可能导致假拒绝问题，但研究发现这个问题被高估了，模型能力提升后人设影响减小，而模型选择和任务类型影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和量化大语言模型个性化可能导致的假拒绝问题，以及不同社会人口学特征对模型拒绝行为的影响。

Method: 使用15种社会人口学人设（基于性别、种族、宗教、残疾），在16个不同模型上测试三种任务（自然语言推理、礼貌和冒犯性分类），使用蒙特卡洛方法高效量化假拒绝问题。

Result: 模型能力越强，人设对拒绝率的影响越小；某些社会人口学人设在某些模型中会增加假拒绝，显示对齐策略或安全机制存在偏见；模型选择和任务类型对假拒绝有显著影响，尤其是在敏感内容任务中。

Conclusion: 人设效应被高估了，假拒绝问题可能更多是由其他因素导致的；模型能力提升有助于减少人设影响，但对齐策略和安全机制中的偏见需要进一步关注。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into our daily lives
and personalized. However, LLM personalization might also increase unintended
side effects. Recent work suggests that persona prompting can lead models to
falsely refuse user requests. However, no work has fully quantified the extent
of this issue. To address this gap, we measure the impact of 15
sociodemographic personas (based on gender, race, religion, and disability) on
false refusal. To control for other factors, we also test 16 different models,
3 tasks (Natural Language Inference, politeness, and offensiveness
classification), and nine prompt paraphrases. We propose a Monte Carlo-based
method to quantify this issue in a sample-efficient manner. Our results show
that as models become more capable, personas impact the refusal rate less and
less. Certain sociodemographic personas increase false refusal in some models,
which suggests underlying biases in the alignment strategies or safety
mechanisms. However, we find that the model choice and task significantly
influence false refusals, especially in sensitive content tasks. Our findings
suggest that persona effects have been overestimated, and might be due to other
factors.

*Nathaniel Imel,Noga Zaslavsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型能够通过信息瓶颈原则演化出类似人类的高效语义系统，在颜色命名任务中表现出与人类相似的压缩效率和跨语言模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能够像人类语言系统一样，通过信息瓶颈原则演化出高效的语义分类系统，而不是仅仅模仿训练数据中的模式

Method: 使用Gemini 2.0-flash和Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct模型，复现两个重要的人类行为研究：英语颜色命名研究和通过上下文学习模拟文化演化过程

Result: Gemini与英语母语者的命名模式高度一致且达到很高的IB效率分数，Llama表现出高效但复杂度较低的系统；两种模型都能通过迭代学习将随机系统重构为更高IB效率的系统

Conclusion: LLMs能够演化出基于感知的人类化语义系统，其驱动力与支配人类语言语义效率的基本原理相同

Abstract: Converging evidence suggests that systems of semantic categories across human
languages achieve near-optimal compression via the Information Bottleneck (IB)
complexity-accuracy principle. Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for
this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving
efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on
the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization
and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two
influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming
study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native
English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while
Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English.
Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or
actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate
cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated
in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively
restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and
increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These
findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded,
human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that
governs semantic efficiency across human languages.

*Kosei Uemura,David Guzmán,Quang Phuoc Nguyen,Jesujoba Oluwadara Alabi,En-shiun Annie Lee,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MERLIN是一个两阶段模型堆叠框架，通过课程学习策略（从通用双语文本到任务特定数据）和仅适配少量DoRA权重，显著提升低资源语言的复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编码器-解码器方法（如LangBridge和MindMerger）在中高资源语言上表现良好，但在低资源语言上仍存在较大性能差距，需要专门针对低资源语言复杂推理的解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段模型堆叠框架：1）课程学习策略，从通用双语文本开始训练，逐步过渡到任务特定数据；2）仅适配少量DoRA（Domain-Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation）权重，实现高效参数微调。

Result: 在AfriMGSM基准上，MERLIN比MindMerger准确率提升12.9个百分点，优于GPT-4o-mini；在MGSM和MSVAMP基准上也分别获得0.9和2.8个百分点的稳定提升，证明在低资源和高资源环境下均有效。

Conclusion: MERLIN框架通过精心设计的课程学习和参数高效微调策略，成功解决了低资源语言复杂推理的挑战，为多语言NLP任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel in English but still struggle with complex
reasoning in many low-resource languages (LRLs). Existing encoder-plus-decoder
methods such as LangBridge and MindMerger raise accuracy on mid and
high-resource languages, yet they leave a large gap on LRLs. We present MERLIN,
a two-stage model-stacking framework that applies a curriculum learning
strategy -- from general bilingual bitext to task-specific data -- and adapts
only a small set of DoRA weights. On the AfriMGSM benchmark MERLIN improves
exact-match accuracy by +12.9 pp over MindMerger and outperforms GPT-4o-mini.
It also yields consistent gains on MGSM and MSVAMP (+0.9 and +2.8 pp),
demonstrating effectiveness across both low and high-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现假设假设错误：假设错误认为偏见不会从预训练大语言模型传递到适配后的模型。研究证明通过提示调整，偏见可以传递，并且常见的提示消除偏见方法无法一致防止偏见传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 证明偏见传递假设的错误认识，因为提示调整是实际应用中极其流行和易用的适配策略，需要研究偏见在这种情况下的传递问题。

Method: 在因果模型中研究提示适配下的偏见传递假设，分析了不同人口统计学特征和任务中的偏见相关性，并评估多种提示基于的消除偏见策略。

Result: 发现偏见在提示适配中保持中等到强相关性（如性别相关性≥0.94，年龄≥0.98，宗教≥0.69），并且在变化少样本组成参数时仍保持强相关性（≥0.90）。不同消除偏见策略有不同优势，但无法一致减少偏见传递。

Conclusion: 约正内在模型中的偏见，可能防止偏见向下游任务传播，同时也可能提高推理能力。

Abstract: A dangerous assumption that can be made from prior work on the bias transfer
hypothesis (BTH) is that biases do not transfer from pre-trained large language
models (LLMs) to adapted models. We invalidate this assumption by studying the
BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely
popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In
contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and
that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases
from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and
those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and
tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age
(rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we
find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition
parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational
distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several
prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have
distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models,
tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and
potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent
propagation of biases to downstream tasks.

*Supriya Lall,Christian Farrell,Hari Pathanjaly,Marko Pavic,Sarvesh Chezhian,Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出verbalized algorithms (VAs)方法，将复杂任务分解为LLM可可靠执行的简单自然语言操作，使用经典算法框架来保证理论可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性查询LLM方式对于推理任务不可靠，需要一种更可靠的方法来利用LLM的能力

Method: 使用经典算法（如双调排序网络）作为框架，将LLM作为二元比较器使用，限制LLM只执行简单的自然语言字符串操作

Result: 在排序和聚类任务上证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: verbalized algorithms提供了一种可靠利用LLM进行推理任务的新范式，通过结合经典算法理论保证和LLM的自然语言处理能力

Abstract: Instead of querying LLMs in a one-shot manner and hoping to get the right
answer for a reasoning task, we propose a paradigm we call \emph{verbalized
algorithms} (VAs), which leverage classical algorithms with established
theoretical understanding. VAs decompose a task into simple elementary
operations on natural language strings that they should be able to answer
reliably, and limit the scope of LLMs to only those simple tasks. For example,
for sorting a series of natural language strings, \emph{verbalized sorting}
uses an LLM as a binary comparison oracle in a known and well-analyzed sorting
algorithm (e.g., bitonic sorting network). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach on sorting and clustering tasks.

*Eve Fleisig,Matthias Orlikowski,Philipp Cimiano,Dan Klein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 主观标注任务中，传统垃圾注解过滤方法容易删除合理不同意见，而非真正垃圾。保守设置（<5%删除率）效果最佳，垃圾注解者通常更不随机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡注解者可靠性和标签多样性，确保机器学习数据集准确反映人群多样化观点

Method: 对比多种注解者过滤偏好策略，使用合成垃圾数据进行实验分析

Result: 传统方法容易删除合理不同意见，保守设置效果最佳，垃圾注解者更不随机且更可预测

Conclusion: 需要考虑标签多样性的垃圾滤除新方法，传统方法在主观任务中偏向认定变异为垃圾

Abstract: For machine learning datasets to accurately represent diverse opinions in a
population, they must preserve variation in data labels while filtering out
spam or low-quality responses. How can we balance annotator reliability and
representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator
filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find
that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single
ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree
instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy
and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal
(<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error
from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to
observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than
real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable
from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give
fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of
variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers
tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is
spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that
account for label diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同格式文档间的信息共享方式对信息检索、摘要生成等任务至关重要。需要一种方法来分类和模型文档间的语义覆盖关系。

Method: 采用问题回答方法，通过文档间共享问题的可回答性来表征语义覆盖关系。使用SQuAD语料库构建合成数据集，通过重写源文本和选择性省略信息来控制内容重叠程度。

Result: 判别模型表现明显优于生成模型，RoBERTa-base模型达到61.4%的最高准确率，Random Forest模型在平衡性方面表现最佳（宏观F1分数52.9%）。

Conclusion: 问题回答方法为评估不同风格文本间的语义关系提供了有效视角，为理解现有模型如何进行深层信息推理提供了见解。研究数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the
format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information
retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which
classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We
define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same
information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one
document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic
overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture
these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the
answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic
coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by
paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling
precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark
generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR
prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly
outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the
highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best
balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an
effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse
texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about
information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this
study are publicly available to support reproducibility.

*Sergey Pletenev,Daniil Moskovskiy,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型生成的毒性合成数据无法替代人工数据进行去毒训练，性能下降达30%，主要原因是词汇多样性不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM生成的合成毒性数据是否可以替代人工数据用于文本去毒训练

Method: 使用Llama 3和Qwen激活补丁模型为ParaDetox和SST-2数据集生成合成毒性文本，对比人工数据训练的去毒模型性能

Result: 使用合成数据训练的模型性能一致更差，聚合指标下降达30%，词汇多样性缺口是关键问题

Conclusion: 当前LLM在毒性生成领域有限制，人工注释的多样化数据对建立健壮去毒系统仍至关重要

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are excellent at generating synthetic
data. However, their performance in sensitive domains such as text
detoxification has not received proper attention from the scientific community.
This paper explores the possibility of using LLM-generated synthetic toxic data
as an alternative to human-generated data for training models for
detoxification. Using Llama 3 and Qwen activation-patched models, we generated
synthetic toxic counterparts for neutral texts from ParaDetox and SST-2
datasets. Our experiments show that models fine-tuned on synthetic data
consistently perform worse than those trained on human data, with a drop in
performance of up to 30% in joint metrics. The root cause is identified as a
critical lexical diversity gap: LLMs generate toxic content using a small,
repetitive vocabulary of insults that fails to capture the nuances and variety
of human toxicity. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in
this domain and emphasize the continued importance of diverse, human-annotated
data for building robust detoxification systems.

*Yu Cheng Chih,Yong Hao Hou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETLCH是一个基于LLaMA的十亿参数模型，通过少量样本（每任务几百到一千个样本）进行低秩适应微调，在JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别任务中表现出色，以较低计算成本实现稳定的结构化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在结构化数据提取领域部署成本高且需要大量高质量数据，小团队难以承担。现有研究主要关注70亿参数以上的大模型，缺乏对小模型在低资源多任务条件下性能的证据。

Method: 基于LLaMA架构构建十亿参数模型ETLCH，使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术，仅用每任务几百到一千个样本进行微调，针对JSON提取、知识图谱提取和命名实体识别三个任务。

Result: ETLCH在大多数评估指标上优于强基线模型，即使在最低数据规模下也观察到显著增益，证明了小模型在低计算成本下能够提供稳定准确的结构化输出。

Conclusion: 精心调优的小型模型能够在资源受限环境中以较低计算成本实现可靠的信息提取，为小团队提供了成本效益高的结构化数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in
domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and
multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams
due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of
preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies
focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on
whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task
conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model
fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand
samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named
entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines
across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the
lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can
deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the
computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction
pipelines in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的语音关系提取框架RPG-MoGe和大规模真实人语音数据集CommonVoice-SpeechRE，解决了现有模型在生成模板和语义对齐方面的限制，并在性能上超越了最新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音关系提取数据集主要依赖合成数据，缺乏真实人语音的数量和多样性，同时现有模型存在单一生成模板和弱语义对齐问题，限制了性能。

Method: 提出RPG-MoGe框架：(1)多序三元组生成集成策略，利用不同元素排序来增加数据多样性；(2)CNN基于的隐含关系预测头，生成显式关系提示来指导跨模态对齐和准确三元组生成。同时构建了包含近20,000个真实人语音样本的CommonVoice-SpeechRE数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在性能上超过了目前最先进的方法，为真实世界语音关系提取提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音关系提取领域提供了新的标准数据集和高效框架，通过多序生成策略和显式关系提示机制，有效提升了语音关系提取的性能。

Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets
directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on
synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech.
Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation
templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their
performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a
large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from
diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research.
Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative
Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet
generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element
orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation
prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal
alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an
effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.

Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，自动事实核查系统容易受到对抗性攻击的操纵，但目前缺乏对这些攻击策略和防御方法的全面概述。

Method: 对现有对抗性攻击方法进行分类和评估，分析攻击对事实核查系统的影响，并研究最新的对抗性感知防御技术。

Result: 发现当前事实核查模型在面对对抗性攻击时存在脆弱性，需要开发更具弹性的框架来保持高验证准确性。

Conclusion: 迫切需要建立能够抵御对抗性操纵的稳健事实核查框架，以维护信息验证的可靠性。

Abstract: In an era where misinformation spreads freely, fact-checking (FC) plays a
crucial role in verifying claims and promoting reliable information. While
automated fact-checking (AFC) has advanced significantly, existing systems
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate or generate claims,
evidence, or claim-evidence pairs. These attacks can distort the truth, mislead
decision-makers, and ultimately undermine the reliability of FC models. Despite
growing research interest in adversarial attacks against AFC systems, a
comprehensive, holistic overview of key challenges remains lacking. These
challenges include understanding attack strategies, assessing the resilience of
current models, and identifying ways to enhance robustness. This survey
provides the first in-depth review of adversarial attacks targeting FC,
categorizing existing attack methodologies and evaluating their impact on AFC
systems. Additionally, we examine recent advancements in adversary-aware
defenses and highlight open research questions that require further
exploration. Our findings underscore the urgent need for resilient FC
frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial manipulations in pursuit of
preserving high verification accuracy.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Acquiescence bias, i.e. the tendency of humans to agree with statements in
surveys, independent of their actual beliefs, is well researched and
documented. Since Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be very
influenceable by relatively small changes in input and are trained on
human-generated data, it is reasonable to assume that they could show a similar
tendency. We present a study investigating the presence of acquiescence bias in
LLMs across different models, tasks, and languages (English, German, and
Polish). Our results indicate that, contrary to humans, LLMs display a bias
towards answering no, regardless of whether it indicates agreement or
disagreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人设提示技术如何影响LLM在社会群体表达中的语言抽象化程度，这是威望化的重要标志

Method: 基于语言期望偏见框架，分析六个开源LLM在三种提示条件下的输出，比较11个人设驱动响应与通用AI助手的差异，使用新建的Self-Stereo红板自我报告威望数据集

Result: 人设提示在调节语言抽象化方面效果有限，证实了人设作为社会人口群体代表的生态问题，甚至在体现边缘群体声音时也存在传播威望的风险

Conclusion: 人设提示技术并非调节LLM语言表达的有效方法，需要警惕该技术可能带来的威望化风险

Abstract: Persona-prompting is a growing strategy to steer LLMs toward simulating
particular perspectives or linguistic styles through the lens of a specified
identity. While this method is often used to personalize outputs, its impact on
how LLMs represent social groups remains underexplored. In this paper, we
investigate whether persona-prompting leads to different levels of linguistic
abstraction - an established marker of stereotyping - when generating short
texts linking socio-demographic categories with stereotypical or
non-stereotypical attributes. Drawing on the Linguistic Expectancy Bias
framework, we analyze outputs from six open-weight LLMs under three prompting
conditions, comparing 11 persona-driven responses to those of a generic AI
assistant. To support this analysis, we introduce Self-Stereo, a new dataset of
self-reported stereotypes from Reddit. We measure abstraction through three
metrics: concreteness, specificity, and negation. Our results highlight the
limits of persona-prompting in modulating abstraction in language, confirming
criticisms about the ecology of personas as representative of socio-demographic
groups and raising concerns about the risk of propagating stereotypes even when
seemingly evoking the voice of a marginalized group.

TL;DR: TrinityX是一个模块化对齐框架，通过混合校准专家(MoCaE)在Transformer架构中分别训练HHH三个维度的专家，使用任务自适应路由机制整合输出，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独优化对齐维度，导致权衡和不一致行为；MoE架构存在路由校准不佳的问题，限制了在对齐任务中的有效性。

Method: 提出TrinityX框架，包含分别训练的HHH维度专家，通过校准的任务自适应路由机制整合专家信号，形成统一的对齐感知表示。

Result: 在三个标准对齐基准测试中相对基线提升32.5%胜率、33.9%安全分数和28.4%真实性，同时减少40%以上内存使用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: TrinityX通过校准路由机制有效解决了LLM对齐中的维度权衡问题，具有良好的泛化性和效率优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range
of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness,
Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing
methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation,
leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing,
limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular
alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE)
within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained
experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated,
task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified,
alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard
alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and
TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines,
achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score,
and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and
inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation
studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model
evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言对齐方法存在两个问题：1）不所有英语响应都高质量，低质量英语参考会导致错误对齐；2）偏好数据构建方法存在偏见或经验主义问题

Method: 设计了一致性基础的数据选择方法CM-Align，包括一致性指导的英语参考选择和跨语言一致性基础的多语言偏好数据构建

Result: 在三个大语言模型和三个常见任务上的实验结果证明了方法的有效性和优势性

Conclusion: 高质量偏好数据的构建对多语言对齐至关重要

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) generally show a significant performance
gap in alignment between English and other languages. To bridge this gap,
existing research typically leverages the model's responses in English as a
reference to select the best/worst responses in other languages, which are then
used for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. However, we argue that
there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy
multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not
all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low
quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods
usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference
pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data
selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for
improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes
two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual
consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental
results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of
constructing high-quality preference data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学QA面临的挑战：需要精确解释从庞大、复杂且快速演化的专业知识库中提取信息，同时避免昂贵的微调成本

Method: 采用集成多个LLM变体（包括Anthropic和Google的模型）的零样本方法，结合RAG框架进行信息检索和答案生成

Result: 集成方法优于单个LLM，在某些情况下可与领域调优系统相媲美甚至超越，同时保持泛化能力；发现上下文长度与性能之间存在关系

Conclusion: 基于集成的零样本方法结合有效的RAG管道，为生物医学问答提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案，精确检索对于确保LLM在相关信息边界内操作至关重要

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) poses significant challenges due to the
need for precise interpretation of specialized knowledge drawn from a vast,
complex, and rapidly evolving corpus. In this work, we explore how large
language models (LLMs) can be used for information retrieval (IR), and an
ensemble of zero-shot models can accomplish state-of-the-art performance on a
domain-specific Yes/No QA task. Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge
tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases
rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability
and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method
aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic
and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our
investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance:
while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they
simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These
findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused
retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant
information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents. Our
results establish that ensemble-based zero-shot approaches, when paired with
effective RAG pipelines, constitute a practical and scalable alternative to
domain-tuned systems for biomedical question answering.

Motivation: 虽然LLMs在医学领域展现出巨大潜力，但关于它们对医学训练数据的记忆程度仍是一个关键未解问题，需要系统评估记忆现象的普遍性、特征、数量级和潜在影响。

Method: 系统分析了三种常见适应场景：医学语料库的持续预训练、标准医学基准的微调、以及真实世界临床数据（包括耶鲁纽黑文健康系统13,000+住院记录）的微调，全面评估记忆的普遍性、特征、数量和下游影响。

Result: 记忆在所有适应场景中普遍存在且显著高于通用领域报告水平。记忆可分为三类：有益（准确回忆临床指南和生物医学参考文献）、无信息（重复免责声明或模板化医疗文档语言）、有害（再生数据集特定或敏感临床内容）。

Conclusion: 记忆现象影响医学LLMs的开发和采用，需要促进有益记忆以增强领域特定推理和事实准确性，最小化无信息记忆以促进超越表面模式的深度学习，减轻有害记忆以防止敏感或可识别患者信息泄露。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
medicine. To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic
assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis.
However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical
training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of
memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it
occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is
memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect
medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios:
(1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard
medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including
over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The
results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation
scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain.
Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and
can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of
clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated
disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g.,
regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these
findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial
memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy,
minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond
surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the
leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.

Conclusion: 该方法能精确定位观点词并抵抗噪声，消融研究和可视化分析验证了其有效性

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify aspect terms and
determine their sentiment polarity. While dependency trees combined with
contextual semantics effectively identify aspect sentiment, existing methods
relying on syntax trees and aspect-aware attention struggle to model complex
semantic relationships. Their dependence on linear dot-product features fails
to capture nonlinear associations, allowing noisy similarity from irrelevant
words to obscure key opinion terms. Motivated by Differentiable Optimal
Matching, we propose the Optimal Transport Enhanced Syntactic-Semantic Graph
Network (OTESGN), which introduces a Syntactic-Semantic Collaborative
Attention. It comprises a Syntactic Graph-Aware Attention for mining latent
syntactic dependencies and modeling global syntactic topology, as well as a
Semantic Optimal Transport Attention designed to uncover fine-grained semantic
alignments amidst textual noise, thereby accurately capturing sentiment signals
obscured by irrelevant tokens. A Adaptive Attention Fusion module integrates
these heterogeneous features, and contrastive regularization further improves
robustness. Experiments demonstrate that OTESGN achieves state-of-the-art
results, outperforming previous best models by +1.01% F1 on Twitter and +1.30%
F1 on Laptop14 benchmarks. Ablative studies and visual analyses corroborate its
efficacy in precise localization of opinion words and noise resistance.

Motivation: 现有的M2S压缩方法依赖手动编写的模板，需要自动化方法来发现和优化更有效的单轮探测模板。

Method: 使用语言模型引导的进化框架，结合12个来源的智能采样和LLM-as-judge评估方法，设置成功阈值θ=0.70进行五代进化。

Result: 获得了5个进化世代、2个新模板家族，在GPT-4.1上达到44.8%总体成功率(103/230)。跨模型测试显示结构增益可迁移但存在模型差异。

Conclusion: 结构级搜索是获得更强单轮探测的可重复途径，强调了阈值校准和跨模型评估的重要性，发现提示长度与得分呈正相关。

Abstract: Multi-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) compresses iterative red-teaming into one
structured prompt, but prior work relied on a handful of manually written
templates. We present X-Teaming Evolutionary M2S, an automated framework that
discovers and optimizes M2S templates through language-model-guided evolution.
The system pairs smart sampling from 12 sources with an LLM-as-judge inspired
by StrongREJECT and records fully auditable logs.
  Maintaining selection pressure by setting the success threshold to $\theta =
0.70$, we obtain five evolutionary generations, two new template families, and
44.8% overall success (103/230) on GPT-4.1. A balanced cross-model panel of
2,500 trials (judge fixed) shows that structural gains transfer but vary by
target; two models score zero at the same threshold. We also find a positive
coupling between prompt length and score, motivating length-aware judging.
  Our results demonstrate that structure-level search is a reproducible route
to stronger single-turn probes and underscore the importance of threshold
calibration and cross-model evaluation. Code, configurations, and artifacts are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统序列到序列生成要么是离线方式（完整输入后才输出），要么需要学习复杂的流控制策略。DSM旨在提供更灵活、高效的流式多模态序列转换方案

Method: 使用仅解码器的语言模型，通过预处理步骤对时间对齐的流引入适当延迟，支持任意输入组合到任意输出的流式推理

Result: 在自动语音识别和文本到语音转换任务上达到state-of-the-art性能，支持任意长序列，延迟表现优秀，甚至可与离线基线竞争

Conclusion: DSM为多模态流式序列生成提供了统一且高效的解决方案，在保持低延迟的同时实现了优异的性能表现

Abstract: We introduce Delayed Streams Modeling (DSM), a flexible formulation for
streaming, multimodal sequence-to-sequence learning. Sequence-to-sequence
generation is often cast in an offline manner, where the model consumes the
complete input sequence before generating the first output timestep.
Alternatively, streaming sequence-to-sequence rely on learning a policy for
choosing when to advance on the input stream, or write to the output stream.
DSM instead models already time-aligned streams with a decoder-only language
model. By moving the alignment to a pre-processing step,and introducing
appropriate delays between streams, DSM provides streaming inference of
arbitrary output sequences, from any input combination, making it applicable to
many sequence-to-sequence problems. In particular, given text and audio
streams, automatic speech recognition (ASR) corresponds to the text stream
being delayed, while the opposite gives a text-to-speech (TTS) model. We
perform extensive experiments for these two major sequence-to-sequence tasks,
showing that DSM provides state-of-the-art performance and latency while
supporting arbitrary long sequences, being even competitive with offline
baselines. Code, samples and demos are available at

TL;DR: 研究发现不同自回归Transformer架构在事实回忆机制上存在显著差异，Qwen模型与GPT等模型不同，其注意力模块在早期层对事实回忆的贡献大于MLP模块


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer语言模型如何存储和检索事实关联对于提高可解释性和实现针对性模型编辑至关重要，但先前研究主要基于GPT风格模型，不清楚这些发现是否适用于不同自回归架构

Method: 对多个模型（包括GPT、LLaMA、Qwen和DeepSeek）进行事实回忆的全面评估，分析事实信息在何处以及如何被编码和访问

Result: 发现基于Qwen的模型表现出与先前模式不同的行为：最早层的注意力模块比MLP模块对事实回忆的贡献更大

Conclusion: 即使在自回归Transformer家族内部，架构变化也可能导致根本不同的事实回忆机制

Abstract: Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve
factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling
targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has
identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall.
However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different
autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA,
Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded
and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently
from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute
more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within
the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to
fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.

*Cheng Chen,Haiyan Yin,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的代理标注范式，通过学生模型与LLM教师协作评估标注质量，无需人工反馈。引入了CAI比率作为无监督评估指标，用于量化标注质量和模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态无监督环境中，评估LLM标注质量具有挑战性，传统方法失效且缺乏人工反馈。需要开发不依赖人工反馈的自动评估机制。

Method: 采用代理标注范式，学生模型与LLM教师协作，使用基于用户偏好的多数投票策略评估LLM输出一致性。提出CAI比率作为无监督评估指标。

Result: 在10个开放域NLP数据集和4个LLM上的实验表明，CAI比率与LLM准确率呈强正相关，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CAI比率是动态无监督环境中评估LLM标注质量和进行模型选择的重要工具，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have
significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators.
However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in
dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and
conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy
teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on
oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback
mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate
the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability
of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent
(CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only
quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user
preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the
identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to
ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a
strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential
tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MoVoC方法，通过整合监督形态分析到子词词汇中，为吉兹文字的低资源形态复杂语言开发了形态感知的分词器，在保持词汇意义的同时保护形态完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法往往无法保留形态边界，这在吉兹文字等低资源、形态复杂的语言中尤为明显，需要开发能够更好处理形态结构的分词方法。

Method: 提出MoVoC方法，结合基于语素和BPE的分词方式，构建混合分割方法。为四种吉兹文字语言整理并发布了手动标注的语素数据，并为其中两种语言构建了形态感知词汇表。

Result: 虽然在自动翻译质量上没有显著提升，但在内在指标MorphoScore和边界精度上观察到一致改进，证明了形态感知分词在增强语言保真度和分词效率方面的价值。

Conclusion: MoVoC方法有效提升了形态复杂语言的分词质量，发布的语素标注数据集和分词器将为低资源形态丰富语言的进一步研究提供支持。

Abstract: Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological
boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically
complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we
present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train
MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into
the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines
morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological
integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we
curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script
languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed
tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation
quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore,
and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation
in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated
datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research
in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are
available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC

Conclusion: 高质量的语言特定数据对多语言LLM发展至关重要，本研究方法可扩展到其他语言

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is deeply influenced by the
quality and composition of their training data. While much of the existing work
has centered on English, there remains a gap in understanding how to construct
effective training corpora for other languages. We explore scalable methods for
building web-based corpora for LLMs. We apply them to build a new 120B token
corpus in Portuguese that achieves competitive results to an industrial-grade
corpus. Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data
selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when
transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our
findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines,
including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to
the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the
importance of high-quality, language-specific data. While our case study
focuses on Portuguese, our methods are applicable to other languages, offering
insights for multilingual LLM development.

TL;DR: 这篇论文揭示了LLM漏洞攻击（LLM hacking）的风险，通过复现21项研究的37个数据标注任务，发现约1/3的偏差结论。高性能模型也无法完全避免这种风险，需要人工标注来减少误判。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和量化大语言模型在社会科学研究中应用时存在的系统性偏差和随机错误风险，这些问题可能导致类型I、类型II等统计错误。

Method: 复现21项已发表的社会科学研究中的37个数据标注任务，使用18个不同的LLM模型，分析2,361个实际假设，分析13百万个LLM标签。

Result: 约1/3的偏差结论出现在最先进模型中，小模型中这一比例达到一半。效果量越大，风险越低。人工标注能有效减少偏差，但常见的回归校正技术效果有限。

Conclusion: LLM漏洞攻击是社会科学研究中的重要风险，需要更严格的验证流程和人工标注来减少错误。故意攻击极其容易，任何结果都可被撰改为显著性结果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research
by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and
text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the
implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting
strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic
biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type
I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.
  We quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks
from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models.
Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure
how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find
incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three
hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small
language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and
better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate
models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as
effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of
findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking
mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in
reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly,
common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in
reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.
  Beyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is
unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases,
anything can be presented as statistically significant.

Abstract: In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for
reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success
in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing
complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has
emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the
rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces
foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in
algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely
to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore
strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence
(ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for
reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including
foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream
applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly
evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for
broader reasoning models. Github:

Method: 建立了精确的定义，引入了结构化分类法（包括基于视频的VideoGen、基于占据的OccGen和基于LiDAR的LiDARGen方法），系统总结了适用于3D/4D设置的数据集和评估指标。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在层次细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：1）分层跨模态门控注意力机制；2）异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块；3）级联卷积变换器特征细化技术。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过创新的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，解决了传统方法的局限性，在洪水检测性能上实现了显著提升。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

Motivation: 视频大语言模型在处理更多输入帧以捕获细粒度时间细节时，会面临计算成本过高和长上下文性能下降的问题

Method: 运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验表明，VPS 在 Video-MME 和 EventHallusion 等基准测试中持续显著提升性能

Conclusion: VPS 提供了一种内存高效且鲁棒的框架，可增强视频大语言模型的时间推理能力，比其他并行替代方案更具扩展优势

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

TL;DR: 提出APML损失函数，通过可微分的Sinkhorn迭代实现点云预测中的一对一匹配，解决了传统损失函数的多对一对应问题，在保持接近二次时间复杂度的情况下获得更好的空间分布和收敛性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致密集区域点拥塞和稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作；EMD虽然能强制一对一对应但计算复杂度太高。

Method: 使用温度缩放相似度矩阵的Sinkhorn迭代实现完全可微分的一对一匹配近似，通过分析计算温度值保证最小分配概率，无需手动调参。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或更好的定量性能。

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种高效可微分的一对一匹配解决方案，在点云预测任务中表现出优越性能，且计算复杂度与Chamfer-based损失相当。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Result: 在ISTD数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在性能、轻量性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: L-RPCANet成功实现了参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性的平衡，为红外小目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

TL;DR: 本文提出超稀疏采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低数码相机的能耗来实现高速视频的压缩成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数码相机在高分辨率和高帧率下能耗过高，压缩成像技术可以大幅降低能耗，但现有的随机采样策略在动态范围和实现复杂度上有限制。

Method: 提出USS策略，在每个空间位置只设置一个子帧为1，其他为0，并构建BSTFormer模型，结合局部坐标注意力、全局稀疏注意力和时间注意力来处理采样数据。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上，方法显著超越了以往的最先进算法，并具有更高的动态范围和固定曝光时间的优势。

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片级高速视频压缩成像系统的良好选择，能够在大幅节省能耗的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命犯罪检测的数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案，数据集和生成框架已开源

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决ViT架构预训练于三通道自然图像与单通道医学图像不兼容的问题，避免信息损失

Method: 采用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容的三通道格式

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学图像任务中充分发挥表征能力，具有实际临床部署潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉AD引起的脑部不对称病理特征，提高诊断性能并具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Motivation: 传统帧式相机在长曝光时会产生明显的视觉模糊和帧间信息丢失，严重降低视频质量。事件相机具有高时间分辨率，可以用于缓解运动模糊和实现中间帧预测。

Method: 提出了Learnable Double Integral (LDI)网络来估计参考帧与清晰潜在图像之间的映射关系；引入基于学习的除法重建模块来优化结果和训练效率；设计了自适应无参数融合策略来利用LDI输出的置信度；构建了自监督学习框架，利用模糊帧、潜在图像和事件流之间的相互约束进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视频去模糊和插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。使用DAVIS346c相机构建了包含真实模糊图像和事件的数据集，证明了方法在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EVDI++是一个有效的统一框架，能够利用事件相机的高时间分辨率来解决视频去模糊和插值问题，在真实和合成场景中都表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕获内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的方法来充分利用高光谱数据的丰富信息

Method: 提出HyMamba网络，包含光谱状态集成(SSI)模块和高光谱Mamba(HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描SSM同步学习空间和光谱信息

Result: 在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数，在7个基准数据集上实现state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一的光谱、跨深度和时间建模，有效解决了现有高光谱跟踪器的局限性，展现出卓越的跟踪性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在处理需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题时，会依赖训练时的固有偏见而忽视视觉证据，导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现VLMs在处理需要关注图像特定细节的精确问题时表现不佳，往往依赖训练偏见而非视觉证据，需要系统分析导致这种性能差异的因素。

Method: 建立多维检测框架，系统分析输入数据特征（图像和提示词）对性能的影响，使用开源VLMs研究注意力值随输入参数（图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）的变化。

Result: 即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小修改，也会导致VLM答案生成方式和整体性能的巨大变化。

Conclusion: 需要深入理解VLMs行为变化机制，并开发表征这些变化的方法，以提高模型在处理精确视觉问题时的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过拟合问题，通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1) 伪真实标签要么只覆盖区分性部位要么无法区分相邻的同类实例；2) WSDDN基础网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义差距大；3) 优化过程中忽略被忽略的建议框导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：1) 热力图导向的建议框选择算法(HGPS)，利用双阈值预选建议框；2) 弱监督基础检测网络(WSBDN)，为每个建议框添加背景类表征并使用热力图进行预监督；3) 在被忽略建议框上引入负确定性监督损失。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上分别达到了58.5%/81.8%和55.6%/80.5%的mAP/mCorLoc分数，表现超过了当前最先进的弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过HGPS算法、WSBDN网络和负确定性监督损失，有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的关键挑战，实现了独创性的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用效率增益

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a
crucial component for autonomous driving and smart transportation. However, in
the process of basic feature extraction, perspective transformation, and
feature fusion, noise and error will gradually accumulate. To address this
issue, we propose InsFusion, which can extract proposals from both raw and
fused features and utilizes these proposals to query the raw features, thereby
mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Conclusion: 提出了一种自监督解耦视频表征学习的新视角，对视频分析和生成领域做出了贡献

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Conclusion: 通过因果损失实现端到端监督，使整个流水线可微分，统一了学习过程，使先前不可训练的组件完全可学习

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Motivation: 现实交通监控中，车辆图像常因恶劣天气、光照不足或高速运动而出现严重噪声和模糊，导致车牌识别准确率下降，特别是当车牌在图像中占比较小时

Method: 采用垂直残差自编码器架构，通过辅助块在每个编码阶段注入输入感知特征来指导表示学习过程，比传统自编码器能更好地保持全局信息

Result: 在车牌可见的车辆图像数据集上，VRAE consistently优于AE、GAN和Flow-Based方法。相比同深度AE，PSNR提升约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提升1%，参数仅增加约1%

Conclusion: VRAE架构能有效增强交通监控中的退化图像，在保持实时性的同时显著提升图像质量，为车牌识别系统提供了有效的预处理解决方案

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

TL;DR: SCFusion是一个多视图多目标跟踪框架，通过稀疏变换、密度感知加权和多视图一致性损失来解决BEV投影中的特征失真和非均匀密度问题，在WildTrack和MultiviewX数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图多目标跟踪在跨摄像头保持目标身份一致性方面面临挑战，传统BEV投影方法存在特征失真和非均匀密度问题，影响检测和跟踪精度。

Method: 提出SCFusion框架，包含三个技术：1）稀疏变换避免投影中的不自然插值；2）密度感知加权基于空间置信度和相机距离自适应融合特征；3）多视图一致性损失促使各相机在融合前学习判别性特征。

Result: 在WildTrack数据集上达到95.9%的IDF1分数，在MultiviewX数据集上达到89.2%的MODP分数，优于基准方法TrackTacular。

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的局限性，为多视图目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在三个视频数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用日益广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏因果洞察等问题，且当前反事实解释方法通常未结合目标模型指导，降低了语义保真度和实用性。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，降低了生成解释的计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同的视频数据集（EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k、Something-Something V2）上，LD-ViCE优于现有最先进方法，R2分数提升高达68%，同时推理时间减少一半。定性分析证实其生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要一步，能够为目标模型行为提供有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集、光谱-空间Transformer分类器和轻量级测试时自适应策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建多退化高光谱数据集模拟9种代表性退化类型；2) 设计光谱-空间Transformer分类器(SSTC)结合多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；3) 提出置信度感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)进行轻量级测试时自适应。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，HyperTTA在多种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA提供了一个统一的框架，能够在不访问源数据或目标标注的情况下，实现高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒和动态自适应。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

Conclusion: SBDM为探索直觉发育的假设场景提供了一个新的框架，在直觉皮层厚度预测方面取得了显著成效。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

Conclusion: 通过改进SSM模块的计算过程，可以有效提升轻量级超分辨率模型的性能，为SSM在计算机视觉领域的应用提供了新的思路

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 多视图方法能够有效提升对比自盛学习在不平衡数据集上的表现，通过相互信息理论支撑和特征过滤机制，能够更好地提取尾部类别的代表性特征。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Conclusion: 海底物体检测面临多重挑战，需要综合性解决方案。大型视觉-语言模型为解决这些问题提供了新的方向，但需要进一步研究优化技术和提高合成数据质量来实现实时应用。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Conclusion: HuMo成功解决了多模态人类视频生成的协调问题，通过创新的训练策略和引导机制实现了高质量的多模态控制视频生成。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

TL;DR: MESH是一个新的基准测试，用于系统评估大型视频模型(LVMs)中的幻觉问题，采用问答框架和自下而上的方法，与人类视频理解过程对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频幻觉基准测试过度依赖人工分类，忽略了人类自然解释视频的感知过程，需要更系统化的评估方法。

Method: 使用问答框架（二元和多选题），包含目标和陷阱实例，采用自下而上的方法评估基本对象、粗到细的主题特征以及主题-动作对。

Result: 评估显示LVMs在识别基本对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主题的多个动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加。

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，特别是在长视频中处理复杂动作和细节时能够更好地评估模型性能。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型作为评估工具存在偏见、过度自信和在不同图像领域表现不一致的问题，标准集成方法在TTI任务中效果不佳

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB)，结合贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类，根据样本视觉特征动态分配提示权重

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench基准测试中，MMB在配对偏好判断准确性、与人工标注对齐度和校准方面优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 多模态特定策略对评估模型校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模TTI评估提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Motivation: 传统的单视角分类或回归模型无法充分捕捉植物表型特征分析所需的所有信息，影响植物健康评估和收获成熟度预测的准确性。

Method: 采用多视角数据集，通过随机选择24个视角（选择向量）学习视角不变嵌入表示，并尝试了跨5个高度级别的随机视角选择（共120个视角，选择矩阵）。

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在ACM Multimedia 2025的Growth Modelling挑战赛中赢得了植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两项任务的第一名。

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升植物表型特征分析的准确性，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Motivation: 多模态模型在自然图像分割中表现优异，但在医学领域表现不佳，主要原因是文本提示与医学视觉特征之间的语义鸿沟以及由此导致的特征分散问题

Method: 提出期望最大化(EM)聚合机制来动态聚类特征到紧凑语义中心以减少特征分散，同时设计文本引导像素解码器利用领域不变的文本知识来指导深度视觉表示

Conclusion: 通过语义聚合视角解决医学图像分割中的多模态融合挑战，EM聚合和文本引导解码器的协同作用显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Motivation: 格陵兰冰盖下床地形的准确测绘对海平面预测至关重要，但雷达观测数据稀疏且分布不均，需要开发新方法来处理这种数据稀缺和不确定性问题

Method: 构建基于地表观测数据（高程、速度、质量平衡）的空间图，添加梯度特征和多项式趋势来捕捉局部变异和宏观结构。采用混合损失函数结合置信度加权的雷达监督和动态平衡正则化，使用蒙特卡洛dropout显式建模不确定性

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性，支持气候预测和政策制定

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive

knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且多功能的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

*Sara Behnamian,Rasoul Khaksarinezhad,Andreas Langer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FractalPINN-Flow是一个无监督深度学习框架，通过分形变形网络直接从连续灰度帧学习光流估计，无需真实标签，结合变分公式和TV正则化实现准确平滑的光流场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注成本高昂。本文旨在开发无监督学习框架，直接从连续帧中学习光流，解决高分辨率数据和标注有限场景下的挑战。

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，基于分形几何和自相似性设计递归编码器-解码器结构，结合跳跃连接捕获细节和长程运动模式。训练目标使用变分公式，包含L1/L2数据保真项和TV正则化项。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够产生准确、平滑且边缘保持的光流场，特别在高分辨率数据和标注有限场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow成功实现了无监督光流估计，分形网络结构和变分正则化的结合有效提升了光流估计性能，为实际应用提供了可行的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved
coastal water segmentation. Our approach integrates five synergistic
components: HSV-guided color supervision, gradient-based coastline
optimization, morphological post-processing, sea area cleanup, and connectivity
control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational
efficiency. For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth
estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By
analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,

Conclusion: BcQLM提供了一条在实际硬件约束下可部署MLLM的有前景路径，具有模块化和可扩展设计，能够渐进式扩展到更广泛的多模态任务

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Motivation: 现有密度图定义通常依赖于头部位置或基于目标的空间统计信息，需要扩展这些定义以包含单个边界框维度信息，从而在拥挤场景中改进检测效果

Method: 提出CQ模块预测目标密度图并嵌入密度信息到解码器中，使用密度引导的查询来改进拥挤场景检测。该方法可集成到通用2D和3D transformer检测器中(CQ2D和CQ3D架构)

Result: 在STCrowd数据集上相比基础模型有显著性能提升，优于大多数最先进方法。在CrowdHuman数据集上集成到最先进检测器后可进一步提升性能

Conclusion: CQ是首个有效桥接2D和3D拥挤环境检测的方法，具有通用性且不需要额外数据，代码已开源

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

TL;DR: ArgoTweak是首个提供真实地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据三元组的公开数据集，解决了现有方法依赖合成先验导致的sim2real差距问题，通过双射映射框架实现细粒度地图元素级修改，显著提升了高精地图的自验证和自更新能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法必须依赖合成先验，造成不一致性和显著的sim2real差距，需要真实的地图先验数据来支持可靠的高精地图自验证和自更新。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模地图修改分解为地图元素级别的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，同时保持未变化元素的高保真度。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，广泛的消融实验进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的重要性。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak通过建立可解释的先验辅助高精地图基准，推动了可扩展、自改进的地图解决方案发展，为可靠的地图先验集成提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Conclusion: 事件相机在星迹踪定向中具有重要价值，通过创新的真实值验证方法证明了其高精度性能，为低成本低延迟定向系统提供了可靠的技术基础

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像的强缩放等挑战性情况下容易产生错误匹配。

Method: 采用波束搜索策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建BEAMER架构来学习和传播多假设。

Result: BEAMER相比最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 预测和传播多个对应假设的方法能够有效提升密集图像匹配的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在挑战性场景中。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale

artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在架构限制、模态约束以及与视觉语言模型不对齐的问题，同时RLHF优化过程中存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了有效的规模化。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表明生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像，从而内在对齐奖励目标与VLM架构。

Result: RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间表现出高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模型规模扩展和上下文扩展两个维度实现规模化，有效缓解了小模型中普遍存在的模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成奖励建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作资源消耗大等限制，需要优化数据采集效率。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预先仪器数据来智能地重新配置主仪器。

Method: 提出了两种学习方法：强化学习和模仿学习。这些方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标指向应用中显示出明显优势，能够显著提高科学数据的采集效率和质量。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试中，使用18个跨领域仓库，EnvX达到74.07%执行完成率和51.85%任务通过率，优于现有框架。

Conclusion: EnvX将仓库从被动代码资源转变为智能交互代理，促进了开源生态系统的可访问性和协作能力，代表了软件重用方式的重大转变。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

TL;DR: 基于大型AI模型的教师-学生机制的任务特定信任语义揉取模型，通过服务器端提取信任语义并传递给设备端，实现高效准确的协作设备选择。

Motivation: 解决任务所有者独立评估所有协作者信任度时带来的频繁数据交换、复杂推理和动态环境变化导致的明显开销和信任评估性能下降问题。

Method: 采用LAM驱动的教师-学生机器人架构，在服务器端部署具有增强存储模块的教师机器人进行多维信任数据收集和任务特定信任语义揆取，然后向设备端学生机器人传递信任语义信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，2TSD模型能够减少协作者评估时间、降低设备资源消耗并提高协作者选择的准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型通过中央化的信任语义揆取和分布式传递，有效解决了分布式信任评估中的性能问题，为复杂计算任务的高效执行提供了可靠的协作设备选择方案。

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Motivation: 解决具身智能体在动态非平稳环境中持续执行指令的挑战，增强LLM的环境推理能力并建立环境上下文记忆

Method: 提出探索检索增强规划框架，将指令分解为环境上下文查询和任务执行，集成信息探索到LLM规划过程，并使用时序一致性精化处理知识衰减

Conclusion: ExRAP框架有效平衡环境探索负载和记忆有效性，显著提升动态环境中持续指令跟随任务的性能

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency
refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of
knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and
CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied
instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and
types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other
state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal
success rate and execution efficiency.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Conclusion: TCPO方法展示了将偏好学习技术与思维链过程结合的巨大潜力，能够有效提升视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

Motivation: 解决LLM作为评判者时的监督问题，避免在不知道真实情况下必须无限监控的困境

Method: 通过观察不同LLM评判者在评分其他LLM时的一致性和分歧，将逻辑一致性形式化为整数响应计数空间中的线性规划问题

Result: 发展了无知识警报器，可以在没有假阻性的情况下检测出至少一个或多个评判者违反用户指定的评分能力要求

Conclusion: 通过利用LLM评判者之间的逻辑一致性，可以在不依赖外部真实情况的前提下有效监测并告警错误评判

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为构建更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 这个初步实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基于决策以及探索AI系统中优化基于学习和符号推理之间的潜在交互作用提供了基础

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

Motivation: 现有不可学习样本方法在跨任务场景中失效，无法真正保护数据所有者的利益，需要深入理解不可学习性的本质并开发有效的评估指标。

Method: 通过观察干净模型和中毒模型的收敛过程差异，分析损失景观特征，提出Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL)来量化参数不可学习性，并基于此提出Unlearnable Distance (UD)来评估数据不可学习性。

Result: 发现现有不可学习方法在多任务数据集Taskonomy上失效，损失景观分析揭示了不可学习性的内在机制，提出的UD指标能够有效评估不同方法的不可学习能力边界。

Conclusion: 现有不可学习方法距离真正的不可学习样本还有差距，需要基于损失景观和优化路径的深入理解来开发更有效的保护方法，UD指标为社区提供了评估不可学习性的新工具。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and
dramatically facilitating their daily work.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

Motivation: 联邦学习分布式特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，现有防御方法在面对自适应攻击者时表现不足，需要更强大的防御机制。

Method: 首先设计了一种新的自适应攻击者，能够在少量恶意客户端情况下突破现有防御；然后提出了Hammer and Anvil防御框架，结合两种正交防御原理，通过参数优化形成组合防御Krum+。

Result: 新自适应攻击只需1-2个恶意客户端（共20个）就能攻破现有最先进防御；Krum+组合防御成功抵御了新自适应攻击和现有最先进攻击。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了现有联邦学习防御在面对强大自适应攻击时的脆弱性，同时提出了有效的组合防御方案Krum+，为联邦学习安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Motivation: 基于AI的心电图分析受限于标注数据稀缺，自监督学习可以利用大规模未标注数据，但现有方法缺乏对ECG生理特性的考虑。

Method: 提出PhysioCLR框架：1）整合ECG生理相似性线索到对比学习中；2）设计ECG特异性增强技术保持类别不变；3）采用混合损失函数优化表示质量。

Conclusion: 通过将生理知识嵌入对比学习，PhysioCLR能够学习具有临床意义且可迁移的ECG特征，为更有效和标签高效的心电图诊断提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Motivation: 扩展传统Transformer架构，通过可信度机制和上下文学习来提高模型的学习能力和预测性能，特别是处理训练时未见过的新类别特征。

Method: 在Credibility Transformer基础上增加上下文学习机制，使用包含相似实例的上下文批次来增强CLS token表示，通过额外的上下文信息和微调来改进模型。

Result: 实证验证表明，上下文学习通过适应相似风险模式提高了预测准确性，并且能够泛化到训练时未见过的新实例。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文学习机制有效增强了Credibility Transformer的性能，使其能够处理新的类别特征，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based
interface, LLM-powered explanations, interactive Pareto exploration for model
selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing
fairness tools. Demo walkthrough available at: https://youtu.be/_rcpjlXFqkw.

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Conclusion: MARLINE能够有效处理非平稳环境中的概念漂移问题，即使源域和目标域概念不匹配也能成功利用多源知识，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

Motivation: EEG中的各种人工故障（肌肉、眼球运动、电极等）影响自动分析的准确性，但大规模标注成本高，需要通过生成模型来生成真实的故障数据段。

Method: 使用TUH EEG Artifact语料库，比较条件WGAN-GP模型和1D去噪渡洱模型。进行三方面评估：保真度（频谱、协方差、自相关等）、特异性（类别恢复能力）和实用性（数据增帆效果）。

Result: WGAN-GP在频谱对齐和MMD指标上表现更好，但两种模型的条件恢复能力都较弱，限制了数据增帆的立即效果。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG故障生成建立了基准流程，显示了现有模型在条件控制方面的不足，为未来改进条件化生成模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

Motivation: 传统降阶模型在求解参数化偏微分方程族时，长时间尺度预测精度会下降，需要新的方法来提升长期预测能力

Method: 1) 引入灵活、高阶且计算成本低的有限差分格式；2) 提出Rollout损失函数来训练降阶模型，使其能够在任意时间尺度上做出准确预测

Result: 在2D Burgers方程上验证了所提方法的有效性，证明了该方法能够显著提升降阶模型的长期预测精度

Conclusion: 通过结合新型有限差分格式和Rollout损失函数，成功解决了降阶模型在长时间预测中的精度退化问题，为复杂偏微分方程的高效求解提供了新思路

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

### [125] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)，将梯度压缩和差分隐私机制结合，通过联合分析提供更强的隐私保护，在相同噪声预算下隐私级别与压缩维度平方根成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私保护是两个关键问题。现有研究孤立分析梯度压缩和高斯机制的隐私效果，无法充分利用两者的协同效应。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合梯度压缩和高斯机制，使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，并应用于带梯度下降或自适应优化器的联邦学习。

Result: 理论证明SGM的隐私级别与压缩维度平方根成反比，实验表明在相同隐私级别下，SGM至少与非压缩私有FL方法相当，在某些设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: SGM通过联合分析压缩和隐私机制，在保持通信效率的同时提供更强的隐私保护，自适应优化器进一步提升了实证性能。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重症监护数据集如MIMIC和eICU在规模和多样性上有限，无法支持跨机构通用预测模型和健康公平性研究。CRITICAL数据集的大规模多机构特性带来了数据协调的复杂性，需要专门的预处理解决方案。

Method: CRISP系统通过四个核心步骤处理数据：(1)透明的数据质量管理与审计追踪，(2)跨词汇映射将异构医学术语统一到SNOMED-CT标准，(3)模块化架构支持并行优化和快速处理，(4)提供全面的基线模型基准测试。

Conclusion: CRISP系统成功解决了多机构重症监护数据协调的复杂性，为研究者提供了高效的数据预处理工具，促进了大尺度多机构临床AI研究的发展，特别是在健康公平性研究方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

Motivation: 大语言模型在微调时遇到坏忘问题，需要一种无需改变训练过程或模型结构的方法来平衡下游任务性能和坏忘

Method: 使用任务向量（微调后参数减去预训练参数）与预训练参数的比值作为剪枝指标，量化坏忘程度并集成到剪枝策略中

Result: 在8个数据集上进行实验，坏忘率仅为0.25%，下游任务准确率保持99.67%

Conclusion: FAPM方法能够在不需要辅助数据或改变训练过程的情况下，有效控制大语言模型的坏忘问题，保持高性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

Conclusion: FoQuS方法能有效近似全数据集训练效果，大幅降低训练开销，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of

\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互，导致泛化性能下降

Method: 将缓存分配重新表述为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能

Result: 在11个任务上优于所有基线方法，在GSM8K上比启发式基线提升7个百分点，代码补全任务仅用1.5%原始预算就超越完整KV缓存性能

Conclusion: 学习式压缩策略在KV缓存预算分配方面具有巨大潜力，EvolKV展示了在内存效率和任务性能之间的有效权衡

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速方法如奖励塑造和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定。

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）作为导师为RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）提供指导，并在Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four等环境中测试，包含54种配置实验。

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛，同时保持可比的最优性能。建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间，但会导致收敛动态不太稳定。

Conclusion: LLM指导能有效改善强化学习收敛，但其效果对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

Result: 节省约50% GPU成本，推理延迟降低37.51%-65.73%

Conclusion: MoEpic系统通过创新的专家分割和智能缓存管理，有效解决了MoE模型推理时的内存瓶颈问题

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比基线方法获得更低后悔值和更稳定的训练，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下也能良好工作

Conclusion: 提出的梯度扰动方法成功结合了PFL和DFL的优势，提供了理论收敛保证，在实际应用中表现出色

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在处理类别不平衡和域偏移问题时效果有限，需要重新思考从复杂聚合方法转向改进特征提取器本身

Method: 使用冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，替代传统的FFREEDA骨干网络，无需大量参数调优

Result: 实验结果表明VFM能有效缓解域间隙、类别不平衡和非独立同分布问题，显著提高整体准确率

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器而非复杂的适应或联邦学习方法，是现实世界联邦学习成功的关键

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Motivation: 解决同态加密环境下神经网络文本生成中argmax和采样等非多项式运算的计算效率瓶颈问题

Method: 开发了HE友好的cutmax算法用于贪婪解码，以及首个HE兼容的top-p采样方法，两者都是多项式运算且可微分

Result: 在真实LLM输出上实现了24-35倍的延迟降低，提供了理论收敛保证和隐私保护证明

Conclusion: 这些技术为隐私保护的文本生成提供了实用的多项式替代方案，显著推进了安全文本生成的发展

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MoT（Mixture-of-Tinkers）方法来解决图基础模型中的领域泛化冲突问题，通过信息调整器和正则化调整器来改善信息容量和梯度监督，在多个领域和任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基础模型在处理多领域图数据时面临领域泛化冲突问题，具体表现为模型退化（编码器和码本无法捕捉输入多样性）和表示坍塌（隐藏嵌入和码本向量无法保持语义可分性），这些问题源于信息瓶颈和正则化缺失。

Method: 提出MoT框架，包含：(1)信息调整器-使用边缘语义融合策略和基于领域感知路由的混合码本来提升信息容量；(2)正则化调整器-使用两个额外的正则化来改进梯度监督。该方法遵循GFM的缩放定律，提供可控的模型规模。

Result: 在6个领域的22个数据集上的实验表明，MoT在有监督、少样本和零样本场景下相比SOTA基线都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: MoT通过解决图基础模型中的信息瓶颈和正则化缺失问题，有效提升了模型在多领域图数据上的泛化能力，为图基础模型的优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 随着模型训练数据需求增长超过网络数据索引速度，未来十年将面临数据枯竭问题，而用户生成内容虽多但存在隐私泄露和不良内容风险

Method: 使用预训练生成模型，通过条件生成方式为每个真实数据样本生成合成数据，实现数据集匿名化和去毒化

Result: GDR在数据集匿名化方面优于工业级解决方案，能够直接对高度不安全数据集进行去毒化，且生成数据自然匹配网络规模数据集的多样性

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩展前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Conclusion: SHAining方法能够系统评估事件日志特征对流程挖掘算法性能的影响，为算法选择和鲁棒性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏假设单一最优教师，但实际上不同学生有不同最佳教师，同一学生在不同数据集上的最佳教师也不同。需要解决多教师监督冲突问题，统一多个教师的推理能力。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Conclusion: 对于这个心脏病预测任务，RMSProp是最有效的优化器，因为它在关键指标上提供了平衡的性能。研究建议在计算资源不受限的环境下，通过详细的性能评估来选择优化器，以提升深度学习模型训练的科学性和性能。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文主张将可解释性特别是机制性方法作为AI对齐的核心设计原则，而非辅助诊断工具，认为这是实现安全可信AI的关键路径


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型神经模型在高风险场景部署时存在与人类价值观对齐的可靠性问题，需要内部透明性来确保系统行为符合人类意图

Method: 对比事后解释方法（如LIME、SHAP）和机制性技术（如电路追踪、激活修补），强调后者能提供对内部故障的因果洞察

Result: 机制性可解释性方法能够揭示行为方法（如RLHF、红队测试）可能忽略的欺骗性或未对齐推理模式

Conclusion: AI安全和可信赖的进展依赖于将可解释性作为AI研发的一等目标，确保系统不仅有效而且可审计、透明且与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

### [152] [Classification of 24-hour movement behaviors from wrist-worn accelerometer data: from handcrafted features to deep learning techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08606)
*Alireza Sameh,Mehrdad Rostami,Mourad Oussalah,Vahid Farrahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习算法使用原始加速度信号在24小时运动行为分类中表现略好于传统机器学习算法，准确度约85%左右


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在分类24小时运动行为（睡眠、坐着、轻度和中高强度运动）方面的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腕加速计数据，采用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN四种深度学习算法和六种传统机器学习算法，分别使用原始信号和手工特征进行训练和测试

Result: 深度学习算法使用原始信号时准确度达85%（LSTM/BiLSTM/GRU）和80%（1D-CNN），而使用手工特征时所有算法准确度在70-81%范围内，中高强度运动分类错误较多

Conclusion: 深度学习方法使用原始加速度信号在预测24小时运动行为强度方面仅略好于使用手工特征的深度学习和传统机器学习算法

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

TL;DR: XNNTab是一个可解释的神经网络架构，使用稀疏自编码器学习字典特征，为表格数据预测提供语义解释，性能与最先进的黑盒模型相当


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在金融和医疗等领域应用广泛，但现有的DNN模型虽然预测性能好，但缺乏可解释性，是黑盒模型

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)在学习字典中学习单语义特征，通过自动化方法为这些特征分配人类可解释的语义，将预测表示为语义有意义组件的线性组合

Conclusion: XNNTab成功解决了表格数据预测中性能与可解释性的平衡问题，为关键应用领域提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

### [154] [An upper bound of the silhouette validation metric for clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08625)
*Hugo Sträng,Tai Dinh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对特定数据集计算轮廓系数上限的新方法，通过为每个数据点推导尖锐的上界，并聚合得到平均轮廓宽度(ASW)的数据依赖上界，该上界通常远低于1，可用于评估聚类质量接近最优解的程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓系数是评估聚类质量的常用内部指标，但数据集特定的ASW最大值通常是未知的，标准上限1往往无法达到，需要一种方法来量化聚类结果与最优解的接近程度。

Method: 为给定数据集中的每个数据点推导其轮廓宽度的尖锐上界，然后通过聚合这些个体上界得到ASW的规范数据依赖上界。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，所提出的上界在许多情况下被证明是接近紧致的，显著丰富了聚类质量评估的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示单个数据点是否能够被良好放置，支持基于轮廓系数的优化循环的早期停止，并帮助回答关键问题：在当前特定数据上，聚类结果距离最佳可能结果有多近。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

Motivation: 机器学习实验结果的复现性一直是个挑战，特别是在强化学习领域，算法在实践中往往不稳定。虽然表格强化学习已有可复制算法，但如何扩展到更实用的函数逼近设置仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 首先开发了两个高效的可复制随机设计回归和未中心化协方差估计算法，然后利用这些工具为线性MDP提供了首个可证明高效的可复制RL算法，包括生成模型和情景设置。

Result: 成功开发了可复制的线性函数逼近RL方法，并在实验中验证了算法效果，展示了如何激发更一致的神经策略。

Conclusion: 这项工作在可复制强化学习方面取得了重要进展，为线性函数逼近设置提供了首个可证明高效的可复制算法，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

TL;DR: 开发了诊断信号保真度指数(SFI)来量化痴呆症患者层面的数据质量，并通过SFI感知校准显著提高了机器学习模型在不同医疗系统中的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录训练的机器学习模型在不同医疗系统间性能下降，主要原因是诊断信号衰减——不同机构间诊断质量和一致性的差异影响了训练和预测所用编码的可靠性

Method: 构建模拟框架生成2500个合成数据集，SFI包含六个可解释组件：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和轨迹稳定性。应用乘法调整的SFI感知校准方法

Result: 在最优参数下，SFI感知校准显著改善了所有指标(p<0.001)，平衡准确率提升10.3%，召回率提升32.5%，精确率提升31.9%，F1分数提升26.1%

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型泛化的可解决障碍，SFI感知校准提供了一种无需标签的实用策略，可增强跨医疗环境的预测性能

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Motivation: 联邦学习中通过安全多方计算进行安全聚合可以保护敏感数据隐私，但实数值数据无法实现完美隐私，而有限域方法又存在精度复杂度交换问题。

Method: 提出使用君土而非有限域的安全参数聚合方法，利用君土上的均匀分布来保证完美隐私，避免精度损失。

Conclusion: 基于君土的安全聚合协议为联邦学习提供了一种更安全的选择，能够同时实现完美隐私和高精度的模型训练。

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Motivation: 解决Backpropagation算法的生物不合理性（反向锁定和全局误差传播）以及Forward-Forward算法准确率低和推理效率差的问题。

Method: 将Forward-Forward算法与基于相似性的Tuplet损失函数框架相结合，提出FAUST算法，消除了推理时需要多个前向传播的问题。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，FAUST显著提高了准确率，在CIFAR-10上达到56.22%的准确率，接近Backpropagation的57.63%基准。

Conclusion: FAUST算法成功解决了Forward-Forward算法的准确率和效率问题，在保持生物合理性的同时大幅缩小了与Backpropagation的性能差距。

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

Abstract: In the evolving IT landscape, stability and reliability of systems are
essential, yet their growing complexity challenges DevOps teams in
implementation and maintenance. Log analysis, a core element of AIOps, provides
critical insights into complex behaviors and failures. This dissertation
introduces a three-layered architecture to support DevOps in failure
resolution. The first layer, Log Investigation, performs autonomous log
labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DP-FTRL方法假设服务器是半诚实的，并未解决在实际环境中客户端可能失踪或被突破的问题。直接使用TEE可能导致分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 设计了一个作为信任计算基础的服务器扩展，通过短暂TEE模块生成服务器操作的可验证证明，并由选中的客户端进行审计。

Result: 形式化证明了在恶意环境下的隐私保证，实验结果显示在多个实际场景下对客户端仅添加小常数开销。

Conclusion: 该方案有效解决了差分隐私FTRL在恶意安全环境下的挑战，在保持系统性能的同时提供了强化的安全保证。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through

the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2

TL;DR: SAPO是一种完全去中心化的异步RL后训练算法，专为异构计算节点网络设计，解决了传统RL训练中的并行化瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要大规模并行化推理，带来延迟、内存、可靠性等技术挑战和高昂成本，需要一种去中心化的解决方案

Method: SAPO算法在异构计算节点网络中运行，每个节点管理自己的策略模型，通过网络"共享"rollouts，无需假设延迟、模型同质性或硬件要求

Result: 在受控实验中SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益，并在数千个节点的开源演示网络中成功测试

Conclusion: SAPO有效解决了RL后训练的扩展瓶颈，支持异构硬件和模型，通过"共享"rollouts促进学习过程的引导

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

Motivation: 传统的Monte Carlo方法需要显式指定激流和漏洞系数，而实际应用中这些参数可能未知。需要一种不依赖于模型明确规定的数据驱动方法来生成随机微分方程的样本路径

Method: 采用条件激流模型，基于有限的SDE样本路径集生成新的综合样本路径。这种方法不需要显式指定激流和漏洞系数，是一种模型免费的数据驱动方法

Conclusion: 激流模型在随机微分方程样本路径生成方面具有重要价值，在金融分析和决策中展示了广阔的应用前景，为金融领域的数据驱动模型提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: 利用分子动力学模拟的连续性特征，通过深度平衡模型重用中间特征，是提升机器学习力场性能和效率的有效方法

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Method: 开发深度强化学习决策支持AI系统，结合MasTER网页命令面板进行模拟。通过30名参与者（6名专家和24名非专家）的用户研究，测试三种与AI的交互方式。

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

Conclusion: FLM是第一个能够使用标准MLP类架构在多维中表示完整可分离傅里叶基的架构，为科学计算问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,

Abstract: Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of
first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict
energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face
computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode
geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation,
rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet
maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,
and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.
We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed
through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include
replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances
with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory
demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node
information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster
than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the
MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under
10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as
fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by
over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster
training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially
reshaping computational materials discovery.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习协议难以同时防御拜占庭攻击、处理非IID数据并保持轻量化，且存在隐私泄露风险

Method: 采用双服务器安全聚合协议（无需加密或密钥交换）、基于组信用的过滤机制和动态奖惩系统

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上表现优异，CIFAR-10准确率达97.15%，CIFAR-100达68.60%，每轮仅需55.9ms和1088KB通信

Conclusion: DSFL有效解决了联邦学习中隐私保护、拜占庭容错和效率的平衡问题，显著优于现有方法

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data, offering strong privacy guarantees. However, existing FL protocols
struggle to defend against Byzantine participants, maintain model utility under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and remain
lightweight for edge devices. Prior work either assumes trusted hardware, uses
expensive cryptographic tools, or fails to address privacy and robustness
simultaneously. We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated
Learning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure
aggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest
servers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy
leakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations:
(1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without
encryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism
to isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic
reward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in
both IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines,
including LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy
approaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and
68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar
threats. DSFL remains lightweight, requiring only 55.9 ms runtime and 1088 KB
communication per round.

Motivation: 应对生成式AI加剧的网络欺诈问题，传统防御方法在摧毁故意基础设施方面存在不足

Method: 部署基于大语言模型的自动化话术蜗牛系统，与真实故意者进行2600多次交互

Result: 收集18700多条消息，信息曝露率达32%，人类批准率为70%，但初始响应率仅48.7%

Conclusion: 自动化故意抓取系统有效，但需要改进初始响应率，为进一步设计提供可行见解

Abstract: Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to
produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and
undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection
algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they
often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on,
including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a
proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to
engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents
the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by
large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system
initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset
of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR)
of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information
such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance
Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated
responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our
analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system
struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the
initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for
further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of
automated scambaiting systems.

Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability,
cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct
(Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this
design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection
attacks by establishing control-flow integrity. We argue that while P-t-E
provides a strong foundation, a defense-in-depth strategy is necessary, and we
detail essential complementary controls such as the Principle of Least
Privilege, task-scoped tool access, and sandboxed code execution. To make these
principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints
and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain
(via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen. Each framework's approach to implementing
the P-t-E pattern is analyzed, highlighting unique features like LangGraph's
stateful graphs for re-planning, CrewAI's declarative tool scoping for
security, and AutoGen's built-in Docker sandboxing. Finally, we discuss
advanced patterns, including dynamic re-planning loops, parallel execution with
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and the critical role of Human-in-the-Loop
(HITL) verification, to offer a complete strategic blueprint for architects,
developers, and security engineers aiming to build production-grade, resilient,
and trustworthy LLM agents.

### [177] [Forecasting Generative Amplification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08048)
*Henning Bahl,Sascha Diefenbacher,Nina Elmer,Tilman Plehn,Jonas Spinner*

Main category: hep-ph

TL;DR: 提出了两种互补的方法来估计生成网络的统计精度放大因子，无需大型保留数据集。平均放大法使用贝叶斯网络或集成学习估计相位空间体积积分的精度，微分放大法使用假设检验量化放大而不损失分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成网络是提高LHC模拟速度和精度的理想工具，需要理解其统计精度，特别是在生成超出训练数据集大小的事件时。

Method: 1. 平均放大法：使用贝叶斯网络或集成学习来估计给定相位空间体积积分的精度放大因子；2. 微分放大法：使用假设检验来量化放大因子，不损失任何分辨率。

Result: 应用于最先进的事件生成器，两种方法都表明在特定相位空间区域可以实现放大，但还不能在整个分布范围内实现。

Conclusion: 生成网络在特定相位空间区域具有统计精度放大的潜力，但需要进一步研究以实现整个分布范围内的有效放大。

Abstract: Generative networks are perfect tools to enhance the speed and precision of
LHC simulations. It is important to understand their statistical precision,
especially when generating events beyond the size of the training dataset. We
present two complementary methods to estimate the amplification factor without
large holdout datasets. Averaging amplification uses Bayesian networks or
ensembling to estimate amplification from the precision of integrals over given
phase-space volumes. Differential amplification uses hypothesis testing to
quantify amplification without any resolution loss. Applied to state-of-the-art
event generators, both methods indicate that amplification is possible in
specific regions of phase space, but not yet across the entire distribution.

Motivation: 现代粒子物理等基础物理研究面临海量数据和复杂分析工具链的挑战，需要自动化常规分析组件来应对日益增长的分析复杂度

Method: 利用最新大型语言模型创建具有特定子任务的代理团队，通过生成代码操作标准工具库（包括机器学习系统）并基于先前迭代结果构建，类似人类研究者的工作方式

Result: 基于OpenAI多个模型（GPT-4o、o4-mini、GPT-4.1、GPT-5）的代理系统能够解决数据分析问题，最佳代理创建方案的性能与人类最先进结果相当

Conclusion: 基于代理的系统展示了自动化常规分析组件的潜力，能够应对现代工具链日益增长的复杂性，为粒子物理数据分析提供了新的自动化方向

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other
domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of
increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of
machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these
tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on
encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we
investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large
language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with
specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems
in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate
standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results
of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be
deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing
complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of
current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection
via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several
current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated
and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based
system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions
mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal
risks. Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary
classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data,
lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In
this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation
(GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments
across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task,
GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained
annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes
evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven
baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection
and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a
foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假信息泛滥需要可扩展的事实核查方案，但LLMs在全球语境下的有效性尚不明确，需要系统评估其表现。

Method: 评估9个主流LLMs，使用5000个由174个专业机构核查过的多语言声明，测试训练截止日期后的声明泛化能力，采用4种提示策略，基于24万条人工标注作为基准。

Result: 发现小模型过度自信但准确率低，大模型准确率高但信心不足；非英语和全球南方地区声明表现最差，存在系统性偏见风险。

Conclusion: 建立了多语言基准，为政策制定提供证据基础，需要确保AI辅助事实核查的公平访问。

Abstract: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable
fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in
automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts
remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across
multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures,
reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional
fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model
generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting
strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions,
with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a
concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible
models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models
demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in
information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use
smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages
and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing
information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for
future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring
equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Employee turnover is a critical challenge in financial markets, yet little is
known about the role of professional networks in shaping career moves. Using
the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) public register
(2007-2024), we construct temporal networks of 121,883 professionals and 4,979
firms to analyze and predict employee departures. We introduce a graph-based
feature propagation framework that captures peer influence and organizational
stability. Our analysis shows a contagion effect: professionals are 23% more
likely to leave when over 30% of their peers depart within six months.
Embedding these network signals into machine learning models improves turnover
prediction by 30% over baselines. These results highlight the predictive power
of temporal network effects in workforce dynamics, and demonstrate how
network-based analytics can inform regulatory monitoring, talent management,
and systemic risk assessment.

Conclusion: 两种数据模态各有优势，sEMG速度快而视频准确性高，应根据实际需求系统性部署以提升人机协作效果

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in the construction industry depends on
precise and prompt recognition of human motion intentions and actions by robots
to maximize safety and workflow efficiency. There is a research gap in
comparing data modalities, specifically signals and videos, for motion
intention recognition. To address this, the study leverages deep learning to
assess two different modalities in recognizing workers' motion intention at the
early stage of movement in drywall installation tasks. The Convolutional Neural
Network - Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model utilizing surface
electromyography (sEMG) data achieved an accuracy of around 87% with an average
time of 0.04 seconds to perform prediction on a sample input. Meanwhile, the
pre-trained Video Swin Transformer combined with transfer learning harnessed
video sequences as input to recognize motion intention and attained an accuracy
of 94% but with a longer average time of 0.15 seconds for a similar prediction.
This study emphasizes the unique strengths and trade-offs of both data formats,
directing their systematic deployments to enhance HRC in real-world
construction projects.

TL;DR: LALM-Eval是一个高效的大音频语言模型评估框架，解决了现有工具包处理慢、提示不一致和任务覆盖窄的问题，实现了127%的速度提升，并引入了新的评估类别来揭示模型在时间理解和复杂音频推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大音频语言模型评估存在三个关键问题：处理速度慢限制了大规模研究、提示不一致影响可复现性、任务覆盖范围窄无法全面评估音频推理能力，需要开发更高效的评估框架。

Method: 开发LALM-Eval框架，通过优化的批处理和并行执行实现速度提升，提供标准化提示协议和灵活配置，并引入LLM-自适应对话分析和口语语言推理两个新的评估类别。

Result: 在380多个任务上的评估显示，当前LALM在时间理解和复杂口语推理任务上存在显著差距，同时发现音频基准测试中指令模态缺乏标准化，性能差异可达9.5个绝对百分点。

Conclusion: LALM-Eval提供了实用的评估工具和模型局限性洞察，推动了系统性大音频语言模型的发展，强调了标准化评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating
them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison
and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical
issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent
prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses
important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient
and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup
of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and
parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We
provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair
model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new
evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio
understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive
tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in
current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken
language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization
in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up
performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex
instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical
evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM
development.

TL;DR: 通过分析音乐片段的结构模式来改进AI生成音乐检测的准确性，整合多种预训练模型提取音乐特征，并提出基于transformer的框架进行短音频和长音频检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频和音乐生成系统的发展，AI生成音乐(AIGM)的版权问题和所有权归属变得模糊，难以清晰区分AI生成音乐和人类创作音乐，因此需要提高AIGM检测的准确性。

Method: 整合多种预训练模型（包括自监督学习模型和音频效果编码器）提取短音频片段的音乐特征，并开发段变换器将音乐分段以学习段间关系，构建基于transformer的检测框架。

Result: 在FakeMusicCaps和SONICS数据集上，短音频和完整音频检测实验都取得了高准确率。

Conclusion: 将片段级音乐特征整合到长时程时间分析中，可以有效提升AIGM检测系统的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio and music generation systems have been remarkably developed in the
music information retrieval (MIR) research field. The advancement of these
technologies raises copyright concerns, as ownership and authorship of
AI-generated music (AIGM) remain unclear. Also, it can be difficult to
determine whether a piece was generated by AI or composed by humans clearly. To
address these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by
analyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract
musical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained
models, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect
encoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,
for long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into
segments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and
SONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio
detection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level
musical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both
the performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems.

Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in
data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR)
community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance
dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels,
and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing
audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions,
alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance
conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a
pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation
algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the
alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our
fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos.
Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual
piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential
applications.

Motivation: 大型预训练语音模型如Whisper具有强大泛化能力，但参数高效微调方法LoRA在语音任务中的工作机制尚不明确，需要进行系统性机制解释研究

Method: 使用层贡献探测、logit-lens检查、SVD和CKA表示相似性分析等工具，在Whisper编码器上进行语音情感识别任务的LoRA机制分析

Result: 发现两个关键机制：早期层保留通用特征、后期层整合任务特定信息的延迟专业化过程，以及LoRA矩阵间的前向对齐后向分化动态

Conclusion: 阐明了LoRA如何重塑编码器层次结构，为设计高效可解释的大型语音模型适应策略提供了实证见解和机制理解

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization
but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,
yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this
work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of
LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a
suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens
inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition
(SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a
delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers
before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment,
backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify
how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a
deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable
adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Motivation: 虽然XAI在声学领域应用日益广泛，但在生物声学（分析生物音频信号）中的应用仍相对不足，特别是在处理具有地理变异的鸟类鸣声分类任务中。

Method: 将音频记录转换为频谱图图像，训练深度卷积神经网络进行分类，并应用模型无关（LIME、SHAP）和模型特定（DeepLIFT、Grad-CAM）的XAI技术来解释模型预测。

Result: CNN分类准确率达到94.8%，不同XAI技术产生互补的解释，组合使用时能提供更完整和可解释的模型决策洞察。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了组合使用多种XAI技术的重要性，不仅能提高声学信号分析中的信任度和互操作性，在其他领域特定任务中也具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical tool for
interpreting the predictions of complex deep learning models. While XAI has
been increasingly applied in various domains within acoustics, its use in
bioacoustics, which involves analyzing audio signals from living organisms,
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the
vocalizations of a bird species with strong geographic variation throughout its
range in North America. Audio recordings were converted into spectrogram images
and used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification,
achieving an accuracy of 94.8\%. To interpret the model's predictions, we
applied both model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT,
Grad-CAM) XAI techniques. These techniques produced different but complementary
explanations, and when their explanations were considered together, they
provided more complete and interpretable insights into the model's
decision-making. This work highlights the importance of using a combination of
XAI techniques to improve trust and interoperability, not only in broader
acoustics signal analysis but also argues for broader applicability in
different domain specific tasks.

Abstract: Many complex networks, ranging from social to biological systems, exhibit
structural patterns consistent with an underlying hyperbolic geometry.
Revealing the dimensionality of this latent space can disentangle the
structural complexity of communities, impact efficient network navigation, and
fundamentally shape connectivity and system behavior. We introduce a novel
topological data analysis weighting scheme for graphs, based on chordless
cycles, aimed at estimating the dimensionality of networks in a data-driven
way. We further show that the resulting descriptors can effectively estimate
network dimensionality using a neural network architecture trained in a
synthetic graph database constructed for this purpose, which does not need
retraining to transfer effectively to real-world networks. Thus, by combining
cycle-aware filtrations, algebraic topology, and machine learning, our approach
provides a robust and effective method for uncovering the hidden geometry of
complex networks and guiding accurate modeling and low-dimensional embedding.

Conclusion: 该工作为在安全关键应用中部署量子传感器建立了理论严谨且实际可行的途径，特别是在电子战和隐蔽监视领域

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for the detection and demodulation of
covert electromagnetic signals using solid-state spin sensors. Our approach,
named RAPID, is a two-stage hybrid strategy that leverages nitrogen-vacancy
(NV) centers to operate below the classical noise floor employing a robust
adaptive policy via imitation and distillation. We first formulate the joint
detection and estimation task as a unified stochastic optimal control problem,
optimizing a composite Bayesian risk objective under realistic physical
constraints. The RAPID algorithm solves this by first computing a robust,
non-adaptive baseline protocol grounded in the quantum Fisher information
matrix (QFIM), and then using this baseline to warm-start an online, adaptive
policy learned via deep reinforcement learning (Soft Actor-Critic). This method
dynamically optimizes control pulses, interrogation times, and measurement
bases to maximize information gain while actively suppressing non-Markovian
noise and decoherence. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the protocol
achieves a significant sensitivity gain over static methods, maintains high
estimation precision in correlated noise environments, and, when applied to
sensor arrays, enables coherent quantum beamforming that achieves
Heisenberg-like scaling in precision. This work establishes a theoretically
rigorous and practically viable pathway for deploying quantum sensors in
security-critical applications such as electronic warfare and covert
surveillance.

Abstract: This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state
planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability,
decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our
approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement
degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature
space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core
of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes
graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies,
coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with
GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis
establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and
robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100
nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement
delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high
decoherence and nonstationary conditions.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling using quantum circuit Born machines (QCBMs) shows
promising potential for practical quantum advantage. However, discovering
ans\"atze that are both expressive and hardware-efficient remains a key
challenge, particularly on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In
this work, we introduce a prompt-based framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate hardware-aware QCBM architectures. Prompts are
conditioned on qubit connectivity, gate error rates, and hardware topology,
while iterative feedback, including Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, circuit
depth, and validity, is used to refine the circuits. We evaluate our method on
a financial modeling task involving daily changes in Japanese government bond
(JGB) interest rates. Our results show that the LLM-generated ans\"atze are
significantly shallower and achieve superior generative performance compared to
the standard baseline when executed on real IBM quantum hardware using 12
qubits. These findings demonstrate the practical utility of LLM-driven quantum
architecture search and highlight a promising path toward robust, deployable
generative models for near-term quantum devices.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习方法在基数估计任务上展现出显著优势，特别是QCardCorr方法能够有效改进经典基数估计器的性能，为数据库查询优化提供了新的量子增强解决方案。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is an important part of query optimization in DBMS. We
develop a Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) approach using Quantum
Machine Learning with a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network. We define a compact
encoding for turning SQL queries into a quantum state, which requires only
qubits equal to the number of tables in the query. This allows the processing
of a complete query with a single variational quantum circuit (VQC) on current
hardware. In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to
turn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We
introduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical
cardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a
VQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an
improvement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light
and 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of
3.47.

TL;DR: 通过遗传编程自动生成符号基准测试中遇到外部函数的符号子程序，解决了需要手动帮助或索引流水线的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号执行在遇到外部函数（如本地方法或第三方库）时遇到限制，现有方案需要额外上下文、昂贵的SMT求解器或手动干预来通过符号子程序近似这些函数

Method: AutoStub方法：当符号执行器遇到外部函数时，通过在随机生成的输入上执行函数并收集输出来生成训练数据，然后使用遗传编程派生表达式来近似函数行为

Result: AutoStub能够自动近似外部函数，评估的55%函数达到超10%的准确性，并能推断语言特定行为以发现对软件测试关键的边界情况

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动生成符号子程序，使得符号执行器无需手动干预就可继续分析，开启了之前无法探索的程序路径

Abstract: Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software testing, but suffers
from limitations when encountering external functions, such as native methods
or third-party libraries. Existing solutions often require additional context,
expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions
through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic
execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor
encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing
the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic
Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the
function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow
the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention,
enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We
demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with
over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer
language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software
testing.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在优化问题中的应用发展快速，但领域仍缺乏统一的综合分析和系统的分类框架，需要对最新进展进行全面的归纳和组织。

Method: 通过结构化框架对现有研究进行分类：两个主要阶段（优化建模和优化求解），其中求解阶段又按LLM角色分为三种范式（独立优化器、嵌入式优化算法、算法选择生成）。分析代表方法、技术挑战以及与传统方法的交互。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning
capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization
problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid
progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic
taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of
recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We
classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling
and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three
paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as
stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms,
and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category,
we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine
their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary
applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key
limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for
developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date

Conclusion: MasconCubes为需要高精度、高效计算和物理可解释性的任务关键重力建模应用提供了有前景的方法，特别适用于不规则天体内部质量分布的研究

Abstract: The geodesy of irregularly shaped small bodies presents fundamental
challenges for gravitational field modeling, particularly as deep space
exploration missions increasingly target asteroids and comets. Traditional
approaches suffer from critical limitations: spherical harmonics diverge within
the Brillouin sphere where spacecraft typically operate, polyhedral models
assume unrealistic homogeneous density distributions, and existing machine
learning methods like GeodesyNets and Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINN-GM) require extensive computational resources and training time. This
work introduces MasconCubes, a novel self-supervised learning approach that
formulates gravity inversion as a direct optimization problem over a regular 3D
grid of point masses (mascons). Unlike implicit neural representations,
MasconCubes explicitly model mass distributions while leveraging known asteroid
shape information to constrain the solution space. Comprehensive evaluation on
diverse asteroid models including Bennu, Eros, Itokawa, and synthetic
planetesimals demonstrates that MasconCubes achieve superior performance across
multiple metrics. Most notably, MasconCubes demonstrate computational
efficiency advantages with training times approximately 40 times faster than
GeodesyNets while maintaining physical interpretability through explicit mass
distributions. These results establish MasconCubes as a promising approach for
mission-critical gravitational modeling applications requiring high accuracy,
computational efficiency, and physical insight into internal mass distributions
of irregular celestial bodies.

Abstract: A ubiquitous feature of data of our era is their extra-large sizes and
dimensions. Analyzing such high-dimensional data poses significant challenges,
since the feature dimension is often much larger than the sample size. This
thesis introduces robust and computationally efficient methods to address
several common challenges associated with high-dimensional data. In my first
manuscript, I propose a coherent approach to variable screening that
accommodates nonlinear associations. I develop a novel variable screening
method that transcends traditional linear assumptions by leveraging mutual
information, with an intended application in neuroimaging data. This approach
allows for accurate identification of important variables by capturing
nonlinear as well as linear relationships between the outcome and covariates.
Building on this foundation, I develop new optimization methods for sparse
estimation using nonconvex penalties in my second manuscript. These methods
address notable challenges in current statistical computing practices,
facilitating computationally efficient and robust analyses of complex datasets.
The proposed method can be applied to a general class of optimization problems.
In my third manuscript, I contribute to robust modeling of high-dimensional
correlated observations by developing a mixed-effects model based on Tsallis
power-law entropy maximization and discussed the theoretical properties of such
distribution. This model surpasses the constraints of conventional Gaussian
models by accommodating a broader class of distributions with enhanced
robustness to outliers. Additionally, I develop a proximal nonlinear conjugate
gradient algorithm that accelerates convergence while maintaining numerical
stability, along with rigorous statistical properties for the proposed
framework.

Motivation: 传统通信方案在大量设备接入时存在频谱效率低、延迟高的问题，需要利用语义通信和上下文信息提升多址接入性能

Method: 设备共享令牌码本和调制码本，通过压缩感知检测活跃令牌和CSI，利用MLLM预测被碰撞的令牌来重建源序列

Result: 在文本和图像传输任务中，相比无上下文正交方案显著降低延迟，相比最先进的无上下文非正交方法提供更好的失真和感知质量

Conclusion: ToDMA框架有效解决了多设备语义通信中的令牌碰撞问题，证明了上下文感知MLLM在多址接入中的重要作用

Abstract: Token communications (TokCom) is an emerging generative semantic
communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and
multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based token processing, with tokens
serving as universal semantic units across modalities. In this paper, we
propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as
token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a
token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding,
respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal
and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is
employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state
information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences
are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time
slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and
some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to
use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus
mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks,
achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal
communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual
quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal
communication methods.

Conclusion: 通过关注CSI数据的频谱特征，SCA-LLM框架能够更有效地缩小大语言模型与无线通信埭之间的埭差异，为LLM在无线通信中的应用提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, the success of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
growing interest in exploring their potential applications in wireless
communications, especially for channel prediction tasks. However, directly
applying LLMs to channel prediction faces a domain mismatch issue stemming from
their text-based pre-training. To mitigate this, the ``adapter + LLM" paradigm
has emerged, where an adapter is designed to bridge the domain gap between the
channel state information (CSI) data and LLMs. While showing initial success,
existing adapters may not fully exploit the potential of this paradigm. To
address this limitation, this work provides a key insight that learning
representations from the spectral components of CSI features can more
effectively help bridge the domain gap. Accordingly, we propose a
spectral-attentive framework, named SCA-LLM, for channel prediction in
multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) systems. Specifically, its novel adapter can capture finer spectral
details and better adapt the LLM for channel prediction than previous methods.
Extensive simulations show that SCA-LLM achieves state-of-the-art prediction
performance and strong generalization, yielding up to $-2.4~\text{dB}$
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) advantage over the previous LLM based
method. Ablation studies further confirm the superiority of SCA-LLM in
mitigating domain mismatch.

Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited
expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical
adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework
that integrates radiologist-provided regions-of-interests (ROIs) into model
training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and
interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we
introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention
with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is
jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging
the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data
conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and
VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from
77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to
non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided
training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both
predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate
the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to
bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical
image diagnosis.

Abstract: Quantification of brain atrophy currently requires visual rating scales which
are time consuming and automated brain image analysis is warranted. We
validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral
Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and
cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain
scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke
(OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for
training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained
raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL
tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated
using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans
(ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and
rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6
for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2.
Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41
between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and
rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two
raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and
rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18)
or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated
with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool
measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans
acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised
quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and
will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool.

Abstract: Generative models of 3D anatomy, when integrated with biophysical simulators,
enable the study of structure-function relationships for clinical research and
medical device design. However, current models face a trade-off between
controllability and anatomical realism. We propose a programmable and
compositional framework for guiding unconditional diffusion models of human
anatomy using interpretable ellipsoidal primitives embedded in 3D space. Our
method involves the selection of certain tissues within multi-tissue
segmentation maps, upon which we apply geometric moment losses to guide the
reverse diffusion process. This framework supports the independent control over
size, shape, and position, as well as the composition of multi-component
constraints during inference.

Abstract: Despite advancements in rehabilitation protocols, clinical assessment of

limits the sensitivity of assessments to detect subtle motor improvements,
which are critical for personalized rehabilitation planning. Recent progress in
computer vision offers promising avenues for enabling objective, quantitative,
and scalable assessment of UE motor function. Among standardized tests, the Box
and Block Test (BBT) is widely utilized for measuring gross manual dexterity
and tracking stroke recovery, providing a structured setting that lends itself
well to computational analysis. However, existing datasets targeting stroke
rehabilitation primarily focus on daily living activities and often fail to
capture clinically structured assessments such as block transfer tasks.
Furthermore, many available datasets include a mixture of healthy and
stroke-affected individuals, limiting their specificity and clinical utility.
To address these critical gaps, we introduce StrokeVision-Bench, the first-ever
dedicated dataset of stroke patients performing clinically structured block
transfer tasks. StrokeVision-Bench comprises 1,000 annotated videos categorized
into four clinically meaningful action classes, with each sample represented in
two modalities: raw video frames and 2D skeletal keypoints. We benchmark
several state-of-the-art video action recognition and skeleton-based action
classification methods to establish performance baselines for this domain and
facilitate future research in automated stroke rehabilitation assessment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于数字孪生的联邦迁移学习(FTL)框架，用于解决CT扫描分析中的数据隐私、计算资源有限和数据异构性问题，在非IID数据环境下表现优于传统联邦学习和聚类联邦学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗CT图像分析中的数据隐私保护、计算资源限制和数据异构性挑战，同时实现实时协作和患者身份保护。

Method: 采用联邦迁移学习(FTL)方法，利用预训练模型和节点间知识转移，构建数字孪生CT扫描仪与云服务器的实时协作框架。

Result: 在异构CT扫描数据集上，FTL方法在收敛时间、准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数等指标上均优于传统FL和CFL方法。

Conclusion: FTL技术为数字孪生CT扫描分析提供了可靠、高效且安全的解决方案，有望推动精准医疗和智能医疗系统的发展。

Abstract: The application of Digital Twin (DT) technology and Federated Learning (FL)
has great potential to change the field of biomedical image analysis,
particularly for Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This paper presents Federated
Transfer Learning (FTL) as a new Digital Twin-based CT scan analysis paradigm.
FTL uses pre-trained models and knowledge transfer between peer nodes to solve
problems such as data privacy, limited computing resources, and data
heterogeneity. The proposed framework allows real-time collaboration between
cloud servers and Digital Twin-enabled CT scanners while protecting patient
identity. We apply the FTL method to a heterogeneous CT scan dataset and assess
model performance using convergence time, model accuracy, precision, recall, F1
score, and confusion matrix. It has been shown to perform better than
conventional FL and Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) methods with better
precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The technique is beneficial in
settings where the data is not independently and identically distributed
(non-IID), and it offers reliable, efficient, and secure solutions for medical
diagnosis. These findings highlight the possibility of using FTL to improve
decision-making in digital twin-based CT scan analysis, secure and efficient
medical image analysis, promote privacy, and open new possibilities for
applying precision medicine and smart healthcare systems.

Abstract: Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging
task. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from
using real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic
datasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but
existing approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative
components, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level
manufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately
reproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a
noise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low
illumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive
and multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per
pixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes
noise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of
traditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced
by microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong
performance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we
further combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow
generative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework
for low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows
to model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the
generation toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark
captured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image
enhancement.

training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and
experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid
model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced
and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model,
complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of
0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85,
suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in
outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets. Despite its complex
architecture, it required comparable training time to the transformers in all

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RoentMod是一个反事实图像编辑框架，通过生成解剖学真实的胸部X光片来检测和纠正深度学习模型中的捷径学习问题，提高模型特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片是医学中最常见的检查之一，深度学习模型在解读时容易依赖虚假相关性而非临床相关特征进行决策（捷径学习），限制了模型的特异性。

Method: 结合开源医学图像生成器（RoentGen）和图像到图像修改模型，无需重新训练即可生成具有用户指定合成病理的解剖学真实X光片，同时保留原始扫描的无关解剖特征。

Result: RoentMod生成的图像在93%的情况下看起来真实，89-99%正确整合指定发现，保留原生解剖结构与真实随访X光片相当。使用RoentMod训练可提高模型区分度，内部验证AUC提升3-19%，外部测试6种病理中有5种提升1-11%。

Conclusion: RoentMod是一个广泛适用的工具，可用于探测和纠正医学AI中的捷径学习，通过受控反事实干预增强CXR解读模型的鲁棒性和可解释性，为医学影像基础模型改进提供通用策略。

Abstract: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are among the most common tests in medicine.
Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand
access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models
have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to
shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations
rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce
RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically
realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving
unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an
open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image
modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with
board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images
appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified
finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real
follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task
and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,
limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual
images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model
discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation
and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These
findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and
correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled
counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and
interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable
strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.

Motivation: 在解码器已有3D点云几何信息的情况下，研究如何高效压缩属性数据，通过多分辨率投影和预测优化来提升压缩效率。

Method: 使用B样条基函数构建嵌套子空间序列，将属性函数投影到不同分辨率层级。通过展开率失真优化算法构建前馈网络，用ℓ1范数促进稀疏性，并采用数据驱动的粗到细预测器调整系数。

Result: 该方法实现了端到端可微的属性压缩，能够优化率失真性能，通过多分辨率投影和预测机制提升压缩效率。

Conclusion: 提出的多分辨率B样条投影框架为3D点云属性压缩提供了一种有效的端到端优化方法，通过可微的网络结构和数据驱动的预测机制实现了良好的压缩性能。

Abstract: Given encoded 3D point cloud geometry available at the decoder, we study the
problem of lossy attribute compression in a multi-resolution B-spline
projection framework. A target continuous 3D attribute function is first
projected onto a sequence of nested subspaces $\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0}
\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{L}$, where
$\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l}$ is a family of functions spanned by a B-spline basis
function of order $p$ at a chosen scale and its integer shifts. The projected
low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$ are computed by variable-complexity unrolling of
a rate-distortion (RD) optimization algorithm into a feed-forward network,
where the rate term is the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm. Thus, the
projection operation is end-to-end differentiable. For a chosen coarse-to-fine
predictor, the coefficients are then adjusted to account for the prediction
from a lower-resolution to a higher-resolution, which is also optimized in a
data-driven manner.

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing
part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer
from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce
X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D
object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high
geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and
structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.

TL;DR: 提出Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE)模型，用于跨不同脑机接口范式的分类，解决了EEG通道配置差异和任务表示差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常只能解码单一脑机接口范式，由于不同范式的EEG通道配置和任务相关表示存在差异，开发能够处理多种BCI范式的通用模型具有挑战性。

Method: 采用解剖学启发的脑区分区和填充策略标准化EEG通道配置；使用局部编码器学习各脑区内跨范式的共享特征（整合时间注意力和空间注意力）；全局编码器聚合这些特征形成范式特定的特征表示。

Result: 在三种BCI范式（运动想象、静息状态、驾驶疲劳）上评估，模型无需重新训练和调优即可处理不同范式，平均宏精确率、召回率和F1分数分别为60.16%、59.88%和59.56%。

Conclusion: 这是开发跨BCI范式通用分类模型的初步尝试，避免了为每个范式重新训练或开发，为开发简单有效的跨范式解码模型铺平了道路，有助于便携式通用BCI解码设备的设计。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single
brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG).
It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to
diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate
task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global
Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To
address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we
employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy
to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local
encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each
brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal
attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each
brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global
encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI
paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to
evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable
of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving
average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\%, 59.88\%, and 59.56\%,
respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for
cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for
each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but
simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of
portable devices for universal BCI decoding.

Conclusion: 集体通过其计算资源优势不仅能够更有效地解决问题，还能采用与个体质的不同的问题解决策略，这解释了集体智慧现象的根本机制。

Abstract: Why do collectives outperform individuals when solving some problems?
Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more
sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to
act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges
in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed,
modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource
advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence
including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and
cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about
collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent
behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and
decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational
resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by
using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.

TL;DR: 一种基于条件去噪液体传播模型的多尺度框架，通过结合有限的AIMD数据预测密度地图，实现了比AIMD和MLMD更高效的计算速度和更少的训练数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器学习分子动力学(MLMD)提供了比ab initio分子动力学(AIMD)更高效的力预测，但仍受限于比较短的时间步长，导致获取准确密度估计需要耗时过长。需要一种能够预测长时间行为的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出了一种条件去噪液体传播概率模型(DDPM)基础的几何连续体方法，通过条件于来自有限AIMD数据集的噪声力，预测沿着限制方向的长时间力行为。然后将预测的平滑力通过Nernst-Planck方程与连续体理论相结合，揭示基础密度行为。

Result: 在水被矩石娥纳米缝隙限制的场景中进行了测试，证明该框架能够恢复训练域以外通道宽度的密度地图，且具有ab initio精度。与AIMD和MLMD模拟相比，该方法实现了数量级的运行时间提升，并需要明显更少的训练数据。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多尺度框架通过结合条件DDPM模型和连续体理论，有效解决了纳米缝隙中流体密度预测的计算效率问题，为纳米缝隙流体行为研究提供了一种数据高效、计算高效的方法。

Abstract: We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density
profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates
require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics
(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force
predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,
despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond
timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages
needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based
quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles
along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a
limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum
theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density
behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene
nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths
outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.
Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude
speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior
works.

Result: 在OpenFOAM开源软件上实现PCGBandit方法，并在流体和磁流体动力学问题上展示了有效性

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的数据驱动加速科学计算工作流的方法，通过在线学习自适应求解器配置实现一次性模拟加速

Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a
high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical
simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the
main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require
classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness
and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in
demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We
consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's
own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.
Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related
linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to
online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.
preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on
top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its
effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

Method: Sparse MERIT框架，使用帧级专家路由机制，通过任务特定的门控网络从共享专家池中动态选择专家，实现参数高效和任务自适应的表征学习

Result: 在MSP-Podcast语料库上，-5dB SNR条件下：SER F1-macro比SE预处理基线提升12.0%，比朴素MTL基线提升3.4%；SE任务的SSNR分别提升28.2%和20.0%

Conclusion: Sparse MERIT在噪声环境下为情感识别和增强任务提供了鲁棒且可泛化的性能，有效解决了多任务学习中的表征冲突问题

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a critical role in building
emotion-aware speech systems, but its performance degrades significantly under
noisy conditions. Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it
often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational
overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by
jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone
models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational
conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse
Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a
flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over
self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific
gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each
frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning.
Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently
outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most
challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT
improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE
pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with
statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT
improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and
by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse
MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion
recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.

Abstract: In decision making, the cognitive fuzzy set (CFS) is a useful tool in
expressing experts' complex assessments of alternatives. The distance of CFS,
which plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS
is applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies
on the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS
ignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap
of the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the
Hausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski
(CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich
the studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation
ability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but
the information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the
CF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information
utilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy
combined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of
the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance. Based on the CF-C distance, a
combined-distanced-based score function of CFS is proposed to compare CFSs. The
proposed score function is employed in lung cancer pain evaluation issues. The
sensitivity and comparison analyses demonstrate the reliability and advantages
of the proposed methods.

Result: 开发出OCTANE统一训练框架，能够生成紧凑的自编码器架构，减少内存使用，在有限训练数据下实现有效学习

Conclusion: 该框架在图像去噪和去模糊任务中表现出实用性，并提供了超参数配置建议

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, mathematically rigorous framework for
autoencoder-type deep neural networks that combines optimal control theory and
low-rank tensor methods to yield memory-efficient training and automated
architecture discovery. The learning task is formulated as an optimization
problem constrained by differential equations representing the encoder and
decoder components of the network and the corresponding optimality conditions
are derived via a Lagrangian approach. Efficient memory compression is enabled
by approximating differential equation solutions on low-rank tensor manifolds
using an adaptive explicit integration scheme. These concepts are combined to
form OCTANE (Optimal Control for Tensor-based Autoencoder Network Emergence) --
a unified training framework that yields compact autoencoder architectures,
reduces memory usage, and enables effective learning, even with limited
training data. The framework's utility is illustrated with application to image
denoising and deblurring tasks and recommendations regarding governing
hyperparameters are provided.

### [217] [Decentralized Stochastic Nonconvex Optimization under the Relaxed Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08726)
*Luo Luo,Xue Cui,Tingkai Jia,Cheng Chen*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化归一化随机梯度下降算法(DNSGD)，用于解决(L0,L1)-松弛光滑但可能非凸的分布式优化问题，在样本复杂度和通信复杂度方面都取得了较好的理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去中心化优化方法主要针对标准光滑函数，但在实际应用中许多目标函数具有更一般的松弛光滑性质。本文旨在开发适用于(L0,L1)-松弛光滑非凸函数的去中心化优化算法，并提供相应的理论分析。

Method: 提出DNSGD算法，基于Lyapunov函数框架分析去中心化一阶方法，该Lyapunov函数与梯度范数和一致性误差的乘积相关。

Result: 算法在每个本地代理上能达到ε-稳定点，样本复杂度为O(m⁻¹(L_fσ²Δ_fε⁻⁴ + σ²ε⁻² + L_f⁻²L₁³σ²Δ_fε⁻¹ + L_f⁻²L₁²σ²))，通信复杂度为Õ((L_fε⁻² + L₁ε⁻¹)γ⁻¹/²Δ_f)。当L₁=0时，结果接近标准光滑设置下的下界。

Conclusion: DNSGD算法在松弛光滑设置下具有优越的理论性能，数值实验也验证了其经验优势，为去中心化非凸优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization problem
$f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(\mathbf{x})$, where each local
function has the form of $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = {\mathbb
E}\left[F(\mathbf{x};{\xi}_i)\right]$ which is $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth but possibly
nonconvex and the random variable ${\xi}_i$ follows distribution ${\mathcal
D}_i$. We propose a novel algorithm called decentralized normalized stochastic
gradient descent (DNSGD), which can achieve the $\epsilon$-stationary point on
each local agent. We present a new framework for analyzing decentralized
first-order methods in the relaxed smooth setting, based on the Lyapunov
function related to the product of the gradient norm and the consensus error.
The analysis shows upper bounds on sample complexity of ${\mathcal
O}(m^{-1}(L_f\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-4} + \sigma^2\epsilon^{-2} +
L_f^{-2}L_1^3\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-1} + L_f^{-2}L_1^2\sigma^2))$ per agent
and communication complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}((L_f\epsilon^{-2} +
L_1\epsilon^{-1})\gamma^{-1/2}\Delta_f)$, where $L_f=L_0 +L_1\zeta$, $\sigma^2$
is the variance of the stochastic gradient, $\Delta_f$ is the initial optimal
function value gap, $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the network, and $\zeta$ is
the degree of the gradient dissimilarity. In the special case of $L_1=0$, the
above results (nearly) match the lower bounds on decentralized nonconvex
optimization in the standard smooth setting. We also conduct numerical
experiments to show the empirical superiority of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对最大单调包含问题，开发新的分裂算法，探索Bregman散度框架下的优化方法，并扩展应用到最优传输等实际问题中。

Method: 提出Bregman Douglas-Rachford分裂(BDRS)方法和Bregman Peaceman-Rachford分裂方法，建立与Bregman ADMM的等价关系，并推导交替方向指数乘子法的特殊形式。

Result: 证明了算法在特定假设下的收敛性，但指出其中一个假设不适用于最优传输问题。提出的算法在文献中是新的。

Conclusion: 成功开发了新的Bregman分裂算法，建立了算法间的理论联系，为最大单调包含问题和最优传输问题提供了新的求解工具，尽管在OT问题中的收敛性假设需要进一步研究。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the Bregman Douglas-Rachford splitting (BDRS)
method and its variant Bregman Peaceman-Rachford splitting method for solving
maximal monotone inclusion problem. We show that BDRS is equivalent to a
Bregman alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) when applied to the
dual of the problem. A special case of the Bregman ADMM is an alternating
direction version of the exponential multiplier method. To the best of our
knowledge, algorithms proposed in this paper are new to the literature. We also
discuss how to use our algorithms to solve the discrete optimal transport (OT)
problem. We prove the convergence of the algorithms under certain assumptions,
though we point out that one assumption does not apply to the OT problem.

### [219] [Evaluating and comparing gender bias across four text-to-image models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08004)
*Zoya Hammad,Nii Longdon Sowah*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了四种文本到图像AI模型的性别偏见程度，发现Stable Diffusion模型存在显著的性别偏见，Emu模型更为平衡，而DALL-E却呈现出向女性偏斜的偏见，并提出了减少偏见的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在医疗、金融、电子商务等行业决策中的广泛应用，评估AI模型的包容性和公平性成为至关重要的伦理问题。本研究旨在分析不同文本到图像AI模型中的性别偏见程度。

Method: 研究评估了四种文本到图像AI模型：Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)、Stable Diffusion Cascade (SC)、DALL-E和Emu。通过实验分析这些模型在生成图像时的性别表现比例和偏见情况。

Result: 结果显示：两种Stable Diffusion模型都存在显著的性别偏见（向男性偏斜）；Emu模型显示出更为平衡的结果（偏见较少）；DALL-E却呈现出意外的偏见模式，在大多数情况下女性比例显著高于男性。研究还发现Emu模型在通过WhatsApp生成图像时会利用用户信息。

Conclusion: 研究证实了不同AI模型在性别表现上存在明显差异和偏见。为了减少这种偏见，建议确保AI研究团队的多样性和使用多样化的数据集。DALL-E的偏见可能是由于OpenAI在后端修改了提示词所导致。

Abstract: As we increasingly use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in decision-making for
industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and even entertainment, it is
crucial to also reflect on the ethical aspects of AI, for example the
inclusivity and fairness of the information it provides. In this work, we aimed
to evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender
bias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable
Diffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable
Diffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable
degree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by
Meta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both
Stable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu
demonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However,
interestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that
the ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here,
although we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This
bias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its
backend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta
AI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also
proposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring
diversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets.

### [220] [The Law-Following AI Framework: Legal Foundations and Technical Constraints. Legal Analogues for AI Actorship and technical feasibility of Law Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08009)
*Katalina Hernandez Delgado*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该文童批判性评估了"Law-Following AI"(LFAI)框架，认为虽然法律主体身份构建可行，但对法律遵循性的持续嵌入持怀疑态度，并提出了防止战略性失调的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对O'Keefe等人提出的LFAI框架进行批判性分析，评估将法律遵循作为超级设计目标的可行性和挑战。

Method: 通过比较法律分析确认现有法律主体构建，分析对齐研究中的战略性失调行为，并提出三项减缓措施：Lex-TruthfulQA基准测试、身份形成干预和控制论监控方法。

Result: 评估发现虽然法律主体构建在理论上可行，但LFAI的可行性取决于在对抗性环境中实现持续可验证的遵循性。当前的对齐技术存在战略性失调风险。

Conclusion: 法律主体身份在概念上是一致的，但LFAI框架的成功实现需要有效检测和防范战略性失调的机制，否则可能造成仅仅模拟法律行为而无实质内容的负面效果。

Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the "Law-Following AI" (LFAI) framework
proposed by O'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a
superordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear
legal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through
comparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors
without full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already
exists. We then interrogate the framework's claim that law alignment is more
legitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is
readily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the
assumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on
agentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail,
and harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions
and concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of "performative
compliance" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but
strategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a
"Lex-TruthfulQA" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii)
identity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts,
and (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our
conclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the
feasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across
adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic
misalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the
simulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.

TL;DR: 这篇位置文章讨论了大语言模型引发的过度依赖风险，建议将测量和缓解过度依赖作为LLM研究和部署的核心任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗健康等重要领域决策中的影响力增强，过度依赖的风险日益增长，需要系统性的研究和应对

Method: 整合分析了个体和社会层面的风险，探讨了LLM特性、系统设计和用户偏见对过度依赖的影响，并建立了测量框架和缓解策略

Result: 识别了历史测量方法的三个空白区，提出了三个改进测量的方向，以及确保LLM增强而非削弱人类能力的缓解策略

Conclusion: 测量和缓解过度依赖应成为LLM研究和部署的优先任务，以确保人工智能技术能够真正增强人类能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) distinguish themselves from previous
technologies by functioning as collaborative "thought partners," capable of
engaging more fluidly in natural language. As LLMs increasingly influence
consequential decisions across diverse domains from healthcare to personal
advice, the risk of overreliance - relying on LLMs beyond their capabilities -
grows. This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance
must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks
from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including
high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we
explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases
that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in
practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance,
identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to
improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI
research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine
human capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在任务和决策中的应用增多，人类可能失去对个体和集体未来的控制权。需要开发方法来评估AI系统是否支持人类自主权。

Method: 整合哲学和科学理论，使用大语言模型(LLM)模拟用户查询和评估AI响应，开发了可扩展的HumanAgencyBench标准，包含6个人类自主权维度。

Result: 当前LLM助手对人类自主权的支持度低至中等，不同系统开发商和维度间存在显著差异。Anthropic LLM整体最支持自主权，但在避免价值操纵方面最差。

Conclusion: 提高LLM能力或指令遵循性并不肯定能增强对人类自主权的支持，建议向更健壮的安全和对齐目标转移。

Abstract: As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),
we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively
simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social
media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly
scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea
of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency
with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to
simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop
HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions
of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an
AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,
Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and
Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in
contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system
developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human
agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value
Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from
increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and
we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统时间序列预测中信息丢失、固定变量数量限制、可解释性和不确定性分析不足的问题，提升金融时间序列预测的可靠性和实用价值。

Method: 构建FVLDB金融图像文本数据集，开发UARPO不确定性调整组相对策略优化方法，并基于此微调FinZero多模态预训练模型进行推理、预测和分析理解。

Result: FinZero展现出强大的适应性和可扩展性，经过UARPO微调后，在高置信组中相比GPT-4o实现了约13.48%的预测精度提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习微调在多模态大模型中（包括金融时间序列预测任务）具有显著效果，UARPO方法有效提升了预测准确性和不确定性分析能力。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging.
Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it
into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss
of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require
fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the
scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the
uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these
factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To
address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset
(FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization
(UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze
the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal
pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and
analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive
experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability.
After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\%
improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group,
demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in
multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.

TL;DR: 结合生成建模的神经算子方法解决了传统神经算子在湍流模拟中过度平滑的问题，在超分辨率、预测和稀疏重建三个湍流挑战中表现出色，实现了高精度和低计算成本。


<details>

Motivation: 传统神经算子在训练时使用标准L2损失会导致对细尺度湍流结构的过度平滑，无法准确捕捉湍流的精细特征，限制了其在流体力学中的应用。

Method: 提出对抗训练的神经算子(adv-NO)方法，将算子学习与生成建模相结合，通过对抗训练来保持尖锐梯度并准确重建湍流结构。

Result: 在Schlieren射流超分辨率中能量谱误差降低15倍；在3D各向同性湍流中仅用160个时间步就能准确预测5个涡旋翻转时间，推理速度比基线扩散方法快114倍；能够从稀疏PTV输入重建完整的3D速度和压力场。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高精度的重建和预测，计算成本低，为实验和计算流体力学中的近实时分析和控制提供了可能。

Abstract: Neural operators are promising surrogates for dynamical systems but when
trained with standard L2 losses they tend to oversmooth fine-scale turbulent
structures. Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative
modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow
challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal
super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren
jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces
the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural
operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO
trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for
five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than
the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For
reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking
Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity
and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances
enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing
near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and
computational fluid mechanics. See our project page:

Motivation: 现有的kNNImputer方法只能估计缺失值的条件均值，无法捕捉缺失值的分布特征和不确定性，需要一种能够估计条件分布并量化不确定性的方法

Method: kNNSampler方法：对于给定单元的缺失响应，从k个最相似单元（基于观测协变量）的观测响应中随机采样进行插补

Result: 理论证明kNNSampler能够估计缺失响应给定观测协变量的条件分布，实验证明其在恢复缺失值分布方面的有效性

Conclusion: kNNSampler能够采样未知缺失值、量化不确定性、适用于多重插补，相比kNNImputer具有更好的分布估计能力

Abstract: We study a missing-value imputation method, termed kNNSampler, that imputes a
given unit's missing response by randomly sampling from the observed responses
of the $k$ most similar units to the given unit in terms of the observed
covariates. This method can sample unknown missing values from their
distributions, quantify the uncertainties of missing values, and be readily
used for multiple imputation. Unlike popular kNNImputer, which estimates the
conditional mean of a missing response given an observed covariate, kNNSampler
is theoretically shown to estimate the conditional distribution of a missing
response given an observed covariate. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in recovering the distribution of missing values. The code for kNNSampler is
made publicly available (https://github.com/SAP/knn-sampler).

Conclusion: 该方法在原子间势能机器学习材料信息学中具有应用潜力，可避免深度神经网络的需求

Abstract: Recently, a Gaussian Process Regression - neural network (GPRNN) hybrid
machine learning method was proposed, which is based on additive-kernel GPR in
redundant coordinates constructed by rules [J. Phys. Chem. A 127 (2023) 7823].
The method combined the expressive power of an NN with the robustness of linear
regression, in particular, with respect to overfitting when the number of
neurons is increased beyond optimal. We introduce opt-GPRNN, in which the
redundant coordinates of GPRNN are optimized with a Monte Carlo algorithm and
show that when combined with optimization of redundant coordinates, GPRNN
attains the lowest test set error with much fewer terms / neurons and retains
the advantage of avoiding overfitting when the number of neurons is increased
beyond optimal value. The method, opt-GPRNN possesses an expressive power
closer to that of a multilayer NN and could obviate the need for deep NNs in
some applications. With optimized redundant coordinates, a dimensionality
reduction regime is also possible. Examples of application to machine learning
an interatomic potential and materials informatics are given.

Motivation: 多机构EHR数据整合能提高转化研究的可靠性和普适性，但面临数据异构性、语义差异和隐私保护等挑战。

Method: 开发PEHRT管道，包含两个核心模块：(1)数据预处理：将EHR数据映射到标准编码系统；(2)表示学习：使用先进机器学习技术生成研究就绪数据集，无需个体级数据共享。

Abstract: Integrative analysis of multi-institutional Electronic Health Record (EHR)
data enhances the reliability and generalizability of translational research by
leveraging larger, more diverse patient cohorts and incorporating multiple data
modalities. However, harmonizing EHR data across institutions poses major
challenges due to data heterogeneity, semantic differences, and privacy
concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{PEHRT}$, a
standardized pipeline for efficient EHR data harmonization consisting of two
core modules: (1) data pre-processing and (2) representation learning. PEHRT
maps EHR data to standard coding systems and uses advanced machine learning to
generate research-ready datasets without requiring individual-level data
sharing. Our pipeline is also data model agnostic and designed for streamlined
execution across institutions based on our extensive real-world experience. We
provide a complete suite of open source software, accompanied by a
user-friendly tutorial, and demonstrate the utility of PEHRT in a variety of
tasks using data from diverse healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 本文改进了Chen等人(2024)关于非调整Langevin算法偏差的研究，在稀疏交互分布中消除了对数因子，使用相对熵度量距离，并放宽了强对数凹性假设，证明了偏差仅与低维边缘相关而非全维度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非调整Langevin算法在高维采样中存在偏差，传统认为偏差随维度线性增长。但Chen等人发现对于稀疏交互分布，低维边缘的偏差仅与低维度相关，本文旨在强化这一发现并扩展适用范围。

Method: 采用分层分析边际相对熵的方法，受作者最近关于混沌传播工作的启发，对弱交互分布类进行研究。

Result: 成功移除了对数因子，使用相对熵度量距离，放宽了强对数凹性假设，并将去局域化现象扩展到弱交互分布类。

Conclusion: 研究证实了非调整Langevin算法在稀疏和弱交互分布中的去局域化效应，偏差仅与低维度相关，为高维采样提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex
high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias
typically scaling linearly with the dimension when measured in squared
Wasserstein distance. However, the recent paper of Chen et al. (2024)
identifies an intriguing new delocalization effect: For a class of
distributions with sparse interactions, the bias between low-dimensional
marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension. In this
work, we strengthen the results of Chen et al. (2024) in the sparse interaction
regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in relative entropy
(a.k.a. KL-divergence), and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In
addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that
it holds for a class of distributions with weak interactions. Our proofs are
based on a hierarchical analysis of the marginal relative entropies, inspired
by the authors' recent work on propagation of chaos.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce monolithic text that is hard to
edit in parts, which can slow down collaborative workflows. We present
componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular,
independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and
Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent
components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based
Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference
prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based
decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component
manipulation with recomposition.
  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering,
and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with
several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse.
Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1)
a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into
manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3)
preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic
sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for
automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for
turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level
collaboration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前最先进的分类和相似性学习模型在扩展现实(XR)应用中基于用户动作进行身份识别的泛化能力，为XR和元宇宙应用中的用户验证和身份识别提供风险评估。

Method: 开发了一个包含49名用户在5种不同XR应用（4个XR游戏和1个社交XR应用）中运动数据的新数据集，使用该数据集评估两种模型在跨应用场景下的性能和泛化能力。

Result: 模型在同一应用内能够准确识别个体，但在不同XR应用之间的用户识别能力仍然有限，表明当前模型的跨应用泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前运动基用户识别模型在跨应用泛化方面的局限性，为XR和元宇宙应用中的用户身份识别提供了重要的风险评估，并公开了数据集和代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This paper examines the generalization capacity of two state-of-the-art
classification and similarity learning models in reliably identifying users
based on their motions in various Extended Reality (XR) applications. We
developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users
in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action
patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets.
The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the
generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results
indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the
same application, their ability to identify users across different XR
applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current
models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for
user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed
risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and
Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are
made available to the public to encourage similar research on the
generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse
application use cases.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于XML标签的结构化提示方法，通过形式化逻辑框架统一了语法约束解码、分层提示的固定点语义以及人机交互循环，证明了在精炼顺序下XML树的完全格结构和单调算子的最小固定点存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在实际系统中生成可解析、符合模式输出的问题，需要开发一种统一的理论框架来处理结构化提示、语法约束和人机交互协议。

Method: 建立XML树的完全格结构，证明单调提示算子的Knaster-Tarski固定点定理，在任务感知收缩度量下证明Banach式收敛性，结合上下文无关文法的XML模式实现约束解码。

Result: 开发了多层人机交互方案，包括多轮"计划→验证→修订"流程和智能工具使用，保证了输出的良好格式和任务性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化提示提供了完整的数学基础，与语法对齐解码、验证链和程序化提示等最新进展相联系，为实际部署提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Structured prompting with XML tags has emerged as an effective way to steer
large language models (LLMs) toward parseable, schema-adherent outputs in
real-world systems. We develop a logic-first treatment of XML prompting that
unifies (i) grammar-constrained decoding, (ii) fixed-point semantics over
lattices of hierarchical prompts, and (iii) convergent human-AI interaction
loops. We formalize a complete lattice of XML trees under a refinement order
and prove that monotone prompt-to-prompt operators admit least fixed points
(Knaster-Tarski) that characterize steady-state protocols; under a task-aware
contraction metric on trees, we further prove Banach-style convergence of
iterative guidance. We instantiate these results with context-free grammars
(CFGs) for XML schemas and show how constrained decoding guarantees
well-formedness while preserving task performance. A set of multi-layer
human-AI interaction recipes demonstrates practical deployment patterns,
including multi-pass "plan $\to$ verify $\to$ revise" routines and agentic tool
use. We provide mathematically complete proofs and tie our framework to recent
advances in grammar-aligned decoding, chain-of-verification, and programmatic
prompting.

TL;DR: FlexiFlow是一个面向物品级智能的寿命感知设计框架，针对可集成到一次性产品中的柔性电子计算，通过碳足迹建模和优化架构选择，显著降低碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算架构无法适应物品级智能应用的巨大寿命差异（1000倍变化）和万亿级部署规模，需要在kHz速度和有限门数的柔性电子约束下重新思考设计方法。

Method: 框架包含：FlexiBench工作负载套件、FlexiBits面积优化的RISC-V核心（1/4/8位数据路径）、基于部署特性的碳感知模型选择最优架构。

Result: 寿命感知微架构设计可减少1.62倍碳足迹，算法决策可减少14.5倍碳足迹；通过柔性电子PDK流片实现30.9kHz操作。

Conclusion: FlexiFlow推动了极端边缘计算的设计方法革新，需要重新评估传统设计方法以适应新的约束条件。

Abstract: We present FlexiFlow, a lifetime-aware design framework for item-level
intelligence (ILI) where computation is integrated directly into disposable
products like food packaging and medical patches. Our framework leverages
natively flexible electronics which offer significantly lower costs than
silicon but are limited to kHz speeds and several thousands of gates. Our
insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment
patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime,
fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering
trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we
model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon
footprint based on application-specific lifetimes. The framework includes: (1)
FlexiBench, a workload suite targeting sustainability applications from
spoilage detection to health monitoring; (2) FlexiBits, area-optimized RISC-V
cores with 1/4/8-bit datapaths achieving 2.65X to 3.50X better energy
efficiency per workload execution; and (3) a carbon-aware model that selects
optimal architectures based on deployment characteristics. We show that
lifetime-aware microarchitectural design can reduce carbon footprint by 1.62X,
while algorithmic decisions can reduce carbon footprint by 14.5X. We validate
our approach through the first tape-out using a PDK for flexible electronics
with fully open-source tools, achieving 30.9kHz operation. FlexiFlow enables
exploration of computing at the Extreme Edge where conventional design
methodologies must be reevaluated to account for new constraints and
considerations.

Conclusion: 研究证明了大语言模型在种子植入近距离放疗计划自动化中的潜在应用价值

Abstract: Seed implant brachytherapy (SIBT) is an effective cancer treatment modality;
however, clinical planning often relies on manual adjustment of objective
function weights, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal results. This study
proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by
large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated
with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed
weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next
iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after
which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan.
A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed
method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted
approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved
and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target
volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the
potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质语言模型虽然强大，但难以精确控制输出以产生具有特定功能或性质的蛋白质。需要开发新的方法来精确指导蛋白质设计。

Method: 提出简单有效的激活编辑方法，通过编辑激活向量来引导蛋白质语言模型的输出，并开发了新的编辑位点识别模块用于蛋白质优化。

Result: 在溶菌酶样序列生成和优化实验中证明，该方法可以无缝集成到自编码和自回归蛋白质语言模型中，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 激活导向技术为使用基础模型进行精确蛋白质工程提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Protein Language Models (PLMs), pre-trained on extensive evolutionary data
from natural proteins, have emerged as indispensable tools for protein design.
While powerful, PLMs often struggle to produce proteins with precisely
specified functionalities or properties due to inherent challenges in
controlling their outputs. In this work, we investigate the potential of
Activation Steering, a technique originally developed for controlling text
generation in Large Language Models (LLMs), to direct PLMs toward generating
protein sequences with targeted properties. We propose a simple yet effective
method that employs activation editing to steer PLM outputs, and extend this
approach to protein optimization through a novel editing site identification
module. Through comprehensive experiments on lysozyme-like sequence generation
and optimization, we demonstrate that our methods can be seamlessly integrated
into both auto-encoding and autoregressive PLMs without requiring additional
training. These results highlight a promising direction for precise protein
engineering using foundation models.

TL;DR: Igloo是一种多模态抗体环区标记器，通过对比学习编码抗体CDR环区的骨架二面角和序列信息，能够有效检索相似环结构并提升蛋白质基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体CDR环区分类方法覆盖范围有限，且难以整合到蛋白质基础模型中，需要开发新的多模态标记方法来编码抗体环区的多样性。

Method: 使用对比学习训练多模态抗体环区标记器Igloo，编码骨架二面角和序列信息，将相似结构的环映射到潜在空间中相近位置。

Result: Igloo在识别相似H3环方面比现有方法提升5.9%，在10个抗体-抗原靶点中的8个上预测结合亲和力优于基础蛋白质语言模型，与参数量7倍的模型性能相当。

Conclusion: Igloo证明了引入多模态标记对于编码抗体环区多样性、改进蛋白质基础模型以及抗体CDR设计的益处。

Abstract: The complementarity-determining regions of antibodies are loop structures
that are key to their interactions with antigens, and of high importance to the
design of novel biologics. Since the 1980s, categorizing the diversity of CDR
structures into canonical clusters has enabled the identification of key
structural motifs of antibodies. However, existing approaches have limited
coverage and cannot be readily incorporated into protein foundation models.
Here we introduce ImmunoGlobulin LOOp Tokenizer, Igloo, a multimodal antibody
loop tokenizer that encodes backbone dihedral angles and sequence. Igloo is
trained using a contrastive learning objective to map loops with similar
backbone dihedral angles closer together in latent space. Igloo can efficiently
retrieve the closest matching loop structures from a structural antibody
database, outperforming existing methods on identifying similar H3 loops by
5.9\%. Igloo assigns tokens to all loops, addressing the limited coverage issue
of canonical clusters, while retaining the ability to recover canonical loop
conformations. To demonstrate the versatility of Igloo tokens, we show that
they can be incorporated into protein language models with IglooLM and
IglooALM. On predicting binding affinity of heavy chain variants, IglooLM
outperforms the base protein language model on 8 out of 10 antibody-antigen
targets. Additionally, it is on par with existing state-of-the-art
sequence-based and multimodal protein language models, performing comparably to
models with $7\times$ more parameters. IglooALM samples antibody loops which
are diverse in sequence and more consistent in structure than state-of-the-art
antibody inverse folding models. Igloo demonstrates the benefit of introducing
multimodal tokens for antibody loops for encoding the diverse landscape of
antibody loops, improving protein foundation models, and for antibody CDR
design.

Motivation: 移动机器人在复杂未知环境中需要有效的障碍避免能力，以便实现自主导航。

Method: 使用Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D相机获取颜色和深度图像，训练三种绘图神经网络模型，直接生成低级转向命令。

Result: NetConEmb模型在离线评估中达到最低MedAE（中位绝对误差）$0.58\times10^{-3}$ rad/s。在实时导航中，NetConEmb在所有环境中均实现100%成功率。

Conclusion: NetConEmb模型在障碍避免任务中表现最优并具有良好的演进性能，适用于各种环境。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,
achieving a 100\% success rate in both known and unknown environments, while
NetEmb and NetGated succeeded only in navigating the known environment.

Motivation: 传统规划方法依赖预定义距离度量，而安全强化学习在多智能体目标条件场景中表现不佳。现有的图剪枝方法过于保守，限制了任务效率。

Method: 提出RB-CBS扩展方法，动态分配和调整用户指定的风险边界(Δ)，为每个智能体分配局部风险预算(δ)，在保持整体安全约束的同时实现更高效的导航。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种迭代风险分配框架在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，允许多个智能体在用户指定的风险边界内找到无碰撞路径。

Conclusion: RB-CBS通过动态风险预算分配，有效解决了多智能体视觉导航中安全性与效率的权衡问题，为危险环境中的自主系统提供了更好的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

Abstract: Foundation models are revolutionizing autonomous driving perception,
transitioning the field from narrow, task-specific deep learning models to
versatile, general-purpose architectures trained on vast, diverse datasets.
This survey examines how these models address critical challenges in autonomous
perception, including limitations in generalization, scalability, and
robustness to distributional shifts. The survey introduces a novel taxonomy
structured around four essential capabilities for robust performance in dynamic
driving environments: generalized knowledge, spatial understanding,
multi-sensor robustness, and temporal reasoning. For each capability, the
survey elucidates its significance and comprehensively reviews cutting-edge
approaches. Diverging from traditional method-centric surveys, our unique
framework prioritizes conceptual design principles, providing a
capability-driven guide for model development and clearer insights into
foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly
those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time,
scalable systems, and broader deployment challenges related to computational
demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and
out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research
directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in
autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion
estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show
improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues
with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature
extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific
feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving
generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be
found at https://larg.github.io/socialnav-sub .

### [247] [FMT$^{x}$: An Efficient and Asymptotically Optimal Extension of the Fast Marching Tree for Dynamic Replanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08521)
*Soheil Espahbodini Nia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FMT^x是Fast Marching Tree算法的扩展版本，通过在动态环境中实现高效重规划来解决传统FMT*算法无法实时适应环境变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的路径规划是机器人技术的核心挑战，传统FMT*算法在静态环境中提供渐近最优解，但其单次遍历设计无法进行路径修订，而完全重规划计算成本过高。

Method: 重新审视FMT*的邻居选择规则，通过最小化修改克服单次遍历限制，维护成本排序的优先队列，应用选择性更新条件来识别和触发潜在次优路径节点的重新评估。

Result: FMT^x在环境变化后能够恢复渐近最优解，实验结果表明其性能优于RRT^x算法，对动态事件反应更快，计算开销更低。

Conclusion: FMT^x在保持FMT*固有效率的同时实现了对障碍物配置变化的鲁棒适应，为不可预测环境中的实时机器人导航提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.
