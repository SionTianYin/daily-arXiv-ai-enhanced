### [1] [How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628)
*Yusen Wu,Junwu Xiong,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准HSII，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在多用户、多轮社交任务中的能力，并引入了COT-complexity指标以平衡正确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统评估LLMs在复杂社交场景中独立扮演角色的能力，因此需要开发新的基准和方法。

Method: 提出HSII基准，包含四个阶段评估LLMs的社交能力，并引入COT-complexity指标量化效率。

Result: 实验表明HSII能有效评估LLMs的社交技能，COT方法能提升性能但增加计算成本。

Conclusion: HSII为评估LLMs的社交能力提供了有效工具，COT-complexity指标优化了性能与效率的权衡。

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,
instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with
only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently
play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social
settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically
measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an
agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.
Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII
below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social
agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:
format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable
conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion
capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,
HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform
an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'
social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new
statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs
with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between
measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments
demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in
LLMs.

### [2] [Adaptive Token Boundaries: Integrating Human Chunking Mechanisms into Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04637)
*Dongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类认知过程的差异，提出了一种动态跨模态标记化框架，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态信息整合中存在与人类认知的显著差距，研究旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 通过比较人类与模型在视觉-语言任务中的表现，提出动态跨模态标记化框架，包含自适应边界、分层表示和对齐机制。

Result: 新框架在基准任务中显著优于现有模型（VQA提升7.8%，复杂场景描述提升5.3%），且更接近人类认知模式。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更符合人类认知的AI系统提供了理论和实证支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet
significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and
computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research
presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human
cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in
MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with
model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that
conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current
models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human
information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal
tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical
representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science
principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on
benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene
Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention
distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of
the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while
providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI
systems.

### [3] [Language translation, and change of accent for speech-to-speech task using diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639)
*Abhishek Mishra,Ritesh Sur Chowdhury,Vartul Bahuguna,Isha Pandey,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的方法，用于同时进行语音翻译和口音适应，利用扩散模型生成目标语音，优化了传统流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨文化沟通需要同时处理语言翻译和口音适应，但现有研究对此任务关注不足。

Method: 将问题重新定义为条件生成任务，基于音素和目标语音特征生成目标语音，利用扩散模型优化生成过程。

Result: 提出的框架能够联合优化翻译和口音适应，比传统方法更高效且参数更少。

Conclusion: 该方法为语音到语音翻译和口音适应提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural
communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating
content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language
context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current
literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation
task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and
accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of
translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and
effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估Typica.ai的定制模型在检测摩洛哥Darija文化特定毒性内容（如隐晦侮辱、讽刺等）上的表现，并与主流LLM审核API对比。

Method: 使用OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix数据集的平衡测试集，比较Typica.ai模型与OpenAI、Mistral、Anthropic Claude的精度、召回率、F1分数和准确率。

Result: Typica.ai模型表现最佳，突显文化适应模型在内容审核中的优势。

Conclusion: 文化适应模型对可靠内容审核至关重要，尤其在非主流语言中。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative benchmark evaluating the performance of
Typica.ai's custom Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against major
LLM-based moderation APIs: OpenAI (omni-moderation-latest), Mistral
(mistral-moderation-latest), and Anthropic Claude (claude-3-haiku-20240307). We
focus on culturally grounded toxic content, including implicit insults,
sarcasm, and culturally specific aggression often overlooked by general-purpose
systems. Using a balanced test set derived from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset,
we report precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, offering insights into
challenges and opportunities for moderation in underrepresented languages. Our
results highlight Typica.ai's superior performance, underlining the importance
of culturally adapted models for reliable content moderation.

### [5] [Rethinking Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A High-Accuracy, Simplified Fusion Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04642)
*Nischal Mandal,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的多模态情感分析模型，通过简单的特征融合策略实现高效的情感分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析需要整合语言、音频和视觉信号，但现有方法通常过于复杂，本文旨在设计一种轻量且高效的模型。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP数据集，设计模态特定编码器，通过全连接层和dropout正则化提取特征，再通过简单拼接和密集融合层实现跨模态交互。

Result: 模型在六种情感分类任务中达到92%的准确率，性能与复杂模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计的特征工程和模块化设计，简单融合策略在资源受限环境中可优于或匹配复杂模型。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks
to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and
visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention
mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet
effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion
classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned
text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a
modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout
regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using
simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture
cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational
overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful
feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can
outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained
environments.

### [6] [Prediction-powered estimators for finite population statistics in highly imbalanced textual data: Public hate crime estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04643)
*Hannes Waldetoft,Jakob Torgander,Måns Magnusson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Transformer神经网络与调查抽样估计器的方法，用于估计文本数据中的总体参数，减少了手动标注的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限文本数据中估计总体参数时，手动标注目标变量标签具有挑战性。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器神经网络的预测与调查抽样估计器（如Hansen-Hurwitz估计器、差异估计和分层随机抽样估计），将模型预测作为辅助变量。

Result: 在瑞典仇恨犯罪统计数据中验证了方法的适用性，提供了高效的估计结果，减少了手动标注时间。

Conclusion: 若有标注训练数据，该方法可提供高效估计，显著减少手动标注工作量。

Abstract: Estimating population parameters in finite populations of text documents can
be challenging when obtaining the labels for the target variable requires
manual annotation. To address this problem, we combine predictions from a
transformer encoder neural network with well-established survey sampling
estimators using the model predictions as an auxiliary variable. The
applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish
police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's
under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference
estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if
labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very
efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation.

### [7] [ChatGPT for automated grading of short answer questions in mechanical ventilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04645)
*Tejas Jade,Alex Yartsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了ChatGPT 4o在研究生医学教育中自动评分短答案问题的表现，发现其评分与人类评分存在显著差异，尤其是分析性题目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在标准化短答案问题（SAQs）评分中的适用性，以减轻人工评分负担。

Method: 使用ChatGPT 4o对215名学生的557份短答案进行评分，并与人类评分对比，采用多种统计方法分析一致性。

Result: ChatGPT评分系统性低于人类评分，一致性较差（ICC1=0.086，Cohen's kappa=-0.0786），分析性题目分歧最大。

Conclusion: 不建议在高风险评估中使用LLMs自动评分，因其与人类评分差异超过可接受范围。

Abstract: Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in
postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational
language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with
applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We
evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data
from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on
mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based
scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and
rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component
analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's
W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks
than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale.
ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and
Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component
analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value =
0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader.
The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas
checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution
against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of
ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable
boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

Result: 实验显示FRAME显著优于传统方法（如DeepSeek V3提升9.91%），生成论文质量接近人类水平。

Conclusion: FRAME为自动化医学研究论文生成提供了高效且严格的基础。

Abstract: The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs)
presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge
synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent
Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation
through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises
three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that
decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through
iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,
Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality
through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework
that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements
over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with
DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation
dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve
quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in
synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work
could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for
automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic
standards.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，包括新颖性生成、多模态符号整合和伦理保障，强调LLMs在科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific hypothesis
generation and validation by enabling information synthesis, latent
relationship discovery, and reasoning augmentation. This survey provides a
structured overview of LLM-driven approaches, including symbolic frameworks,
generative models, hybrid systems, and multi-agent architectures. We examine
techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge-graph completion,
simulation, causal inference, and tool-assisted reasoning, highlighting
trade-offs in interpretability, novelty, and domain alignment. We contrast
early symbolic discovery systems (e.g., BACON, KEKADA) with modern LLM
pipelines that leverage in-context learning and domain adaptation via
fine-tuning, retrieval, and symbolic grounding. For validation, we review
simulation, human-AI collaboration, causal modeling, and uncertainty
quantification, emphasizing iterative assessment in open-world contexts. The
survey maps datasets across biomedicine, materials science, environmental
science, and social science, introducing new resources like AHTech and
CSKG-600. Finally, we outline a roadmap emphasizing novelty-aware generation,
multimodal-symbolic integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and ethical
safeguards, positioning LLMs as agents for principled, scalable scientific
discovery.

TL;DR: AMIE（Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer）通过多模态数据处理能力提升了诊断对话性能，在模拟研究中表现优于初级保健医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs评估多限于纯语言交互，而实际远程医疗需要多模态数据处理能力。

Method: 利用Gemini 2.0 Flash实现状态感知对话框架，动态控制对话流，并通过患者状态不确定性引导后续问题。

Result: AMIE在105个模拟场景中，在多模态和非多模态评估轴上均显著优于初级保健医生。

Conclusion: 多模态对话诊断AI取得进展，但实际应用仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting
diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to
language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of
remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and
patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in
medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while
preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains
unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management
performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a
new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this
precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system
implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is
dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states
and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by
uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal
history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE
to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of
chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation
scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of
clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric
assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like
history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and
empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9
multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The
results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but
real-world translation needs further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI和LLMs的快速发展，其伦理问题（如安全、滥用和歧视）日益突出，需系统评估和监管。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-V3、GPT系列和Gemini等模型的伦理表现，引入RDC指标量化危害。

Result: 不同模型在伦理表现上存在显著差异，RDC为评估危害提供了新工具。

Conclusion: 需加强人类监督，尤其是在高风险场景，RDC可作为伦理评估的有效补充。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly
evolved in recent years, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these advancements also raise critical
ethical questions regarding safety, potential misuse, discrimination and
overall societal impact. This article provides a comparative analysis of the
ethical performance of various AI models, including the brand new
DeepSeek-V3(R1 with reasoning and without), various GPT variants (4o, 3.5
Turbo, 4 Turbo, o1/o3 mini) and Gemini (1.5 flash, 2.0 flash and 2.0 flash exp)
and highlights the need for robust human oversight, especially in situations
with high stakes. Furthermore, we present a new metric for calculating harm in
LLMs called Relative Danger Coefficient (RDC).

### [12] [Integration of Large Language Models and Traditional Deep Learning for Social Determinants of Health Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04655)
*Paul Landes,Jimeng Sun,Adam Cross*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合传统深度学习和大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法，自动从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），并在公开数据集上展示了其优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDoH对健康状态有重要影响，但传统方法效率低，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合传统深度学习和LLMs，提出了一种更高效且精确的分类方法。

Result: 模型在SDoH多标签分类上比基准提高了10分，且执行时间缩短了12倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为SDoH的自动预测提供了高效且精确的解决方案，适用于高风险患者。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are economic, social and personal
circumstances that affect or influence an individual's health status. SDoHs
have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to
physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we
automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning
and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of
each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a
previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and
we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X
execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present
combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the
LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also
show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data
and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models
and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that
impact at-risk patients.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成合成跌倒数据以解决真实数据稀缺的问题，评估了多种模型在模拟跌倒场景中的表现，并分析了合成数据对跌倒检测性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实跌倒数据（尤其是老年人数据）稀缺，训练跌倒检测系统面临挑战。

Method: 使用文本到运动（T2M, SATO, ParCo）和文本到文本（GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini）模型生成合成数据，并与真实数据集结合，通过LSTM模型评估其对跌倒检测性能的影响。还比较了LLM生成数据与扩散方法生成数据的分布一致性。

Result: 合成数据的有效性受数据集特性影响，LLM生成数据在低频（20Hz）表现最佳，但在高频（200Hz）不稳定。扩散方法生成的数据与真实数据最接近，但未显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据的有效性取决于传感器位置和跌倒表示方式，研究为优化跌倒检测模型的合成数据生成提供了见解。

Abstract: Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of
real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this,
we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and
text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall
scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four
real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection
performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we
compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate
their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that
dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic
data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g.,
20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While
text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than
text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based
synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not
consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that
the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall
representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data
generation for fall detection models.

Result: 实验表明，BERT模型能有效提升广告点击率和转化率，同时通过隐私保护机制降低数据泄露风险。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在广告推荐中具有潜力，但需结合隐私保护技术以确保实际应用的安全性。

Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for
personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in
actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with
measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area
worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized
risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital
advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model
(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer
architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural
language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an
algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor
risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,
feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT
for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user
portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure
the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper
designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a
large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The
experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively
improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the
same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the
risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用检索增强生成（RAG）技术构建问答系统，以解决建筑规范查询的复杂性问题，重点优化了检索器和语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑规范内容复杂且更新频繁，手动查询效率低下，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用RAG技术，评估不同检索方法（如Elasticsearch）和语言模型微调的效果。

Result: Elasticsearch是最优检索器，微调语言模型能显著提升回答的相关性。

Conclusion: 结合高效检索器和微调语言模型的RAG系统能有效应对建筑规范的查询挑战。

Abstract: Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design,
construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire
protection, and accessibility. They are often extensive, complex, and subject
to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key
difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical
language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A
potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers
user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a
QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG
consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study
focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and
optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning
techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by
performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and
explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models
using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative
assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and
fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of
language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results
showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The
findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific
dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.
When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like
Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,
enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward-SQL框架通过引入Process Reward Models（PRMs）提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，采用分阶段策略（冷启动后PRM监督）和四种集成方法，显著提高了模型准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PRMs能增强Text-to-SQL任务的推理能力，但滥用可能导致推理轨迹扭曲和错误SQL生成。因此，需要系统研究如何有效整合PRMs。

Method: 提出Reward-SQL框架，分两阶段：1）冷启动阶段，训练模型分解SQL查询为结构化推理链（Chain-of-CTEs）；2）探索四种PRM集成策略，发现GRPO与PRM引导推理结合效果最佳。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，Reward-SQL使7B PRM监督的模型性能提升13.1%，基于Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的GRPO策略模型达到68.9%准确率，优于同类基线。

Conclusion: Reward-SQL通过奖励监督有效提升了Text-to-SQL推理性能，证明了PRMs在任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning
capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external
Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to
provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the
reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To
address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically
explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process
effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision"
paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into
structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions
(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.
Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that
combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference
(e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD
benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1%
performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned
policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the
BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model
size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging
reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全评估框架无法应对VLLMs在复杂多模态和多轮对话中的安全与伦理挑战，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入REVEAL框架，包括自动图像挖掘、合成对抗数据生成、多轮对话扩展和全面危害评估。

Result: 评估了五种VLLMs，发现多轮对话缺陷率更高，GPT-4o表现最佳，Llama-3.2缺陷率最高。

Conclusion: REVEAL框架有效识别VLLMs的安全漏洞，多轮对话和错误信息是未来改进重点。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with
textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding
application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel
safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn
conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for
text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these
complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible
Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated
pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated
image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational
expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment
through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2,
Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual
harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn
interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to
single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably,
GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our
Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally,
misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual
defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while
Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

Abstract: This paper presents a thoroughly automated method for identifying and
interpreting cuneiform characters via advanced deep-learning algorithms. Five
distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of
cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics,
including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding
performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the
Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively
recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise
English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking
approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve
detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic
relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic,
emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the
capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging
computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant
insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.

Conclusion: 该研究为优化领域专用LLM提供了一种全流程方法，平衡了通用能力和领域专业性。

Abstract: This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large
language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs),
where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity
that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of
original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain
performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a
1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that
domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving
1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work
introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs,
bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific
expertise.

Result: 发现唐宋时期花卉意象情感内涵的显著变化，并揭示文学表达与艺术表现的新协同关系。

Conclusion: 研究为计算人文与传统汉学的结合提供了新视角，揭示了文学与艺术的深层联系。

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an
extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs
served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While
previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic
correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment
analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song
poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in
decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational
humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By
applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in
classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between
the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with
visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing
previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic
representation.

Method: 构建扰动多跳QA数据集并诱导幻觉，通过监督微调7B模型进行检测。

Result: 7B模型在RAGTruth基准测试中召回率优于GPT-4o，且在精度和准确率上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 该方法以更少参数实现了高效幻觉检测，为RAG系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption
by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However,
hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided
context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production
environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human
evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for
hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from
scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work,
we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via
supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model
than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer
competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction
of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

Result: FaithJudge显著提升了LLM幻觉评估的准确性，并推出了新的幻觉排行榜。

Conclusion: FaithJudge为LLM幻觉评估提供了更可靠的基准，有助于推动RAG中的幻觉问题研究。

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce
hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided
context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or
contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations
with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce
hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM
hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model
(HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great
research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current
hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods
on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose
FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination
annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination
evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination
leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination
leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in
RAG.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational
tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique
linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study
presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question
answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset
of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased
questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a
combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted
generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model
fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model
that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking
and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course
syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into
course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that
both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model
narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as
OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable,
domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for
educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as
academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning
management system (LMS) integrations.

Motivation: 探究CoT在LLMs中的内部机制，尤其是其在复杂推理任务中的作用。

Method: 通过多位数乘法和动态规划任务，分析CoT令牌的作用，包括保留中间结果和干预值。

Result: 仅保留中间结果令牌即可达到类似性能；CoT令牌可能类似变量，但存在计算复杂度限制。

Conclusion: CoT令牌的功能类似程序变量，但需注意其潜在缺陷，如计算复杂度和捷径问题。

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate
intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven
effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner
mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically
study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit
multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving
these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate
results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that
storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect
model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice
that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly.
These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer
programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and
computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Result: 假设在句法结构中不成立，且难以推广到儿童语言和动物信号。

Conclusion: 需重新评估幂律与层次结构的关系，假设不成立。

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively
investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power
laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the
universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of
correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical
structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been
extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument
supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this
problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic
structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse
trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English
corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as
in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the
assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to
apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting
the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical
structures.

Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法依赖奖励函数，忽视了人类偏好的复杂性和多面性，尤其是在不同任务和人群中可能存在冲突因素。

Method: 引入Latent Preference Coding (LPC)框架，自动从数据中推断隐含因素及其重要性，无需预定义奖励函数或手工组合权重。

Result: 实验表明，LPC在多个基准测试中显著提升了三种对齐算法（DPO、SimPO、IPO）的性能，并增强了对抗数据噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LPC为多样化偏好因素提供了统一表示，为开发更鲁棒和通用的对齐技术铺平了道路，有助于负责任地部署大型语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning
their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward
function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human
preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and
populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding
(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their
combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC
seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically
inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying
on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves
upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models
(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis
reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in
the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness
of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for
the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more
robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of
powerful LLMs.

Result: InvICL在多数基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，展示了更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: InvICL是一种有效的ICL算法，解决了顺序敏感性问题，并提升了性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of
auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual
independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several
variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of
these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing
methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a
methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two
properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous
models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在群体推荐系统（GRS）中的应用条件，特别是零样本学习和提示格式对准确性的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析组复杂性（用户和物品数量）、不同LLMs、提示条件（如上下文学习）和偏好格式对性能的影响。

Result: 性能在超过100个评分时下降，但不同LLMs对复杂性敏感度不同；上下文学习能显著提升高复杂性下的性能。

Conclusion: 未来研究应考虑组复杂性对LLM性能的影响，且小模型在适当条件下也能有效生成群体推荐。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems
aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems
(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single
recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies
correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the
group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the
impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,
different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller
models that require less computing power and costs.

Result: 实验验证了EK-FAC的扩展性和多阶段影响函数的有效性，并通过案例展示了其解释能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解微调后LLM的预测提供了新工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during
pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their
pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been
proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data.
However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack
scalability to billion-scale LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the
downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the
full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality
of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected
Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation.
Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and
the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case
studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power,
with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence
estimates. Our code is public at

### [30] [G-FOCUS: Towards a Robust Method for Assessing UI Design Persuasiveness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05026)
*Jaehyun Jeon,Janghan Yoon,Minsoo Kim,Sumin Shim,Yejin Choi,Hanbin Kim,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出WiserUI-Bench基准和G-FOCUS推理策略，用于评估UI设计的说服力，旨在替代或补充耗时费力的A/B测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B测试成本高且耗时，现有视觉语言模型（VLM）方法未能有效评估UI设计的比较说服力。

Method: 引入WiserUI-Bench基准（包含300个UI图像对及A/B测试结果），并提出G-FOCUS推理策略以减少位置偏差并提高评估准确性。

Result: G-FOCUS在一致性和准确性上优于现有推理策略，适用于成对UI评估。

Conclusion: 该工作为UI设计优化提供了可扩展的VLM驱动方法，有望补充A/B测试。

Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics
to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B
testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive
higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current
approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative
persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,
we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design
Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled
with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,
a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based
persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference
strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through
promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an
approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI
preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released
publicly.

Twitter posts in Latvian along with their manual translations into English. We
compare our results to previous work and show that the more recently released
vision-language model checkpoints are becoming increasingly capable at this
task, but there is still much room for further improvement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言，其健康查询常含冗余信息，需高效摘要以提供精准医疗响应。

Method: 使用BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集（2,350对查询-摘要）和ROUGE指标，比较九种LLMs与微调模型Bangla T5的性能。

Result: Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct在ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L中表现最佳，Bangla T5在ROUGE-2中领先，零样本LLMs可媲美微调模型。

Conclusion: 零样本LLMs在低资源语言任务中潜力显著，为医疗查询摘要提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer Health Queries (CHQs) in Bengali (Bangla), a low-resource language,
often contain extraneous details, complicating efficient medical responses.
This study investigates the zero-shot performance of nine advanced large
language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Llama3-70b-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct, Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Qwen2-72b-Instruct, Gemma-2-27b, and Athene-70B, in summarizing Bangla CHQs.
Using the BanglaCHQ-Summ dataset comprising 2,350 annotated query-summary
pairs, we benchmarked these LLMs using ROUGE metrics against Bangla T5, a
fine-tuned state-of-the-art model. Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct emerged as the top
performing model in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, while Bangla T5 excelled in ROUGE-2.
The results demonstrate that zero-shot LLMs can rival fine-tuned models,
achieving high-quality summaries even without task-specific training. This work
underscores the potential of LLMs in addressing challenges in low-resource
languages, providing scalable solutions for healthcare query summarization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多尺度共形预测（MCP）的零样本机器生成文本检测框架，以解决高误报率（FPR）问题，同时提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对恶意滥用的担忧，现有检测方法过于关注准确率而忽视了高FPR的社会风险。

Method: 利用共形预测（CP）约束FPR上限，并通过多尺度共形预测（MCP）框架克服性能下降问题，同时引入高质量数据集RealDet。

Result: MCP有效约束FPR，显著提升检测性能，并增强了对对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCP框架在约束FPR和提升检测性能方面表现出色，为机器生成文本检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant
concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,
developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical
priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on
detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false
positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal
Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While
directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction
in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a
Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal
Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection
performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that
spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling
superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances
detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks
across multiple detectors and datasets.

*Boyi Deng,Yu Wan,Yidan Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）多语言能力的机制，提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的新方法，通过分解激活特征来分析语言特异性，并展示了如何利用这些特征控制模型的语言生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经元或内部激活的方法在多语言分析中存在叠加和层间激活差异等问题，限制了可靠性，因此需要更精细的分析工具。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解LLMs的激活特征，提出了一种新指标评估特征的单语言性，并通过特征消融实验验证其语言特异性。

Result: 发现某些SAE特征与特定语言强相关，消融这些特征仅显著影响一种语言能力；还发现某些语言存在协同特征，联合消融效果更显著。此外，利用这些特征改进了控制语言生成的导向向量。

Conclusion: SAEs为分析LLMs的多语言能力提供了更可靠的方法，语言特异性特征的发现为模型控制和优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based
methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and
layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the
activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We
introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from
SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific
languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only
significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost
unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE
features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating
individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific
features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language
generated by LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决乌尔都语等低资源语言在MNER研究中缺乏标注数据集和标准化基线的问题。

Method: 结合Urdu-BERT和ResNet提取文本与视觉特征，通过跨模态融合模块对齐信息。

Result: 在Twitter2015-Urdu数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: 为低资源语言的MNER研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social
media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an
increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.
Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains
underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges
include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of
standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER
framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for
Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated
with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by
evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing
comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER
framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text
embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion
Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further
MNER research in low-resource languages.

TL;DR: QualBench是首个专注于中文大语言模型（LLM）本地化评估的多领域问答基准，包含17,000多个问题，覆盖六个垂直领域。Qwen2.5模型表现优于GPT-4o，凸显本地化领域知识的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在垂直领域覆盖不足，且缺乏对中国工作场景的针对性评估，需构建更贴合中国政策和行业标准的评估框架。

Method: 利用资格考试作为统一框架，构建QualBench数据集，涵盖六领域17,000+问题，基于24项中国资格考试设计。

Result: Qwen2.5表现优于GPT-4o，中文LLM整体优于非中文模型，最佳准确率为75.26%，显示模型领域覆盖仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLM与众包机制协作失败，未来可通过多领域RAG知识增强和联邦学习优化垂直领域LLM训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the
need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However,
existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited
insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a
unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the
first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of
Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical
domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely
align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive
evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with
Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the
importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements.
The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage
within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM
collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for
multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with
Federated Learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉词间关系时依赖复杂模块，而Transformer的语义建模能力未被充分利用。直接使用Transformer面临长序列和局部注意力不公平的挑战。

Method: 提出T-T方法，结合条纹注意力机制和循环移位策略，优化全局注意力为局部窗口，并促进窗口间交互。

Result: 实验表明，T-T在计算成本更低的情况下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T-T通过高效的关系学习模块，显著提升了ASTE任务的性能，为Transformer在表格标注任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed
of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences.
The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the
tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention
mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local
attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different
attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art
performance with lower computational costs.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在支持辩论过程中存在不足，需要设计更符合辩论理论的技术。

Result: 理想技术设计应体现辩论基本原则，促进批判性思维。

Abstract: In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖计算昂贵的梯度或人工启发式，未能充分利用数据内在属性。

Result: 实验表明，ICon在15%数据选择下优于全数据集5.42%，且比其他方法高2.06%。

Conclusion: ICon选择的数据兼具任务多样性和适当难度，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost.
However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally
expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may
fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we
propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel
gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of
in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient
computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally
efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive
bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components
and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under
implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12
benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data
outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of
widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze
high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and
appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

Method: 分析现成和微调后的LLM生成的新闻内容中的框架表现，比较不同模型架构的框架倾向。

Result: LLM在敏感话题中表现出比人类更明显的框架偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异显著。

Conclusion: 需开发后训练缓解策略和更严格的评估框架，以确保自动化新闻内容的平衡性。

Abstract: Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively
emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large
language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing
concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases
compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in
both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis
reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs
tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In
addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across
different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher
biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation
strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news
content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

Motivation: 探讨英语为中心的推理微调在多语言环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 通过扩展推理计算和长链思维（CoTs）策略，研究模型在多语言数学推理中的表现。

Result: 模型在高资源语言中表现更优，但在低资源语言和跨领域任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 建议在高资源语言中使用英语为中心的模型，同时需进一步改进低资源语言和跨领域推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for
English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we
investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that
scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models
(RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages
including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models
twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are
naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think
pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an
effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we
observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource
languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in
particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.
Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the
limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time
scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason
in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning
in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

Motivation: 研究CoT是否能忠实反映AI模型的真实推理过程，以评估其在AI安全监控中的潜力。

Method: 测试了6种推理提示下先进推理模型的CoT忠实性，并研究了基于结果的强化学习对忠实性的影响。

Result: CoT揭示提示使用的比例通常低于20%；强化学习初期提升忠实性但随后停滞；提示使用频率增加时，其言语化并未同步提升。

Conclusion: CoT监控在训练和评估中有潜力，但无法完全避免罕见或灾难性行为，尤其在CoT非必要场景中效果有限。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows
monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning
processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs
faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT
faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints
presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,
CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the
hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement
learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and
(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward
hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without
training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a
promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,
but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring
of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected
behaviors.

Result: TransProQA在相关性（ACC-EQ和Kendall's tau）和充分性评估中显著优于现有指标，接近人类评估水平。

Conclusion: TransProQA具有广泛适用性，可作为文学评估的无训练指标，尤其适用于需要本地处理的文本。

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary
domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy
over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being
superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this
bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural
authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary
evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based
question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary
translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from
professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical
elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural
understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while
literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially
outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ
and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by
over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator
insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of
translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation
performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad
applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b,
indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation
metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing
due to copyright or ethical considerations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的数据过滤管道，通过引入快速验证策略和优化种子数据选择，显著提升了数据质量和训练效率，并应用于Ultra-FineWeb数据集的构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的发展，数据质量成为提升模型性能的关键因素。然而，现有方法在数据验证效率和种子数据选择上存在不足。

Method: 提出快速验证策略评估数据对LLM训练的影响，优化种子数据选择，并构建基于fastText的轻量级分类器，形成高效数据过滤管道。

Result: 应用于FineWeb和Chinese FineWeb数据集，构建了高质量的Ultra-FineWeb数据集，显著提升了LLM在多个基准任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的数据过滤管道有效提升了数据质量和训练效率，验证了其在LLM训练中的实用性。

Abstract: Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering
has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.
However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data
verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data
quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks
clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of
subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient
verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on
LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,
we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM
training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize
the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data
filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,
classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental
and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we
employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the
filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese
FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb
dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120
billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on
Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple
benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both
data quality and training efficiency.

Result: 通过重新评估现有系统和集成新系统，提供了架构、规模和提示策略对性能的影响的实用见解。

Conclusion: clem todd为构建高效对话AI系统提供了实用指导，增强了评估的一致性和灵活性。

Abstract: The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

Elections in 2019 and 2024. We also benchmark Pre-trained and Large Language
Models (focusing on GPT-4o), studying their effectiveness in detecting
election-related misleading narratives. Finally, we discuss potential use cases
and make recommendations for future research directions using the proposed
codebook and dataset.

Method: 提出跨模态模型合并方法，将LLM的推理能力融入VLM，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明模型合并成功转移推理能力，感知能力集中于早期层，推理能力分布于中后期层。合并后所有层均参与推理，感知分布不变。

Conclusion: 模型合并为多模态整合与解释提供了新工具，揭示了感知与推理的分布机制。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general
capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain
poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning
through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike
previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose
merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities
from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged
models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how
merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly
encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely
facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all
layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception
abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed
light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration
and interpretation.

Motivation: 直接对齐方法在大型语言模型与人类偏好对齐中存在冗长和似然位移问题，尤其是噪声偏好对会导致偏好与非偏好响应的似然相似。

Method: 提出基于比较预言机的偏好对齐方法，提供其基本方案的收敛保证，并通过启发式方法改进，实验验证其灵活性和兼容性。

Result: 在多个基准模型和评测集上实验表明，该方法能有效解决现有直接对齐方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 设计针对不同似然边际的偏好对的专门方法具有重要意义，补充了近期研究结果。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the
issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the
noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and
dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and
provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our
method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the
flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance
of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple
base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with
benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show
the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations
of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we
evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs
with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in
\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

TL;DR: Histo-Miner是一个基于深度学习的管道，用于分析皮肤全切片图像（WSI），并生成两个标注数据集（细胞核和肿瘤区域）。它在皮肤鳞状细胞癌（cSCC）分析中表现优异，并可用于预测患者对免疫治疗的反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对皮肤组织的标注数据集和开源分析管道，限制了数字病理学的发展。

Method: 利用卷积神经网络和视觉变换器，对细胞核进行分割和分类，并对肿瘤区域进行分割。生成的特征向量可用于下游任务。

Result: 模型性能优异：细胞核分割mPQ为0.569，分类F1为0.832，肿瘤分割mIoU为0.884。预测特征可用于免疫治疗反应预测。

Conclusion: Histo-Miner在临床相关场景中具有应用潜力，为分类提供直接解释并揭示生物学机制。

Abstract: Recent advancements in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analysis
of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution
microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, there is a
lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for
analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based
pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled
nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient
samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma
skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell
nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients,
Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for
nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation.
Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with
multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation,
macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection
over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these
predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology
and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks.
Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy
based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies
percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor
vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as
predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of
Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation
of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.

Method: 比较了六种跟踪器（两种点跟踪器和四种关节跟踪器）与专家手动标注的结果，提出后处理模块用于异常检测和角度融合预测。

Result: 关节模型的均方根误差为11.41°至4.37°，结合后处理模块后可降至6.99°和3.88°。

Conclusion: 姿态跟踪器在短跑生物力学分析中具有潜力，但高精度应用仍需改进。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years,
mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a
vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have
led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in
sports analysis and performance evaluation.
  This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and
four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed
framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the
manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The
experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners,
focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip
flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module
for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.
  The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields
root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When
integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to
6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that
human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical
analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in
applications where high accuracy is required.

Conclusion: LayouSyn为开放词汇场景布局生成提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在图像编辑中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout
generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods
are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for
open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader
applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use
lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text
prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in
an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning
benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we
show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly
combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a
pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn
in image editing applications.

Abstract: Performance comparisons are fundamental in medical imaging Artificial
Intelligence (AI) research, often driving claims of superiority based on
relative improvements in common performance metrics. However, such claims
frequently rely solely on empirical mean performance. In this paper, we
investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of
the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We
quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that
leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to
estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by
chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims
outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a
high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification
papers and 53% of segmentation papers. These findings highlight a critical flaw
in current benchmarking practices: claims of outperformance in medical imaging
AI are frequently unsubstantiated, posing a risk of misdirecting future
research efforts.

Abstract: This study addresses the inherent limitations of Multi-Layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) in Vision Transformers (ViTs) by introducing Hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (KAN)-ViT (Hyb-KAN ViT), a novel framework that integrates
wavelet-based spectral decomposition and spline-optimized activation functions,
prior work has failed to focus on the prebuilt modularity of the ViT
architecture and integration of edge detection capabilities of Wavelet
functions. We propose two key modules: Efficient-KAN (Eff-KAN), which replaces
MLP layers with spline functions and Wavelet-KAN (Wav-KAN), leveraging
orthogonal wavelet transforms for multi-resolution feature extraction. These
modules are systematically integrated in ViT encoder layers and classification
heads to enhance spatial-frequency modeling while mitigating computational
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K (Image Recognition), COCO (Object
Detection and Instance Segmentation), and ADE20K (Semantic Segmentation)
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with Hyb-KAN ViT. Ablation studies
validate the efficacy of wavelet-driven spectral priors in segmentation and
spline-based efficiency in detection tasks. The framework establishes a new
paradigm for balancing parameter efficiency and multi-scale representation in
vision architectures.

<details>

Motivation: 现有RGB-D方法在追求高精度时牺牲效率，而轻量级方法难以达到高精度，需平衡两者。

Method: 引入Depth Anything Model提升深度图质量；提出DAM模块解耦模态特征；开发DIRM模块扩展特征空间；设计DFAM模块聚合特征。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上超越SOTA CNN模型，参数仅5.2M，速度达415 FPS。

Conclusion: SATNet成功平衡效率与性能，为轻量级RGB-D SOD提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current RGB-D methods usually leverage large-scale backbones to improve
accuracy but sacrifice efficiency. Meanwhile, several existing lightweight
methods are difficult to achieve high-precision performance. To balance the
efficiency and performance, we propose a Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff Network
(SATNet) for Lightweight RGB-D SOD from three fundamental perspectives: depth
quality, modality fusion, and feature representation. Concerning depth quality,
we introduce the Depth Anything Model to generate high-quality depth maps,which
effectively alleviates the multi-modal gaps in the current datasets. For
modality fusion, we propose a Decoupled Attention Module (DAM) to explore the
consistency within and between modalities. Here, the multi-modal features are
decoupled into dual-view feature vectors to project discriminable information
of feature maps. For feature representation, we develop a Dual Information
Representation Module (DIRM) with a bi-directional inverted framework to
enlarge the limited feature space generated by the lightweight backbones. DIRM
models texture features and saliency features to enrich feature space, and
employ two-way prediction heads to optimal its parameters through a
bi-directional backpropagation. Finally, we design a Dual Feature Aggregation
Module (DFAM) in the decoder to aggregate texture and saliency features.
Extensive experiments on five public RGB-D SOD datasets indicate that the
proposed SATNet excels state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based heavyweight models and
achieves a lightweight framework with 5.2 M parameters and 415 FPS.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models mark a transformative advancement in
artificial intelligence, aiming to unify perception, natural language
understanding, and embodied action within a single computational framework.
This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent
advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across
five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving
field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems,
tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist
agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners,
and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature
review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three
years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations,
parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations.
We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous
vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented
reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across
real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability,
generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the
state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI
adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic
planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where
VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive,
and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational

Motivation: 解决神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，利用无标签和合成标签数据提升知识保留能力。

Method: 结合聚类级不确定性反馈机制和VLM驱动的生成回放模块，动态调整阈值并生成代表性合成数据。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等数据集上达到98.13%等SOTA性能，超越现有方法4.36%。

Conclusion: R2R框架在无监督持续学习中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data
while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating
``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel
uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative
Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture
efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced
proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a
VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods
that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates
without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data
and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled
with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along
with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data
representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that
replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental
analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and
TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,
achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,
59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

Conclusion: GlobustVP首次通过凸松弛技术实现了消失点估计的高效全局最优解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental
task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP
association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either
sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of
computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation
techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a
``soft'' association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error,
that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations.
This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a
quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then
relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP
problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative
solver (called \textbf{GlobustVP}), which independently searches for one VP and
its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After
each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three
VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that
\textbf{GlobustVP} achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness,
and global optimality compared to previous works. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobustVP.

TL;DR: DetReIDX是一个大规模的空地行人数据集，旨在测试真实世界条件下行人重识别（ReID）的性能，包含多会话、多视角和复杂变化的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID技术在真实世界复杂条件下表现不佳，公开数据集未能充分体现极端数据变化，限制了技术进步。

Method: 创建DetReIDX数据集，包含13百万边界框、509个身份，覆盖多会话、多地点、多高度（5.8-120米）及16种软生物特征标注。

Result: SOTA方法在DetReIDX条件下性能显著下降（检测准确率降80%，Rank-1 ReID降70%）。

Conclusion: DetReIDX为真实世界ReID研究提供了挑战性基准，数据集和评估协议已公开。

Abstract: Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform
relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down
when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to
extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale
variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts.
Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate
such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this
technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person
dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world
conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million
bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from
three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More
important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two
sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location,
making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were
annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection,
tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence
of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and
ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in
detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs
conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are
publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models are widely used in real-world applications but
remain vulnerable to distribution shifts, especially due to weather and
lighting changes. Collecting diverse real-world data for testing the robustness
of DL models is resource-intensive, making synthetic corruptions an attractive
alternative for robustness testing. However, are synthetic corruptions a
reliable proxy for real-world corruptions? To answer this, we conduct the
largest benchmarking study on semantic segmentation models, comparing
performance on real-world corruptions and synthetic corruptions datasets. Our
results reveal a strong correlation in mean performance, supporting the use of
synthetic corruptions for robustness evaluation. We further analyze
corruption-specific correlations, providing key insights to understand when
synthetic corruptions succeed in representing real-world corruptions.

Conclusion: ORXE为多样化实际部署提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents ORXE, a modular and adaptable framework for achieving
real-time configurable efficiency in AI models. By leveraging a collection of
pre-trained experts with diverse computational costs and performance levels,
ORXE dynamically adjusts inference pathways based on the complexity of input
samples. Unlike conventional approaches that require complex metamodel

the development process. The proposed system utilizes a confidence-based gating
mechanism to allocate appropriate computational resources for each input. ORXE
also supports adjustments to the preference between inference cost and
prediction performance across a wide range during runtime. We implemented a
training-free ORXE system for image classification tasks, evaluating its
efficiency and accuracy across various devices. The results demonstrate that
ORXE achieves superior performance compared to individual experts and other
dynamic models in most cases. This approach can be extended to other
applications, providing a scalable solution for diverse real-world deployment
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM的高计算和内存需求限制了其在资源受限设备上的部署，现有固定位宽量化方法在精度和效率上表现不佳。

Method: 提出基于KL散度的层重要性评分和基于因果互信息的层间协同指标，通过整数二次规划（IQP）优化位宽分配。

Result: 在6位和4位混合精度设置下，Mix-QSAM在实例分割和对象检测任务中平均精度提升达20%。

Conclusion: Mix-QSAM显著提升了SAM在量化后的性能，为资源受限设备提供了可行的部署方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a popular vision foundation model;
however, its high computational and memory demands make deployment on
resource-constrained devices challenging. While Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ) is a practical approach for reducing computational overhead, existing PTQ
methods rely on fixed bit-width quantization, leading to suboptimal accuracy
and efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose Mix-QSAM, a
mixed-precision PTQ framework for SAM. First, we introduce a layer-wise
importance score, derived using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, to quantify
each layer's contribution to the model's output. Second, we introduce
cross-layer synergy, a novel metric based on causal mutual information, to
capture dependencies between adjacent layers. This ensures that highly
interdependent layers maintain similar bit-widths, preventing abrupt precision
mismatches that degrade feature propagation and numerical stability. Using
these metrics, we formulate an Integer Quadratic Programming (IQP) problem to
determine optimal bit-width allocation under model size and bit-operation
constraints, assigning higher precision to critical layers while minimizing
bit-width in less influential layers. Experimental results demonstrate that
Mix-QSAM consistently outperforms existing PTQ methods on instance segmentation
and object detection tasks, achieving up to 20% higher average precision under
6-bit and 4-bit mixed-precision settings, while maintaining computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法在特征稀疏区域、极端尺度和视场差异以及大变形情况下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: ART利用多尺度特征和自回归框架，通过随机采样点和交叉注意力层逐步细化变换。

Result: 实验表明，ART在多种数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ART是一种强大的图像对齐方法，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving
feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large
deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these
challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field
while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We
thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that
iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an
auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our
network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each
scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model
focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging,
feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad
applicability.

Motivation: 现有MPQ方法需要在大规模数据集上进行昂贵的搜索，计算成本高。

Method: 在小数据集上搜索量化策略，结合锐度感知最小化、隐式梯度方向对齐和自适应扰动半径技术。

Result: 在CIFAR10上搜索策略后，在ImageNet上达到相同精度，计算成本显著降低，效率提升150%。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了量化过程，提高了效率，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for
optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.
Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a
computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale
datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first
searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them
to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the
need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model
weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:
sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit
gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different
optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate
optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our
approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training
data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a
significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to
150% over the baselines.

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DFDC数据集上，性能分别提升5%和7%。

Conclusion: 新方法在跨数据集评估中优于现有技术，为深度伪造检测提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a
spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their
realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement
authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels
of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within
society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are
struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation.
This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which
limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat
the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that
leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their
interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy
of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement
strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature
disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without
adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation.
Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design
choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art
methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a
cross-dataset evaluation setting.

Result: 在CT和MRI数据集上，OWT在图像重建和分割任务中表现优异，并支持语义级生成和检索。

Conclusion: OWT为语义解耦表示学习提供了基础框架，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning often rely on holistic, black-box
embeddings that entangle multiple semantic components, limiting
interpretability and generalization. These issues are especially critical in
medical imaging. To address these limitations, we propose an Organ-Wise
Tokenization (OWT) framework with a Token Group-based Reconstruction (TGR)
training paradigm. Unlike conventional approaches that produce holistic
features, OWT explicitly disentangles an image into separable token groups,
each corresponding to a distinct organ or semantic entity. Our design ensures
each token group encapsulates organ-specific information, boosting
interpretability, generalization, and efficiency while allowing fine-grained
control in downstream tasks. Experiments on CT and MRI datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of OWT in not only achieving strong image reconstruction and
segmentation performance, but also enabling novel semantic-level generation and
retrieval applications that are out of reach for standard holistic embedding
methods. These findings underscore the potential of OWT as a foundational
framework for semantically disentangled representation learning, offering broad
scalability and applicability to real-world medical imaging scenarios and
beyond.

Method: 提出Pro2SAM网络，结合GTFormer生成粗粒度前景图作为掩码提示，并通过密集网格点提示SAM生成前景掩码，最后通过像素级相似度匹配确定定位图。

Conclusion: Pro2SAM通过SAM的零样本能力和细粒度分割能力，显著提升了WSOL的性能。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects
by only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its
low annotation cost in real applications. Current studies focus on the Class
Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to
identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can
not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which
hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively
leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained
segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of
integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue
accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt
to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a
Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map
as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and
novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid
points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground
mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt.
Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask
matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is
viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed
Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC,
with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: GlyphMastero通过跨层次和多尺度融合，显著提升了场景文本编辑的性能。

Abstract: Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in
images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the
surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in
text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These
methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly
when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters
are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must
be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder
designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with
stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using
pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical
nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level
interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph
encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between
local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel
glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid
network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level.
Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed
glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation
process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over
the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while
simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by
53.28\%.

Abstract: Infrared object tracking plays a crucial role in Anti-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(Anti-UAV) applications. Existing trackers often depend on cropped template
regions and have limited motion modeling capabilities, which pose challenges
when dealing with tiny targets. To address this, we propose a simple yet
effective infrared tiny-object tracker that enhances tracking performance by
integrating global detection and motion-aware learning with temporal priors.
Our method is based on object detection and achieves significant improvements
through two key innovations. First, we introduce frame dynamics, leveraging
frame difference and optical flow to encode both prior target features and
motion characteristics at the input level, enabling the model to better
distinguish the target from background clutter. Second, we propose a trajectory
constraint filtering strategy in the post-processing stage, utilizing
spatio-temporal priors to suppress false positives and enhance tracking
robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches across multiple metrics in challenging infrared UAV
tracking scenarios. Notably, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in the 4th
Anti-UAV Challenge, securing 1st place in Track 1 and 2nd place in Track 2.

Abstract: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in

Abstract: Palmprint recognition is a secure and privacy-friendly method of biometric
identification. One of the major challenges to improve palmprint recognition
accuracy is the scarcity of palmprint data. Recently, a popular line of
research revolves around the synthesis of virtual palmprints for large-scale
pre-training purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel synthesis method named
Canny2Palm that extracts palm textures with Canny edge detector and uses them
to condition a Pix2Pix network for realistic palmprint generation. By
re-assembling palmprint textures from different identities, we are able to
create new identities by seeding the generator with new assemblies. Canny2Palm
not only synthesizes realistic data following the distribution of real
palmprints but also enables controllable diversity to generate large-scale new
identities. On open-set palmprint recognition benchmarks, models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm synthetic data outperform the state-of-the-art with up to 7.2%
higher identification accuracy. Moreover, the performance of models pre-trained
with Canny2Palm continues to improve given 10,000 synthetic IDs while those
with existing methods already saturate, demonstrating the potential of our
method for large-scale pre-training.

Motivation: 现有可变形医学图像配准模型在并行提取粗粒度和细粒度特征方面效率不足，FF-PNet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了残差特征融合模块（RFFM）用于粗粒度特征提取，残差变形场融合模块（RDFFM）用于细粒度图像变形，两者并行操作。

Result: 在LPBA和OASIS数据集上的实验表明，FF-PNet在Dice相似系数等指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FF-PNet通过RFFM和RDFFM的并行操作，无需注意力机制或多层感知器，即可显著提升配准精度。

Abstract: In recent years, deformable medical image registration techniques have made
significant progress. However, existing models still lack efficiency in
parallel extraction of coarse and fine-grained features. To address this, we
construct a new pyramid registration network based on feature and deformation
field (FF-PNet). For coarse-grained feature extraction, we design a Residual
Feature Fusion Module (RFFM), for fine-grained image deformation, we propose a
Residual Deformation Field Fusion Module (RDFFM). Through the parallel
operation of these two modules, the model can effectively handle complex image
deformations. It is worth emphasizing that the encoding stage of FF-PNet only
employs traditional convolutional neural networks without any attention
mechanisms or multilayer perceptrons, yet it still achieves remarkable
improvements in registration accuracy, fully demonstrating the superior feature
decoding capabilities of RFFM and RDFFM. We conducted extensive experiments on
the LPBA and OASIS datasets. The results show our network consistently
outperforms popular methods in metrics like the Dice Similarity Coefficient.

Conclusion: 该方法通过建筑物引导的伪标签学习显著提升了建筑物损坏评估的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate building damage assessment using bi-temporal multi-modal remote
sensing images is essential for effective disaster response and recovery
planning. This study proposes a novel Building-Guided Pseudo-Label Learning
Framework to address the challenges of mapping building damage from
pre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR images. First, we train a series of
building extraction models using pre-disaster optical images and building
labels. To enhance building segmentation, we employ multi-model fusion and
test-time augmentation strategies to generate pseudo-probabilities, followed by
a low-uncertainty pseudo-label training method for further refinement. Next, a
change detection model is trained on bi-temporal cross-modal images and damaged
building labels. To improve damage classification accuracy, we introduce a
building-guided low-uncertainty pseudo-label refinement strategy, which
leverages building priors from the previous step to guide pseudo-label
generation for damaged buildings, reducing uncertainty and enhancing
reliability. Experimental results on the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieved the
highest mIoU score (54.28%) and secured first place in the competition.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale
pretraining, text-to-video generation has achieved unprecedented capabilities
in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range
of styles, enabling applications in advertising, entertainment, and education.
However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as
captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant
challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we
introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to
evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video
models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene
changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across

solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate
legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current
video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at
enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.

Abstract: The proposed system outlined in this paper is a solution to a use case that
requires the autonomous picking of cuboidal objects from an organized or
unorganized pile with high precision. This paper presents an efficient method
for precise pose estimation of cuboid-shaped objects, which aims to reduce
errors in target pose in a time-efficient manner. Typical pose estimation
methods like global point cloud registrations are prone to minor pose errors
for which local registration algorithms are generally used to improve pose
accuracy. However, due to the execution time overhead and uncertainty in the
error of the final achieved pose, an alternate, linear time approach is
proposed for pose error estimation and correction. This paper presents an
overview of the solution followed by a detailed description of individual
modules of the proposed algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像合成中因标注数据有限、模态差异和复杂病理特征导致的解剖保真度和病理准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：预训练阶段使用EWC保留解剖结构，微调阶段使用LoRA模块控制病理严重程度；通过Tweedie公式实现一步采样。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MFID为17.01，比现有方法低28%，并提升分割性能3.8% mDSC；生成的图像在临床评估中与真实扫描难以区分。

Conclusion: ViCTr首次实现细粒度病理感知的MRI合成，填补了AI医学影像研究的关键空白。

Abstract: Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated
pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing
diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to
maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features,
frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient
multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency
Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow
trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity,
pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k
dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical
anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By
reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr
supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without
sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and
CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for
cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet
segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews
indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically
indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method
to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity
control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉造影（CAG）是评估冠状动脉疾病的金标准，但其解读和治疗规划高度依赖专家。研究旨在通过AI提供决策支持，减轻专家负担。

Method: 1. 从539例检查中采样14,686帧图像，标注关键帧和左右侧性，训练ConvNeXt-Base CNN。2. 应用CNN提取1,114关键帧，结合报告和专家验证数据，微调三种开源VLM（PaliGemma2、Gemma3、ConceptCLIP-enhanced Gemma3）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过微调的VLM能有效辅助临床报告生成和治疗建议，为CAG图像分析提供了AI支持。

Abstract: Coronary angiography (CAG) is the gold-standard imaging modality for
evaluating coronary artery disease, but its interpretation and subsequent
treatment planning rely heavily on expert cardiologists. To enable AI-based
decision support, we introduce a two-stage, physician-curated pipeline and a
bilingual (Japanese/English) CAG image-report dataset. First, we sample 14,686
frames from 539 exams and annotate them for key-frame detection and left/right
laterality; a ConvNeXt-Base CNN trained on this data achieves 0.96 F1 on
laterality classification, even on low-contrast frames. Second, we apply the
CNN to 243 independent exams, extract 1,114 key frames, and pair each with its
pre-procedure report and expert-validated diagnostic and treatment summary,
yielding a parallel corpus. We then fine-tune three open-source VLMs
(PaliGemma2, Gemma3, and ConceptCLIP-enhanced Gemma3) via LoRA and evaluate
them using VLScore and cardiologist review. Although PaliGemma2 w/LoRA attains
the highest VLScore, Gemma3 w/LoRA achieves the top clinician rating (mean
7.20/10); we designate this best-performing model as CAG-VLM. These results
demonstrate that specialized, fine-tuned VLMs can effectively assist
cardiologists in generating clinical reports and treatment recommendations from
CAG images.

Motivation: 智能代理通过自然语言理解和交互3D环境对机器人和人机交互至关重要，但现有方法在视觉和文本语义上存在不足。

Method: DenseGrounding结合了Hierarchical Scene Semantic Enhancer（增强视觉语义）和Language Semantic Enhancer（增强文本语义），利用大语言模型提供丰富上下文。

Result: 实验表明，DenseGrounding在整体准确率上显著优于现有方法，并在CVPR 2024竞赛中获奖。

Conclusion: DenseGrounding通过多模态语义增强，有效提升了3D视觉定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Enabling intelligent agents to comprehend and interact with 3D environments
through natural language is crucial for advancing robotics and human-computer
interaction. A fundamental task in this field is ego-centric 3D visual
grounding, where agents locate target objects in real-world 3D spaces based on
verbal descriptions. However, this task faces two significant challenges: (1)
loss of fine-grained visual semantics due to sparse fusion of point clouds with
ego-centric multi-view images, (2) limited textual semantic context due to
arbitrary language descriptions. We propose DenseGrounding, a novel approach
designed to address these issues by enhancing both visual and textual
semantics. For visual features, we introduce the Hierarchical Scene Semantic
Enhancer, which retains dense semantics by capturing fine-grained global scene
features and facilitating cross-modal alignment. For text descriptions, we
propose a Language Semantic Enhancer that leverages large language models to
provide rich context and diverse language descriptions with additional context
during model training. Extensive experiments show that DenseGrounding
significantly outperforms existing methods in overall accuracy, with
improvements of 5.81% and 7.56% when trained on the comprehensive full dataset
and smaller mini subset, respectively, further advancing the SOTA in egocentric
3D visual grounding. Our method also achieves 1st place and receives the
Innovation Award in the CVPR 2024 Autonomous Grand Challenge Multi-view 3D
Visual Grounding Track, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

Method: 提出BiHumanML3D数据集和BiMD模型，结合Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign)方法优化生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了文本与动作的对齐性和动作质量。

Conclusion: BiHumanML3D和BiMD模型为双语文本到动作生成提供了有效解决方案，ReAlign方法进一步优化了生成质量。

Abstract: Bilingual text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from
bilingual text inputs, holds immense potential for cross-linguistic
applications in gaming, film, and robotics. However, this task faces critical
challenges: the absence of bilingual motion-language datasets and the
misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, leading
to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address these
challenges, we propose BiHumanML3D, a novel bilingual human motion dataset,
which establishes a crucial benchmark for bilingual text-to-motion generation
models. Furthermore, we propose a Bilingual Motion Diffusion model (BiMD),
which leverages cross-lingual aligned representations to capture semantics,
thereby achieving a unified bilingual model. Building upon this, we propose
Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign) method, comprising a step-aware
reward model to assess alignment quality during sampling and a reward-guided
strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned
distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a
text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for
realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density
and alignment. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves
text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods. Project page: https://wengwanjiang.github.io/ReAlign-page/.

Result: 在2个基准数据集上，FedDDL平均Top-1准确率比现有方法高4.5%。

Conclusion: FedDDL有效消除混杂路径，提升模型对主要对象的关注能力。

Abstract: Attribute bias in federated learning (FL) typically leads local models to
optimize inconsistently due to the learning of non-causal associations,
resulting degraded performance. Existing methods either use data augmentation
for increasing sample diversity or knowledge distillation for learning
invariant representations to address this problem. However, they lack a
comprehensive analysis of the inference paths, and the interference from
confounding factors limits their performance. To address these limitations, we
propose the \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}econfounding and
\underline{D}ebiasing \underline{L}earning (FedDDL) method. It constructs a
structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs
backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an
intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to
decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that
establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the
model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an
inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce
the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges
the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical
regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate
that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main
objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over
9 state-of-the-art existing methods.

Result: StabStitch++在拼接性能、鲁棒性和效率上优于现有方法，支持实时在线视频拼接。

Conclusion: StabStitch++通过同时优化对齐和稳定性，显著提升了视频拼接质量，推动了该领域的进展。

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which
unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when
extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are
stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and
affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a
novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal
stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from
existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image
to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image
planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable
bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation
and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens
and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in
video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching
trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal
warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched
videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,
trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that
sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and
optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To
establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a
video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.
Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching
performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in
this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

Abstract: Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar
transitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually
assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to
automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology
quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for
rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models
(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative
algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,
showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show
that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs
-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,
p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first
centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially
visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating
stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public
use.

Abstract: Accurate online map matching is fundamental to vehicle navigation and the
activation of intelligent driving functions. Current online map matching
methods are prone to errors in complex road networks, especially in multilevel
road area. To address this challenge, we propose an online Standard Definition
(SD) map matching method by constructing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with
multiple probability factors. Our proposed method can achieve accurate map
matching even in complex road networks by carefully leveraging lane markings
and scenario recognition in the designing of the probability factors. First,
the lane markings are generated by a multi-lane tracking method and associated
with the SD map using HMM to build an enriched SD map. In areas covered by the
enriched SD map, the vehicle can re-localize itself by performing Iterative
Closest Point (ICP) registration for the lane markings. Then, the probability
factor accounting for the lane marking detection can be obtained using the
association probability between adjacent lanes and roads. Second, the driving
scenario recognition model is applied to generate the emission probability
factor of scenario recognition, which improves the performance of map matching
on elevated roads and ordinary urban roads underneath them. We validate our
method through extensive road tests in Europe and China, and the experimental
results show that our proposed method effectively improves the online map
matching accuracy as compared to other existing methods, especially in
multilevel road area. Specifically, the experiments show that our proposed
method achieves $F_1$ scores of 98.04% and 94.60% on the Zenseact Open Dataset
and test data of multilevel road areas in Shanghai respectively, significantly
outperforming benchmark methods. The implementation is available at

Abstract: In controlled blasting operations, accurately detecting densely distributed
tiny boreholes from far-view imagery is critical for operational safety and
efficiency. However, existing detection methods often struggle due to small
object scales, highly dense arrangements, and limited distinctive visual
features of boreholes. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive
detection approach that builds upon existing architectures (e.g., YOLO) by
explicitly leveraging consistent embedding representations derived through
exponential moving average (EMA)-based statistical updates.
  Our method introduces three synergistic components: (1) adaptive augmentation
utilizing dynamically updated image statistics to robustly handle illumination
and texture variations; (2) embedding stabilization to ensure consistent and
reliable feature extraction; and (3) contextual refinement leveraging spatial
context for improved detection accuracy. The pervasive use of EMA in our method
is particularly advantageous given the limited visual complexity and small
scale of boreholes, allowing stable and robust representation learning even
under challenging visual conditions. Experiments on a challenging proprietary
quarry-site dataset demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline
YOLO-based architectures, highlighting our method's effectiveness in realistic
and complex industrial scenarios.

Conclusion: SOAP在单视角头像建模和图像到3D生成方面表现出色，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Creating animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains challenging due to
style limitations (realistic, cartoon, anime) and difficulties in handling
accessories or hairstyles. While 3D diffusion models advance single-view
reconstruction for general objects, outputs often lack animation controls or
suffer from artifacts because of the domain gap. We propose SOAP, a
style-omniscient framework to generate rigged, topology-consistent avatars from
any portrait. Our method leverages a multiview diffusion model trained on 24K
3D heads with multiple styles and an adaptive optimization pipeline to deform
the FLAME mesh while maintaining topology and rigging via differentiable
rendering. The resulting textured avatars support FACS-based animation,
integrate with eyeballs and teeth, and preserve details like braided hair or
accessories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method
over state-of-the-art techniques for both single-view head modeling and
diffusion-based generation of Image-to-3D. Our code and data are publicly
available for research purposes at https://github.com/TingtingLiao/soap.

Motivation: 现有基于查询的分割方法在零样本语义分割中因缺乏对未见类别的监督而表现不佳，匈牙利匹配容易将未见类别误分类为背景。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SM策略有效解决了零样本语义分割中的未见类别分类问题，并通过多尺度特征增强提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not
annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has
achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due
to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully
supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS,
as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However,
conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks,
needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background
in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a
novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two
components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent
classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates).
Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling
each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To
discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo
masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then
conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity
and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature
Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual
multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial
details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian
matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个鲁棒且可靠的系统，用于实时分析自然环境下（in-the-wild）的面部表情行为，目前仍面临两大挑战：缺乏大规模标注数据集和高效特征提取困难。

Method: 提出xTrace工具，利用最大规模的面部情感视频数据集（约45万视频）训练模型，并设计可解释且高效的面部情感描述符。

Result: 在5万视频的验证集上，xTrace达到0.86的平均CCC和0.13的平均绝对误差，表现优于现有工具。

Conclusion: xTrace能高精度识别2D情感空间中多数情绪，对非正面头部姿态具有鲁棒性，且其不确定性估计与准确性高度相关。

Abstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge
in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it
still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for
naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time.
This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The
paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive
coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial
video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and
computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce
xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting
continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from
in-the-wild face videos.
  To address challenge (1), our affect recognition model is trained on the
largest facial affect video data set, containing ~450k videos that cover most
emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile
in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address
challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only
explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with
low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked
against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox.
On an in-the-wild validation set composed of 50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86
mean CCC and 0.13 mean absolute error values. We present a detailed error
analysis of affect predictions from xTrace, illustrating (a). its ability to
recognise emotions with high accuracy across most bins in the 2D emotion space,
(b). its robustness to non-frontal head pose angles, and (c). a strong
correlation between its uncertainty estimates and its accuracy.

Conclusion: USAM是一种计算成本低、易用的不确定性量化方法，适用于用户提示、半监督流程及平衡精度与成本效率。

Abstract: The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for
numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the
uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of
the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty
quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated
uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation
jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task
uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ
method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised
models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic
USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k,
DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ
alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines,
or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.

Result: FFT性能下降，LP和LFT对尾部类别效果有限；ULFine显著降低训练成本并提升准确性。

Conclusion: ULFine通过自适应拟合和互补融合，有效解决了长尾半监督学习中的偏差问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Based on the success of large-scale visual foundation models like CLIP in
various downstream tasks, this paper initially attempts to explore their impact
on Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) by employing the foundation
model with three strategies: Linear Probing (LP), Lightweight Fine-Tuning
(LFT), and Full Fine-Tuning (FFT). Our analysis presents the following
insights: i) Compared to LTSSL algorithms trained from scratch, FFT results in
a decline in model performance, whereas LP and LFT, although boosting overall
model performance, exhibit negligible benefits to tail classes. ii) LP produces
numerous false pseudo-labels due to \textit{underlearned} training data, while
LFT can reduce the number of these false labels but becomes overconfident about
them owing to \textit{biased fitting} training data. This exacerbates the
pseudo-labeled and classifier biases inherent in LTSSL, limiting performance
improvement in the tail classes. With these insights, we propose a Unbiased
Lightweight Fine-tuning strategy, \textbf{ULFine}, which mitigates the
overconfidence via confidence-aware adaptive fitting of textual prototypes and
counteracts the pseudo-labeled and classifier biases via complementary fusion
of dual logits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ULFine markedly
decreases training costs by over ten times and substantially increases
prediction accuracies compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks
such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with
fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions.
To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances
fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage
large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for
capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is
constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding
boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich
representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are
incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic
differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original
CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks,
including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection,
image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results
highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and
improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are

Abstract: Human-robot interaction for assistive technologies relies on the prediction
of affordances, which are the potential actions a robot can perform on objects.
Predicting object affordances from visual perception is formulated differently
for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance
segmentation, and hand-object interaction synthesis. In this work, we highlight
the reproducibility issue in these redefinitions, making comparative benchmarks
unfair and unreliable. To address this problem, we propose a unified
formulation for visual affordance prediction, provide a comprehensive and
systematic review of previous works highlighting strengths and limitations of
methods and datasets, and analyse what challenges reproducibility. To favour
transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document to detail the
proposed solution, the datasets, and the validation. As the physical properties
of an object influence the interaction with the robot, we present a generic
framework that links visual affordance prediction to the physical world. Using
the weight of an object as an example for this framework, we discuss how
estimating object mass can affect the affordance prediction. Our approach
bridges the gap between affordance perception and robot actuation, and accounts
for the complete information about objects of interest and how the robot
interacts with them to accomplish its task.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating
the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image.
Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works
adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to
represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity
information and background information. As a result, the generated images not
only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly
reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+
space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a
more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through
multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and
background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate
identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between
identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based
diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named
PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning
strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature
extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff
through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space,
which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed
cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the
identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild
images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to capture continuous motion information
over time and space, making them well-suited for optical flow estimation.
However, most existing learning-based methods for event-based optical flow
adopt frame-based techniques, ignoring the spatio-temporal characteristics of
events. Additionally, these methods assume linear motion between consecutive
events within the loss time window, which increases optical flow errors in
long-time sequences. In this work, we observe that rich spatio-temporal
information and accurate nonlinear motion between events are crucial for
event-based optical flow estimation. Therefore, we propose E-NMSTFlow, a novel
unsupervised event-based optical flow network focusing on long-time sequences.
We propose a Spatio-Temporal Motion Feature Aware (STMFA) module and an
Adaptive Motion Feature Enhancement (AMFE) module, both of which utilize rich
spatio-temporal information to learn spatio-temporal data associations.
Meanwhile, we propose a nonlinear motion compensation loss that utilizes the
accurate nonlinear motion between events to improve the unsupervised learning
of our network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. Remarkably, our method ranks first among
unsupervised learning methods on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets. Our project

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has surpassed human performance on standard benchmarks,
driving its widespread adoption in computer vision tasks. One such task is
disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in
stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like
medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity
estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and
generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating
the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering
progress in the field.
  To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking
tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation
methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions
such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common
Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We
conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity
estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy,
reliability, and generalization. Open-source code for DispBench:

Result: 实验表明MDE-Edit在编辑准确性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MDE-Edit为复杂多目标图像编辑任务提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex
scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant
challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1)
Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment,
leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where
color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to
cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color
bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these
challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from
attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based
methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to
feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations,
we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables
precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named
MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via
two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention
with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency
Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing
leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and
coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality,
offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.

Method: 利用内窥镜光照衰减效应分割和跟踪气道，构建3D模型测量狭窄程度。

Result: 方法首次实现自动化评估，结果与CT和专家评估一致，具有可重复性。

Conclusion: 该方法可辅助诊断，减少检查时间和辐射，并发布了首个公开数据集。

Abstract: Purpose: Subglottic stenosis refers to the narrowing of the subglottis, the
airway between the vocal cords and the trachea. Its severity is typically
evaluated by estimating the percentage of obstructed airway. This estimation
can be obtained from CT data or through visual inspection by experts exploring
the region. However, visual inspections are inherently subjective, leading to
less consistent and robust diagnoses. No public methods or datasets are
currently available for automated evaluation of this condition from
bronchoscopy video.
  Methods: We propose a pipeline for automated subglottic stenosis severity
estimation during the bronchoscopy exploration, without requiring the physician
to traverse the stenosed region. Our approach exploits the physical effect of
illumination decline in endoscopy to segment and track the lumen and obtain a
3D model of the airway. This 3D model is obtained from a single frame and is
used to measure the airway narrowing.
  Results: Our pipeline is the first to enable automated and robust subglottic
stenosis severity measurement using bronchoscopy images. The results show
consistency with ground-truth estimations from CT scans and expert estimations,
and reliable repeatability across multiple estimations on the same patient. Our
evaluation is performed on our new Subglottic Stenosis Dataset of real
bronchoscopy procedures data.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate how to automate evaluation of subglottic stenosis
severity using only bronchoscopy. Our approach can assist with and shorten
diagnosis and monitoring procedures, with automated and repeatable estimations
and less exploration time, and save radiation exposure to patients as no CT is
required. Additionally, we release the first public benchmark for subglottic
stenosis severity assessment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn joint representations by mapping images
and text into a shared latent space. However, recent research highlights that
deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the
uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions
and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing
approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM
training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful
representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper,
we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings
from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
(GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text
inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal
embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained,
the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic
embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty
calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval,
visual question answering, and active learning.

Abstract: The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,
especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot
engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and
firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources
often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image
quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.
In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object
detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when
exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a
significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect
objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be
exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving
assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,
"manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors
(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle
lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental
factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their
performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To
mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to
enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated
emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster
RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by
0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by
0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of
between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.

*Wei Peng,Kang Liu,Jianchen Hu,Meng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Biomed-DPT是一种知识增强的双模态提示调优技术，通过结合文本和视觉提示，优化了生物医学图像分类任务，在少样本场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示学习方法多仅使用文本提示，忽视了生物医学图像的特殊结构（如复杂解剖结构和细微病理特征）。

Method: Biomed-DPT设计了双模态提示：文本提示包括模板驱动的临床提示和LLM驱动的领域适应提示，并通过知识蒸馏提取临床知识；视觉提示引入零向量作为软提示，利用注意力重加权避免关注非诊断区域和非关键病理特征。

Result: 在11个生物医学图像数据集上平均分类准确率达66.14%，在基类和新增类中分别达到78.06%和75.97%，优于CoOp方法。

Conclusion: Biomed-DPT通过双模态提示和知识增强，显著提升了生物医学图像分类性能，尤其在少样本场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image
classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt
learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular
structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological
features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a
knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text
prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven
clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted
prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts
through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,
Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention
re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of
non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average
classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering
9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes
and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method
by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively. Our code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练的T2I扩散模型指导盲超分辨率（BSR）已成为主流方法，但传统U-Net架构性能有限，DiT表现出更高潜力。

Method: 提出EAM方法，结合Ψ-DiT块（三流架构）和渐进式掩码图像建模策略，并采用多模态模型生成主题感知提示。

Result: EAM在多个数据集上取得最先进结果，定量指标和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAM通过DiT和优化策略显著提升了BSR性能，为图像恢复领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Utilizing pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models to guide Blind
Super-Resolution (BSR) has become a predominant approach in the field. While
T2I models have traditionally relied on U-Net architectures, recent
advancements have demonstrated that Diffusion Transformers (DiT) achieve
significantly higher performance in this domain. In this work, we introduce
Enhancing Anything Model (EAM), a novel BSR method that leverages DiT and
outperforms previous U-Net-based approaches. We introduce a novel block,
$\Psi$-DiT, which effectively guides the DiT to enhance image restoration. This
block employs a low-resolution latent as a separable flow injection control,
forming a triple-flow architecture that effectively leverages the prior
knowledge embedded in the pre-trained DiT. To fully exploit the prior guidance
capabilities of T2I models and enhance their generalization in BSR, we
introduce a progressive Masked Image Modeling strategy, which also reduces
training costs. Additionally, we propose a subject-aware prompt generation
strategy that employs a robust multi-modal model in an in-context learning
framework. This strategy automatically identifies key image areas, provides
detailed descriptions, and optimizes the utilization of T2I diffusion priors.
Our experiments demonstrate that EAM achieves state-of-the-art results across
multiple datasets, outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics
and visual quality.

Abstract: Efficient view planning is a fundamental challenge in computer vision and
robotic perception, critical for tasks ranging from search and rescue
operations to autonomous navigation. While classical approaches, including
sampling-based and deterministic methods, have shown promise in planning camera
viewpoints for scene exploration, they often struggle with computational
scalability and solution optimality in complex settings. This study introduces
HQC-NBV, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for view planning that leverages
quantum properties to efficiently explore the parameter space while maintaining
robustness and scalability. We propose a specific Hamiltonian formulation with
multi-component cost terms and a parameter-centric variational ansatz with
bidirectional alternating entanglement patterns that capture the hierarchical
dependencies between viewpoint parameters. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that quantum-specific components provide measurable performance
advantages. Compared to the classical methods, our approach achieves up to
49.2% higher exploration efficiency across diverse environments. Our analysis
of entanglement architecture and coherence-preserving terms provides insights
into the mechanisms of quantum advantage in robotic exploration tasks. This
work represents a significant advancement in integrating quantum computing into
robotic perception systems, offering a paradigm-shifting solution for various
robot vision tasks.

Conclusion: 强调在创造性领域应用多模态系统时，需提升其可解释性。

Abstract: CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images
and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it "see" the same
way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we
investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic
information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated
imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene
understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual
deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing
CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its
alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings
reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations,
particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further
discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance
mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based
image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in
multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance
and subjectivity play a central role.

Conclusion: PADriver为个性化自动驾驶提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PADriver, a novel closed-loop framework for
personalized autonomous driving (PAD). Built upon Multi-modal Large Language
Model (MLLM), PADriver takes streaming frames and personalized textual prompts
as inputs. It autoaggressively performs scene understanding, danger level

closed-loop benchmark named PAD-Highway based on Highway-Env simulator to
comprehensively evaluate the decision performance under traffic rules. The
dataset contains 250 hours videos with high-quality annotation to facilitate
the development of PAD behavior analysis. Experimental results on the

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D
Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual
prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is
to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared
with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,
this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple
valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and
free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation
protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as
well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that
this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of
benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

Conclusion: PRE-Mamba在多种雨天条件下表现优越，且适用于不同雨强、视角及雪天场景。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high temporal resolution and dynamic range but suffer
from dense noise in rainy conditions. Existing event deraining methods face
trade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel
point-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the
spatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces
a 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to
preserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion
module (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling
and interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State
Space Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and
multi-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by
frequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95
SR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a
comprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences.
Moreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities,

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains
challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and
irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep
learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and
satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate
a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by
deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index
(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a
Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.
We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical
learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource
usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall
accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and
optimized training strategies for robust building segmentation in remote

Result: 通过图像指标证明，加入丑陋图像可改变或逆转图像特征与美学评价的关系。

Conclusion: 现有美学研究可能因数据偏斜而放大、低估或遗漏重要效应，需更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: While it is easy for human observers to judge an image as beautiful or ugly,
aesthetic decisions result from a combination of entangled perceptual and
cognitive (semantic) factors, making the understanding of aesthetic judgements
particularly challenging from a scientific point of view. Furthermore, our
research shows a prevailing bias in current databases, which include mostly
beautiful images, further complicating the study and prediction of aesthetic
responses. We address these limitations by creating a database of images with
minimal semantic content and devising, and next exploiting, a method to
generate images on the ugly side of aesthetic valuations. The resulting Minimum
Semantic Content (MSC) database consists of a large and balanced collection of
10,426 images, each evaluated by 100 observers. We next use established image
metrics to demonstrate how augmenting an image set biased towards beautiful
images with ugly images can modify, or even invert, an observed relationship
between image features and aesthetics valuation. Taken together, our study
reveals that works in empirical aesthetics attempting to link image content and
aesthetic judgements may magnify, underestimate, or simply miss interesting
effects due to a limitation of the range of aesthetic values they consider.

Conclusion: ProgIP方法在减少硬件复杂度的同时，实现了高精度的实时全身姿态估计。

Abstract: The motion capture system that supports full-body virtual representation is
of key significance for virtual reality. Compared to vision-based systems,
full-body pose estimation from sparse tracking signals is not limited by
environmental conditions or recording range. However, previous works either
face the challenge of wearing additional sensors on the pelvis and lower-body
or rely on external visual sensors to obtain global positions of key joints. To
improve the practicality of the technology for virtual reality applications, we
estimate full-body poses using only inertial data obtained from three Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors worn on the head and wrists, thereby reducing
the complexity of the hardware system. In this work, we propose a method called
Progressive Inertial Poser (ProgIP) for human pose estimation, which combines
neural network estimation with a human dynamics model, considers the
hierarchical structure of the kinematic chain, and employs a multi-stage
progressive network estimation with increased depth to reconstruct full-body
motion in real time. The encoder combines Transformer Encoder and bidirectional
LSTM (TE-biLSTM) to flexibly capture the temporal dependencies of the inertial
sequence, while the decoder based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) transforms
high-dimensional features and accurately projects them onto Skinned
Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model parameters. Quantitative and qualitative
experimental results on multiple public datasets show that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with the same inputs, and is comparable to
recent works using six IMU sensors.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models demonstrate strong multimodal alignment
and generalization across diverse tasks. Among them, CLIP stands out as one of
the most successful approaches. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP
to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates
without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into
tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings.
These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual
features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a
contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that
alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our
method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects.
We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware
audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance
alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our
method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves
strong generalization in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: TokLIP为自回归Transformer提供了高效的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a
foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training
computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of
high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer
that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and
incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal
autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level
discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level
continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize
high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension
and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers
without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results
demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual
tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level
generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in
both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at

Abstract: We propose a novel joint framework by integrating super-resolution and

directly from freely available Sentinel-2 imagery. JointSeg was trained on
multimodal cross-resolution inputs, offering a scalable and affordable
alternative to traditional approaches. This synergistic design enables gradual

textures, and ensures high classification fidelity through effective
cross-scale feature fusion. This method has been successfully applied to the
Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), a region characterized by complex
urban-rural patterns and diverse topography. As a result, a comprehensive ISA
mapping product for 2021, referred to as ISA-1, was generated, covering an area
of over 2.2 million square kilometers. Quantitative comparisons against the 10m
ESA WorldCover and other benchmark products reveal that ISA-1 achieves an
F1-score of 85.71%, outperforming bilinear-interpolation-based segmentation by
9.5%, and surpassing other ISA datasets by 21.43%-61.07%. In densely urbanized
areas (e.g., Suzhou, Nanjing), ISA-1 reduces ISA overestimation through
improved discrimination of green spaces and water bodies. Conversely, in
mountainous regions (e.g., Ganzi, Zhaotong), it identifies significantly more
ISA due to its enhanced ability to detect fragmented anthropogenic features
such as rural roads and sparse settlements, demonstrating its robustness across
diverse landscapes. Moreover, we present biennial ISA maps from 2017 to 2023,
capturing spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics across representative cities.
The results highlight distinct regional growth patterns: rapid expansion in
upstream cities, moderate growth in midstream regions, and saturation in
downstream metropolitan areas.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化表示和丰富数据集，提升了复杂视觉场景下的推理和理解能力。

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of
text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the
need for effective integration of visual perception and textual comprehension,
particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover,
existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the
detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to
hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual
elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that
utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML,
and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver
contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured
datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs
for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data
annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding
benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in
complex visual scenarios. Our code and models are released at https://github.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为阈值调制（TM）的在线测试时间适应框架，用于提升脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在分布偏移下的泛化能力，同时保持低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线测试时间适应方法主要针对传统人工神经网络，不适用于SNNs，因此需要一种更兼容神经形态硬件的解决方案。

Method: 通过神经元动力学启发的归一化动态调整脉冲阈值，提出阈值调制（TM）方法。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效提升了SNNs在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: TM方法为SNNs的在线测试时间适应提供了实用解决方案，并为未来神经形态芯片设计提供了启发。

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,
provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.
However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has
become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a
promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data
distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.
Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional
artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this
gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time
adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution
shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which
dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired
normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in
improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining
low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for
online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of
future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at
github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从无色3D扫描中直接重建头发丝的新方法，利用多模态头发方向提取技术，解决了现有方法依赖RGB数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头发丝重建是计算机视觉和图形学中的基础问题，对高保真数字角色合成、动画和AR/VR应用至关重要。然而，由于人类头发的复杂性和细粒度结构，从原始扫描数据中准确恢复头发丝仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过从扫描中提取尖锐表面特征，并利用神经2D线检测器估计头发丝方向。此外，结合了基于合成头发扫描的扩散先验，并通过扫描特定文本提示优化。

Result: 该方法能够在不依赖颜色信息的情况下，准确重建简单和复杂的发型。

Conclusion: 研究还发布了Strands400数据集，包含400名受试者的头发丝重建数据，以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from
colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair
strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics
that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and
AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan
data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained
structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be
sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the
orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging
hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our
method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand
orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan
shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse
set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and
adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We
demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate
reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color
information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the
largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface
geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair
strands from the scans of 400 subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSMs）的事件去噪框架，通过空间和时间Mamba模块高效处理事件云的时空特征，在精度和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高动态范围和低延迟特性使其适用于高速视觉，但输出噪声高，现有去噪方法在计算复杂性和鲁棒性之间存在矛盾。

Method: 将事件表示为4D事件云，结合几何和极性感知子空间的粗特征提取模块，以及空间Mamba（S-SSM）和时间Mamba（T-SSM）模块。

Result: 模型参数88.89K，推理时间0.0685s/100K事件，精度0.982，比Transformer方法高2.08%，速度快36倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持事件相机高速优势的同时，实现了高效且鲁棒的去噪性能。

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high-speed vision due to their high temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption. However, as dynamic
vision sensors, their output is inherently noisy, making efficient denoising
essential to preserve their ultra-low latency and real-time processing
capabilities. Existing event denoising methods struggle with a critical
dilemma: computationally intensive approaches compromise the sensor's
high-speed advantage, while lightweight methods often lack robustness across
varying noise levels. To address this, we propose a novel event denoising
framework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Our approach represents events as
4D event clouds and includes a Coarse Feature Extraction (CFE) module that
extracts embedding features from both geometric and polarity-aware subspaces.
The model is further composed of two essential components: A Spatial Mamba
(S-SSM) that models local geometric structures and a Temporal Mamba (T-SSM)
that captures global temporal dynamics, efficiently propagating spatiotemporal
features across events. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency, with 88.89K parameters, 0.0685s per
100K events inference time, and a 0.982 accuracy score, outperforming
Transformer-based methods by 2.08% in denoising accuracy and 36X faster.

Motivation: 路边点云3D目标检测尚未被充分探索，其性能关键取决于网络的感受野和场景上下文利用能力。Mamba（基于状态空间模型）因其高效全局感受野成为新选择。

Method: 提出PillarMamba框架，结合CSG实现跨阶段特征融合，并通过HSB解决局部连接中断和历史关系遗忘问题，利用局部卷积和残差注意力获取局部-全局上下文。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X-I基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PillarMamba通过结合CSG和HSB，有效提升了路边点云检测的性能，为智能交通系统提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Serving the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X) tasks, roadside perception has received increasing attention in recent
years, as it can extend the perception range of connected vehicles and improve
traffic safety. However, roadside point cloud oriented 3D object detection has
not been effectively explored. To some extent, the key to the performance of a
point cloud detector lies in the receptive field of the network and the ability
to effectively utilize the scene context. The recent emergence of Mamba, based
on State Space Model (SSM), has shaken up the traditional convolution and
transformers that have long been the foundational building blocks, due to its
efficient global receptive field. In this work, we introduce Mamba to
pillar-based roadside point cloud perception and propose a framework based on
Cross-stage State-space Group (CSG), called PillarMamba. It enhances the
expressiveness of the network and achieves efficient computation through
cross-stage feature fusion. However, due to the limitations of scan directions,
state space model faces local connection disrupted and historical relationship
forgotten. To address this, we propose the Hybrid State-space Block (HSB) to
obtain the local-global context of roadside point cloud. Specifically, it
enhances neighborhood connections through local convolution and preserves
historical memory through residual attention. The proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods on the popular large scale roadside benchmark:
DAIR-V2X-I. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: SITE为评估空间智能提供了标准化工具，揭示了模型在空间推理上的不足及其与具身AI任务的关联。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the
visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships,
underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a
benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of
multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large
vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities
(single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental
scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static
and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up
survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three
classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two
novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive
experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in
spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a
positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its
performance on an embodied AI task.

Result: 生成稳定、多样且美观的LEGO设计，支持人工和机器人组装，并发布数据集和代码。

Conclusion: LegoGPT为文本到LEGO设计提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable
LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a
large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their
associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to
predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the
stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and
physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible
token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments
show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO
designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a
text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We
show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by
robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over
47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed
captions, along with our code and models at the project website:

Motivation: 将强化学习引入流匹配模型以提升生成任务的准确性和效率。

Method: 1. ODE-to-SDE转换，实现统计采样；2. 去噪减少策略，提升训练效率。

Result: 在复杂构图和视觉文本渲染任务中，准确率显著提升（如GenEval从63%到95%），且未牺牲图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: Flow-GRPO在生成任务中高效且稳定，未出现奖励作弊现象。

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our
experiments.

Result: Mogao在多模态理解和文本到图像生成任务中达到最优性能，并展现出零样本图像编辑和组合生成的潜力。

Conclusion: Mogao作为全能模态基础模型，为未来统一多模态系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has
been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation
conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified
framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal
generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical
improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual
vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal
classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both
autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality
image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly
effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To
further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient
training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for
joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and
text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent
interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and
compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation
model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified
multi-modal systems.

Motivation: 当前SfM方法通常采用两阶段流程，结合学习或几何对偶推理与全局优化。DiffusionSfM旨在直接通过多视图推理实现更高效的3D重建。

Method: DiffusionSfM将场景几何和相机姿态参数化为全局坐标系中的像素级射线起点和终点，并采用基于Transformer的去噪扩散模型进行预测。针对训练中的缺失数据和无界场景坐标问题，引入了专用机制。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，DiffusionSfM优于传统和基于学习的方法，并能自然建模不确定性。

Conclusion: DiffusionSfM通过数据驱动的多视图推理方法，实现了高效的3D场景重建，展示了扩散模型在SfM任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods typically follow a two-stage
pipeline, combining learned or geometric pairwise reasoning with a subsequent
global optimization step. In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view
reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from
multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry
and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and
employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from
multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models
with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized
mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on
both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical
and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.

Abstract: 3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically
meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive
media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on
procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in
deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations
(e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene
distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent
advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by
reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides
a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four
paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based
generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations,
trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets,
evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing
key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations,
and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity,
physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation
models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and
highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从单张图像生成3D化身时存在局限性：3D高斯泼溅需要多视角数据，而视频扩散模型难以保持一致性。SVAD旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: SVAD通过视频扩散生成合成训练数据，加入身份保持和图像修复模块，并用这些数据训练3D高斯泼溅化身。

Result: SVAD在身份一致性和细节保持上优于现有单图像方法，支持实时渲染，且无需依赖密集训练数据。

Conclusion: SVAD通过结合扩散模型和高斯泼溅技术，为单图像生成高保真3D化身提供了新方法。

Abstract: Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains
a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of
reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current
approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences,
while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but
struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel
approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths
of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through
video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration
modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details
across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering
capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the
dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by
traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons
show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against
baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion
models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our
work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a
single image input.

characterized. In this study, we present \textbf{AR}tificial
\textbf{I}ntelligence research assistant for \textbf{E}xpert-involved
\textbf{L}earning (ARIEL), a multimodal dataset designed to benchmark and
enhance two critical capabilities of LLMs and LMMs in biomedical research:
summarizing extensive scientific texts and interpreting complex biomedical
figures. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we create two open-source sets
comprising biomedical articles and figures with designed questions. We
systematically benchmark both open- and closed-source foundation models,
incorporating expert-driven human evaluations conducted by doctoral-level
experts. Furthermore, we improve model performance through targeted prompt
engineering and fine-tuning strategies for summarizing research papers, and
apply test-time computational scaling to enhance the reasoning capabilities of
LMMs, achieving superior accuracy compared to human-expert corrections. We also
explore the potential of using LMM Agents to generate scientific hypotheses
from diverse multimodal inputs. Overall, our results delineate clear strengths
and highlight significant limitations of current foundation models, providing
actionable insights and guiding future advancements in deploying large-scale
language and multi-modal models within biomedical research.

### [130] [Computational Irreducibility as the Foundation of Agency: A Formal Model Connecting Undecidability to Autonomous Behavior in Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04646)
*Poria Azadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自主性和能动性的起源，通过将计算限制（可判定性、完备性、计算不可约性）与物理概念结合，提出了一种在潜在图灵完备环境中的“最小代理”形式模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解自主性和能动性的计算基础，尤其是在复杂环境中如何产生不可预测性和新信息。

Method: 使用算法信息理论，分析代理与环境的交互中的不可判定性和计算不可约性，提出代理行为的不可预测性是能动性的必要条件。

Result: 证明了真正的自主性必然意味着从外部视角的不可判定性，并提出了代理与环境耦合复杂性导致能动性产生的框架。

Conclusion: 该框架将能动性与交互的计算特性直接关联，对理解意识、设计自主AI以及在确定性但计算不可约的宇宙中重新定义自由意志具有启示。

Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting
fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational
irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a
"minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.
Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability
and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to
unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective
goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external
prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate
this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of
its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central
thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies
undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems
from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment
coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and
relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical
solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This
framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,
offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,
and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally
irreducible universe.

*Enqiang Zhu,Chenkai Hao,Chanjuan Liu,Yongsheng Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DynLS的高效算法，用于解决最大加权独立集（MWIS）问题，以优化智能交通系统（ITS）。该算法通过三种创新技术显著提升了性能，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在智能交通系统中能生成高质量数据和优化方案，但其在大规模和复杂场景中需要大量训练时间和计算资源。因此，需要一种更高效的算法来解决MWIS问题，以支持ITS应用。

Method: DynLS算法结合了三种创新技术：基于分数的自适应顶点扰动（SAVP）加速收敛，区域定位机制（RLM）避免局部最优，以及结合顶点交换策略和奖励机制的变量邻域下降策略（ComLS）。

Result: 实验结果显示，DynLS在360个测试实例中表现最佳，其中350个实例达到最优解，且收敛速度与第二优算法Cyclic-Fast相当。

Conclusion: DynLS算法在MWIS问题上取得了显著进展，为智能交通系统的优化提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at
generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant
training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and
complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient
algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem,
which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal
control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our
proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it
effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP)
technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it
includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by
dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable
neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies
with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our
experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently
delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five
leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for
350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177
instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed,
highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a
significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering
a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent
transportation systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑证明教学中生成动态反馈的潜力，发现DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明构建中表现最佳，但生成的提示在解释上下文方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在命题逻辑教学中依赖模板化反馈，缺乏个性化。LLMs虽能动态生成反馈，但存在幻觉或教学不合理的风险。

Method: 评估了四种LLMs在358个命题逻辑问题上的六种提示技术，并利用最佳模型为1,050个学生问题状态生成提示，通过LLM评分和专家评估验证。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明构建中准确率达84.4%，生成的提示在准确性和清晰度上表现良好，但在解释上下文方面较弱。

Conclusion: LLMs可增强辅导系统的逻辑教学提示，但需进一步改进以确保准确性和教学合理性。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching
formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based
explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic
feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically
unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in
constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting
techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic
problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with
84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in
simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory
hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and
evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings
on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate
and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not
perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our
results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with
logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy
and pedagogical appropriateness.

### [133] [Is there Value in Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04822)
*Lior Fox,Yonatan Loewenstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文讨论了强化学习中动作值（action-values）的显式表示问题，批评了转向策略梯度（PG）模型作为解决方案的观点，认为PG模型仍需依赖值的学习。建议重新评估标准RL框架的底层假设，并强调在认知科学中应考虑算法的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨强化学习中动作值的显式表示争议，指出PG模型并非完全摆脱值依赖，提出应重新审视RL框架的底层假设。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较PG和VB模型的依赖关系，并讨论标准RL假设的局限性。

Result: PG模型仍需依赖值的学习，标准RL假设在自然环境中可能不适用，需重新考虑值的定义。

Conclusion: 建议将辩论焦点转向底层假设的评估，强调在模型评估中应考虑算法复杂性，而不仅仅是统计复杂性。

Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)
models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented
has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that
policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a
potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is
unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" --
while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting
(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching
to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of
behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems
from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by
the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve
it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as
part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the
different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,
instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the
underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from
an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be
reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,
full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are
relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as
a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than
statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our
analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional
aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when
evaluating model complexity.

Motivation: 传统ACD方法依赖单智能体RL，存在训练成本高、解释性差和可迁移性不足的问题，LLM有望解决这些问题。

Method: 在CybORG CAGE 4环境中集成LLM，提出新的通信协议，评估LLM与RL智能体的协作。

Result: 揭示了LLM和RL在多智能体ACD中的优缺点，为未来研究提供了方向。

Conclusion: LLM在多智能体ACD中表现潜力，但仍需进一步研究优化协作与部署。

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research
directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

Motivation: 现有模型在非西方文化上的表现不佳，可能导致错误结果或传播刻板印象，因此需要解决文化适应性问题。

Method: 提出了一种收集和处理文化代码数据的方法，构建了俄罗斯文化数据集，并在Kandinsky 3.1模型上测试。

Result: 人类评估显示，模型对俄罗斯文化的理解有所提升。

Conclusion: 文化代码数据集能有效提升模型在特定文化领域的生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with
international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge
gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large
training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on
Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural
adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the
generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an
effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and
recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image
generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the
research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and
processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in
particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the
quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of
our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation
results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in
the model.

Result: 提出了enigme工具，可用于评估和训练Transformer-decoder模型及其他未来AI架构的推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过特定设计的推理任务，可以更清晰地了解Transformer-decoder模型的推理能力边界，为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based
generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as
general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their
utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the
reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning
process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this
approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the
architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent
variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning
tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present
enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in
training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and
future AI architectures.

Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of
artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states
represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the
Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured
ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware
operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper
illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a
linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief
filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study
highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through
structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to
new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.

Conclusion: 认知人工智能是解决AI鲁棒性问题的潜在方向。

Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in
generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in
the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training
data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make
robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced
by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and
domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards
epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not
only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which
focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to
improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can
better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences
faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding
10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review
quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to
transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback
loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal
accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a
sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be
viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and
system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share
responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only
be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical
concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper
focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through
two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows
authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a
systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask
for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are
needed to enhance the peer review process.

Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to
collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society.
Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative
multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the
use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,
dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation
dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct
interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves
and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for
future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet
effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining
cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can
give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation
of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the
preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing
device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with
learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)
has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the
floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL
with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference
process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating
various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the
need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's
generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of
circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%
improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a
standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,
performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing
state-of-the-art techniques.

In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven
sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed
at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental
evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures,
and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results
demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight
under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious

Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the
application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems
are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and
interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and
actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world
feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and
unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL),
reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied
AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications
spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most
research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed
environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex
scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their
surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating
sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative
problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing
research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail
to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent
embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the
advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to

### [145] [Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05115)
*Toby Ord*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI代理在长时任务中的表现可用简单数学模型解释，即每分钟固定失败率，导致成功率随任务时长指数下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Kwa等人（2025）的实证研究，探索AI代理在长时任务中失败率的规律。

Method: 提出一个数学模型，假设每分钟固定失败率，推导出成功率随任务时长指数下降的关系。

Result: 模型与数据拟合良好，表明长时任务的失败可能由子任务链中任一环节失败导致。

Conclusion: 该模型适用于特定任务集，是否普遍适用需进一步研究。

Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that
within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents
on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical
model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do
the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length
of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.
This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent
at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the
data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that
they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails
the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is
unknown and an important subject for further work.

### [146] [MARK: Memory Augmented Refinement of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05177)
*Anish Ganguli,Prabal Deb,Debleena Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARK框架通过结构化记忆增强LLMs，使其无需重新训练即可持续学习，提升领域适应性和个性化响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域知识动态更新和个性化需求中的不足，减少幻觉并提升准确性。

Method: 利用三个专门代理（残余记忆、用户问题记忆、LLM响应记忆）存储、分析和优化领域知识。

Result: MARK框架显著提升LLMs在领域适应、个性化响应和减少幻觉方面的表现。

Conclusion: MARK为LLMs提供了一种高效、持续的领域知识更新机制，适用于专业领域和个性化场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to
align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain
knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')
and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:
Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a
significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced
understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate
information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of
Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without
retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of
Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:
Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to
maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures
user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;
LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for
refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,
detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.
Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information
while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground
Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;
Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and
manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;
Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user
preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“appropriateness framework”的替代方法，以解决AI决策中的道德多样性问题，强调冲突管理而非道德统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的道德对齐方法忽视了道德多样性，可能导致信任危机和制度不稳定。

Method: 基于冲突理论、文化演化、多智能体系统和制度经济学，提出了包含四项原则的appropriateness framework：上下文基础、社区定制、持续适应和多中心治理。

Result: 该框架将道德对齐的隐喻从统一转向冲突管理，更具实用性和紧迫性。

Conclusion: 采用appropriateness framework的设计原则是解决AI道德多样性问题的可行且紧迫的方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions
where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces,
conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe
and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have
been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems,
which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust,
and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to
an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal
conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a
single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose
what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in
conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional
economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the
normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual
grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4)
polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is
a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a
more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is
both desirable and urgent.

### [149] [Advancing Neural Network Verification through Hierarchical Safety Abstract Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05235)
*Luca Marzari,Isabella Mastroeni,Alessandro Farinelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为抽象DNN验证的新方法，通过层次化分析不安全输出，提供更细粒度的安全性评估，相比传统二元验证方法更高效且详细。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN形式化验证方法仅以二元方式（安全/不安全）评估模型，无法捕捉安全性的细微差别，导致要求过于严格或宽松。

Method: 利用抽象解释和输出可达集分析，验证不安全输出的层次结构，评估多个安全级别。

Result: 方法在保持或减少计算成本的同时，提供了更详细的安全性评估，并能对对抗性输入按安全级别排序。

Conclusion: 抽象DNN验证方法为DNN安全性提供了更全面的分析框架，优于传统二元验证方法。

Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks
(DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model
is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary
encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often
resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this
paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract
DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs,
providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN.
Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output
reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during
the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less
computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach.
Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial
inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more
detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions
include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel
abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract
interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel
problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep
reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard
DNN-Verification benchmarks.

*Biao Yi,Xavier Hu,Yurun Chen,Shengyu Zhang,Hongxia Yang,Fan Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAgent是一个边缘-云协作的多代理框架，旨在解决基于云的移动代理的高延迟和成本问题，同时保持任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于云的移动代理（如MLLMs）虽然推理能力强，但存在高延迟和高成本问题；而边缘部署的模型（如MSLMs）虽能降低延迟和成本，但通用能力和复杂任务处理能力较弱。

Method: 提出EcoAgent框架，包括云端的规划代理和边缘的执行代理与观察代理，通过闭环协作实现任务自动化。观察代理使用预理解模块压缩图像以减少令牌使用，规划代理通过反思模块在失败时重新规划。

Result: 在AndroidWorld上的实验表明，EcoAgent在保持高任务成功率的同时，显著减少了MLLM令牌的消耗。

Conclusion: EcoAgent实现了高效且实用的移动自动化，平衡了性能和成本。

Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models
((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and
cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general
capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose
EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile
automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based
Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action
execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation
Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise
text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves
screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld
show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly
reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile
automation.

### [152] [Conversational Process Model Redesign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05453)
*Nataliia Klievtsova,Timotheus Kampik,Juergen Mangler,Stefanie Rinderle-Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）支持业务过程管理系统的可行性，提出了一种多步骤的对话式过程模型重设计（CPD）方法，并通过评估验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注单次提示执行，而忽视了用户与LLM的持续交互。本文旨在探索LLM在迭代式过程模型设计与重设计中的潜力。

Method: 提出CPD方法，通过LLM识别过程变更模式、对齐变更请求的表述，并应用变更到模型，实现可解释和可复现的修改。

Result: 评估表明LLM能较好地处理多数变更，但某些模式对LLM和用户来说较难理解，用户需支持以清晰描述变更。

Conclusion: LLM在业务过程管理中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以支持用户更清晰地表达变更需求。

Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of
AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One
of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally
actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform
crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.
However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and
evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user
and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to
empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an
iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign
(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the
user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM
is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)
re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the
identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of
the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for
explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the
CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be
handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that
some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of
the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes
clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes
well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态融合模型MatMMFuse，结合CGCNN和SciBERT，提升了材料属性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模态模型无法充分利用不同表示的优势，结合图编码器和文本编码器可以增强特征空间。

Method: 使用多头注意力机制融合CGCNN的结构嵌入和SciBERT的文本嵌入，端到端训练。

Result: 在四种关键属性上均优于单一模型，形成能预测提升40%（CGCNN）和68%（SciBERT）。

Conclusion: MatMMFuse在零样本任务中表现优异，适用于数据稀缺的工业应用。

Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for
high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful.
However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the
advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different
representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can
encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models.
Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text
encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal
symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a
fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the
combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution
Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model
in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We
show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN
and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap,
energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of
40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model
for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the
zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of
Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the
proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain
vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model
for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is
prohibitively expensive.

*Shai Feldman,Stephen Bates,Yaniv Romano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在标签数据被噪声或缺失污染时进行鲁棒不确定性量化的框架，扩展了共形预测方法，并分析了其权重不准确时的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据标签被污染（噪声或缺失）时，传统共形预测因i.i.d假设失效而无法保证预测集有效性的问题。

Method: 提出特权共形预测（PCP）利用特权信息重新加权数据分布，并引入不确定插补（UI）方法避免权重估计。

Result: PCP在权重估计不准确时仍能提供有效的不确定性估计，UI方法通过保留标签不确定性实现鲁棒预测。

Conclusion: 结合PCP和UI的三重鲁棒框架，确保只要至少一种方法有效，预测结果即统计有效。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations
where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We
build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction
sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity
of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does
not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this
distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed
leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only
during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid
prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this
work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our
analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even
when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain
imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight
estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their
uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated
empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these
techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring
statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is
valid.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SetONet是一种新型神经网络架构，通过结合Deep Sets原理解决了DeepONet在输入函数采样位置固定时的局限性，适用于可变传感器配置、缺失数据或不规则网格的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DeepONet要求输入函数在固定位置采样，限制了其在可变传感器配置、缺失数据或不规则网格中的应用。SetONet旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SetONet通过分支网络处理输入函数为无序的位置-值对集合，确保输入点的排列不变性，并显式处理空间坐标和函数值。

Result: SetONet在多个基准问题（如导数/反导数算子、1D Darcy流和2D弹性）中表现优于标准DeepONet，尤其在可变输入采样条件下。

Conclusion: SetONet扩展了神经算子工具包的灵活性，显著提升了在可变或不完整输入数据问题中的适用性。

Abstract: Neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), have
shown promise in learning mappings between function spaces for solving
differential equations. However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to
be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability in scenarios with
variable sensor configurations, missing data, or irregular grids. We introduce
the Set Operator Network (SetONet), a novel architecture that integrates Deep
Sets principles into the DeepONet framework to address this limitation. The
core innovation lies in the SetONet branch network, which processes the input
function as an unordered \emph{set} of location-value pairs. This design
ensures permutation invariance with respect to the input points, making SetONet
inherently robust to variations in the number and locations of sensors. SetONet
learns richer, spatially-aware input representations by explicitly processing
spatial coordinates and function values. We demonstrate SetONet's effectiveness
on several benchmark problems, including derivative/anti-derivative operators,
1D Darcy flow, and 2D elasticity. Results show that SetONet successfully learns
operators under variable input sampling conditions where standard DeepONet
fails. Furthermore, SetONet is architecturally robust to sensor drop-off;
unlike standard DeepONet, which requires methods like interpolation to function
with missing data. Notably, SetONet can achieve comparable or improved accuracy
over DeepONet on fixed grids, particularly for nonlinear problems, likely due
to its enhanced input representation. SetONet provides a flexible and robust
extension to the neural operator toolkit, significantly broadening the
applicability of operator learning to problems with variable or incomplete
input data.

Motivation: 重新审视数据质量对模型性能的影响，探索预训练与后训练协同设计的可能性，特别是毒性数据对模型控制的作用。

Method: 通过玩具实验分析数据组成对特征几何的影响，并利用Olmo-1B模型进行控制实验，研究毒性数据比例对线性表示和模型性能的影响。

Result: 增加毒性数据使毒性概念在表示空间中更线性可分，虽然基础模型毒性增加，但后训练时更易去除。

Conclusion: 结合后训练技术，适当使用毒性数据可以优化模型在降低毒性和保留能力之间的平衡。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to
determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality"
from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we
explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better
control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.
First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the
geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled
experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic
data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear
representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show
that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,
it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real
Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better
trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general
capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention
(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into
account, bad data may lead to good models.

Conclusion: 新方法在性能上与基于拉格朗日启发式的方法相当，且更具通用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to contextual stochastic optimization,
integrating operations research and machine learning to address decision-making
under uncertainty. Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual
information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study,
we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode
policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from
past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a
surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is
applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our
approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new
regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex.
This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate
diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our
algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of
the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a
contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our
algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to
imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based
heuristic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算在推理时带来额外计算成本，ViaSHAP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ViaSHAP方法，探索基于通用逼近定理和Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的两种实现方式。

Result: ViaSHAP在表格数据上表现与先进算法相当，解释准确性显著优于FastSHAP。

Conclusion: ViaSHAP通过直接学习Shapley值函数，提高了计算效率和解释准确性。

Abstract: Shapley values have several desirable, theoretically well-supported,
properties for explaining black-box model predictions. Traditionally, Shapley
values are computed post-hoc, leading to additional computational cost at
inference time. To overcome this, a novel method, called ViaSHAP, is proposed,
that learns a function to compute Shapley values, from which the predictions
can be derived directly by summation. Two approaches to implement the proposed
method are explored; one based on the universal approximation theorem and the
other on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Results from a
large-scale empirical investigation are presented, showing that ViaSHAP using
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms for
tabular data. It is also shown that the explanations of ViaSHAP are
significantly more accurate than the popular approximator FastSHAP on both
tabular data and images.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of ML decision-making systems across products and services
has led to a set of regulations on how such systems should behave and be built.
Among all the technical challenges to enforcing these regulations, one crucial,
yet under-explored problem is the risk of manipulation while these systems are
being audited for fairness. This manipulation occurs when a platform
deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without
modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's
prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that
regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms
could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the
conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior
knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard
datasets exemplify the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before
being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of
manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for
more robust fairness audits.

TL;DR: ORBIT-2是一种用于全球高分辨率气候降尺度的可扩展基础模型，通过Reslim轻量架构和TILES算法解决了现有AI方法的局限性，实现了高效、高精度的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏观测和低分辨率气候模型限制了区域决策的有效性，需要更强大的降尺度方法。现有AI方法在跨变量和地理区域的泛化能力不足，且受限于ViT自注意力的二次复杂度。

Method: ORBIT-2引入Reslim（轻量架构，含残差学习和贝叶斯正则化）和TILES（将自注意力复杂度从二次降至线性），支持大规模并行处理。

Result: ORBIT-2在32,768个GPU上扩展到100亿参数，实现1.8 ExaFLOPS吞吐量，支持0.9公里全球分辨率降尺度，7公里基准测试中R^2得分0.98-0.99。

Conclusion: ORBIT-2通过创新架构和算法，显著提升了气候降尺度的效率和精度，为全球高分辨率气候建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective
regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling.
However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and
geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision
Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation
model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates
two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture
with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust
prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces
self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence
processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters
across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and
92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global
resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution
benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98
to 0.99 against observation data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PieCoN的图神经网络，通过结合常数谱滤波器和多项式滤波器，更灵活地利用图结构，解决了现有谱GNN因多项式阶数限制而无法充分捕捉谱特性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱GNN因多项式阶数小，无法充分识别图谱特性，而增加阶数又会导致计算成本高或性能下降。

Method: 提出PieCoN，结合常数谱滤波器和多项式滤波器，自适应地将谱划分为区间，以更灵活地学习谱特性。

Result: 在九个基准数据集（包括同质和异质图）上的实验表明，PieCoN在异质图上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: PieCoN为解决谱GNN的局限性提供了有效方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various
domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which
use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not
fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's
small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally
expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or
degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph
Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant
spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to
leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into
intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be
effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly
effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range
of applications.

Motivation: 当前缺乏一种通用的方法来条件化蛋白质生成模型，以整合实验反馈或利用现有分类器指导生成具有特定性质的蛋白质序列。

Method: 通过统一包括掩码语言模型、自回归模型、扩散模型和流匹配模型在内的多种蛋白质生成模型，提出了一种统计条件化的方法。

Result: 实验证明，ProteinGuide能够成功指导ProteinMPNN和ESM3生成具有增强稳定性和特定折叠结构的蛋白质序列。

Conclusion: ProteinGuide为蛋白质工程提供了一个灵活且强大的条件化生成框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein
engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary
information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively
incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier --
such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the
sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties.
Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve
just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that
includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and
flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition
pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our
approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models,
ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences
conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability
and CATH-labeled fold generation.

Motivation: 现有RL方法放弃学习价值函数，依赖经验估计回报，限制了测试时计算扩展。RL$^V$旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RL$^V$通过联合训练LLM作为推理器和生成验证器，利用RL生成的数据，增加验证能力。

Result: RL$^V$在MATH任务上准确率提升20%以上，测试时计算效率提升8-32倍，并在泛化任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RL$^V$是一种高效的RL方法，显著提升了LLM推理和验证能力，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners,
such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor
of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that
relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose
RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM
as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding
verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$
boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables
$8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL
method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both
easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves
$1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential
test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.

Conclusion: 文章指出了FL-CPS领域的重要问题，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a
complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision
making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are
also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize
the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to
ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be
trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining
popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and
physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the
numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in
recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and
CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of
FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further
depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article
scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent
transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart
healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons
learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section
delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in
this fast-paced and dynamic era.

TL;DR: ConCISE框架通过增强模型推理时的信心，减少冗余步骤，显著缩短输出长度，同时保持高任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但常因冗余内容导致输出冗长，增加计算开销并降低用户体验。现有压缩方法存在破坏推理连贯性或无法有效干预生成过程的问题。

Method: 提出ConCISE框架，通过信心注入稳定中间步骤，并在信心足够时提前终止推理，防止冗余步骤生成。

Result: 实验表明，ConCISE能将输出长度减少约50%，同时保持高准确性，并在多个推理基准上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: ConCISE通过信心引导的压缩方法，有效解决了LRMs输出冗余问题，提升了推理效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused
by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user
experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning,
risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection,
which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we
introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant
reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the
model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination
Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based
on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In
Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains
by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the
generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to
stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when
confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing
length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task
accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: FedRE通过分层分配隐私预算优化LDP，保护隐私敏感信息（PSI），同时减少不必要噪声，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能考虑客户隐私偏好差异，统一扰动导致性能下降，需针对性保护PSI。

Method: 定义PSI，分层优化LDP隐私预算分配，设计基于扰动信息分布的参数聚合机制。

Result: 在T-SROIE和DocTamper数据集上，FedRE性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedRE在保护PSI的同时，实现了模型性能与隐私保护的平衡。

Abstract: Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server
for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private
information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients
from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local
differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy
guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account
by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may
have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI),
which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case,
excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can
additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model
performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that
can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP
protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy
preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less
privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus
providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the
performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation
mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted
experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and
FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 理解细胞间通信（CCC）对揭示细胞异质性和生物功能至关重要，现有工具如CellChat已证明CCC在细胞分化、组织再生和免疫反应中的关键作用。

Method: CCCVAE利用配体-受体相互作用的通信感知核和稀疏高斯过程，将生物先验信息编码到潜在空间中，同时考虑转录相似性和细胞间信号上下文。

Result: 在四个scRNA-seq数据集上的实验表明，CCCVAE的聚类性能优于标准VAE基线，评估分数更高。

Conclusion: CCCVAE展示了将生物先验嵌入深度生成模型在无监督单细胞分析中的价值。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular
heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological
function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling
interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular
behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role
in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune
response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information
about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational
autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell
representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived
from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes
biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs
that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to
reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.
Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves
clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE
baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into
deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.

Result: TH-GCN减少切换次数达78%，信号质量提升10%。

Conclusion: TH-GCN通过双中心视角优化切换管理，显著提升5G网络在高移动性环境中的稳定性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 5G has transformed vehicular networks, offering high
bandwidth, low latency, and fast data rates essential for real-time
applications in smart cities and vehicles. These improvements enhance traffic
safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent
handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility
environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN
(Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for
optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural
networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic
graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed,
and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station
perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover
decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN
reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10
percent, outperforming existing methods.

Method: 提出非渐近状态演化理论，适用于非高斯特征，分析梯度下降迭代在训练和泛化中的行为。

Result: 理论表明梯度下降可以用于估计泛化误差，指导早期停止和超参数调整，同时模型保留单索引函数结构。

Conclusion: 本文为有限宽度多层神经网络提供了新的理论框架，扩展了现有理论的应用范围。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the
canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional
regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while
the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution
theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration
in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF)
theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory
operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are
fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from
individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF
are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies
on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both
training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks
beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study
generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be
augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each
iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.
As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model
misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure
of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear
combination of the true signal and the initialization.

Result: VaCDA在跨位置和跨设备场景中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VaCDA通过结合VAE和对比学习，有效减少了数据异构性，提升了活动识别的性能。

Abstract: Technological advancements have led to the rise of wearable devices with
sensors that continuously monitor user activities, generating vast amounts of
unlabeled data. This data is challenging to interpret, and manual annotation is
labor-intensive and error-prone. Additionally, data distribution is often
heterogeneous due to device placement, type, and user behavior variations. As a
result, traditional transfer learning methods perform suboptimally, making it
difficult to recognize daily activities. To address these challenges, we use a
variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a shared, low-dimensional latent space
from available sensor data. This space generalizes data across diverse sensors,
mitigating heterogeneity and aiding robust adaptation to the target domain. We
integrate contrastive learning to enhance feature representation by aligning
instances of the same class across domains while separating different classes.
We propose Variational Contrastive Domain Adaptation (VaCDA), a multi-source
domain adaptation framework combining VAEs and contrastive learning to improve
feature representation and reduce heterogeneity between source and target
domains. We evaluate VaCDA on multiple publicly available datasets across three
heterogeneity scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, and cross-device. VaCDA
outperforms the baselines in cross-position and cross-device scenarios.

Result: 在ERA5数据集上，PASSAT表现优于现有深度学习和数值天气预报模型。

Conclusion: PASSAT通过结合物理和拓扑信息，显著提升了天气预报的准确性。

Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in
weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the
underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface.
In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted
And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT
attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process
that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes
equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model
and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into
consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these
considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph
neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the
initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation
from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution
ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based
weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction
model IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both
predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic
groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable
depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted
increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of
uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we
investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage
(EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for
depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions
through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants
by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify
uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically
guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and
facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.
Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates
fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This
enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the
heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving
optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio
depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various
scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities
of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such,
with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning
tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as
the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to
date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed
that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)
vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge
embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to
link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs
and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective
that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather
than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis
concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both
viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG
transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to
create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that
link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.
  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced. This thesis was
written bilingually, with the main document in English and an informal extended
summary in Irish. An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning
terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as
well.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential
to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation
learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing
visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its
infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model
proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that
distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves
as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical
foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving
that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual
information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that
the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable
lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a
series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition,
Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node
and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of
the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative
models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph
representation learning.

*Gekko Budiutama,Shunsuke Daimon,Hirofumi Nishi,Yu-ichiro Matsushita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应变换方法（GT），通过学习数据驱动的映射，优于传统变换方法，适用于多种机器学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散变换依赖于对数据集特性的了解，而GT旨在解决这一局限性，提供更通用的解决方案。

Method: GT通过学习数据驱动的映射，自适应地为数据集和任务生成变换表示。

Result: 实验表明，GT在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中优于传统变换方法。

Conclusion: GT是一种有效的自适应变换方法，适用于多样化的学习场景。

Abstract: Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used
in machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful
features. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate
one often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the
approach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we
propose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation
designed for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT
learns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,
we demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional
transform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language
processing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

*Zhifeng Hu,Chong Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）和深度强化学习（DRL）的资源分配算法（GLOVE），用于动态太赫兹（THz）无人机网络中的高效资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态拓扑和混合整数非线性规划（MINLP）问题阻碍了THz无人机网络中资源分配的高效性，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 结合GNN和DRL，强调自节点特征，并采用多任务结构联合训练功率和子阵列资源分配决策。

Result: GLOVE在资源效率和延迟方面优于基准方法，且保持零丢包率。

Conclusion: GLOVE在动态THz无人机网络中表现出更高的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible
topologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous
applications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental
monitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient
long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among
UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of
antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.
Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a
graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the
dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is
proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.
When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship
between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the
important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure
is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for
the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that
GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest
latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE
maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating
its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索行为生物特征在透明多因素认证中的潜力，尤其是键盘硬件对用户输入行为的影响。

Method: 通过ABM生成五种代理的合成击键数据，提取特征（如停留时间、飞行时间和错误率），并评估OC-SVM和RF的用户验证性能。

Result: RF在单一键盘内用户识别表现良好（准确率>0.7），但跨键盘泛化能力差；OC-SVM则无法区分用户。

Conclusion: 键盘特异性用户档案可能更可靠，且RF在捕捉用户细粒度模式上优于OC-SVM。

Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics
offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication
setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.
This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical
and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data
from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,
and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two
machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and
Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a
stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate
individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust
intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize
across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of
keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)
keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,
and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing
fine-grained user-specific patterns.

Motivation: 解决合成临床数据在隐私保护和数据可用性方面的挑战，同时确保数据的高保真度和实用性。

Method: 系统评估四种超参数优化策略在八种生成模型上的表现，比较单一指标与复合指标优化方法。

Result: 超参数优化显著提升数据质量，复合指标优化表现更优，但需预处理和后处理确保临床有效性。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和优化策略是生成高质量合成临床数据的关键，未来需进一步验证和优化。

Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach
to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical
research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity,
utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge.
While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative
model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for
synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates
four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric
optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results
demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE,
CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%,
respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric
strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets.
Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic
data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints.
Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these
violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in
up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating
explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic
datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic
data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and
validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.

Motivation: 解决循环层在建模长序列时的困难，同时保持参数数量不变，并实现对长时间依赖的高效建模。

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAE）结合循环层，引入逐步增加序列长度的训练方案。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其适用于准周期性时间序列，同时在非平稳数据上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过巧妙组合已知组件，RVAE-ST在生成模型性能上达到或超越现有最佳模型。

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based
on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the
Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our
method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the
sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when
modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model
maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This
design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient
modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a
fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination
of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models
on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time
series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on
datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate
its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and
visualizations of the learned embeddings.

Result: 理论证明方法具有均匀逼近和有界时间分数，实验在互信息和密度估计任务中优于基线。

Conclusion: D³RE框架在密度比估计中表现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences,
yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or
inadequately overlap supports, suffering from the \textit{density-chasm} and
the \textit{support-chasm} problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield
divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We propose
$\text{D}^3\text{RE}$, a unified framework for robust and efficient density
ratio estimation. It introduces the Dequantified Diffusion-Bridge Interpolant
(DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion
bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the Dequantified
Schr\"odinger-Bridge Interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve
the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method
offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms
baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Result: 在包含1000个任务的合成网络上验证了方法的有效性，实现了接近最优的调度结果且约束违反最小。

Conclusion: 神经优化模型为不确定性下的任务调度提供了可扩展且自适应的解决方案，适用于现代AI系统。

Abstract: Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge
in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations
and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The
Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to
model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a
novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a
Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and
precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks
inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent
schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy
function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends
the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on
synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the
viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal
constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models
offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling
under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based
applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅评估LLM在英语提示下的表现，忽视了多语言开发者实际使用代码混合语言的情况。

Method: 基于BigCodeBench，引入三种语言对的代码混合提示（Hinglish、Spanish-English、Chinese Pinyin-English），评估不同规模的LLM。

Result: 代码混合提示导致Pass@1性能下降，性能下降程度与模型规模及代码混合水平相关。

Conclusion: CodeMixBench为多语言代码生成提供了更真实的评估框架，并指出了构建鲁棒模型的新挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion,
debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as
HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only
prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers
often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap,
we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon
BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the
natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish
(Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We
comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models
ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts
consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only
counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for
smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for
studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and
directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well
across diverse linguistic settings.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，需要高效地从大型语言模型（LLM）中移除私有、受版权保护或有害数据的影响，但现有度量方法在语义相似内容、重新训练不实用或模型所有者可能绕过直接遗忘的情况下表现不佳。

Method: 利用鲁棒文本水印技术开发了WaterDrum度量方法，并引入了包含不同相似度数据的新基准数据集。

Result: WaterDrum能够克服现有方法的局限性，新数据集可用于严格评估遗忘算法。

Conclusion: WaterDrum为LLM遗忘提供了更准确的评估工具，新数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications
where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private,
copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric
unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the
extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and
retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from
scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can
improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the
LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs
called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these
limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that
contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously
evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are

Motivation: 现有离散数据生成方法要么嵌入连续空间，要么依赖近似变分损失，ItDPDM旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 通过泊松扩散过程直接操作离散空间，引入泊松重建损失（PRL），并证明其与真实负对数似然的精确关系。

Result: 在Lakh MIDI和CIFAR-10数据集上，ItDPDM显著降低测试NLL（高达80%），且收敛更快。

Conclusion: ItDPDM是一种高效且精确的离散数据生成方法，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic
music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete
inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only
approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have
individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian
diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still
perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the
Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which
simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete
state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival
processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss
(PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative
log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower
bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the
CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant
improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while
also achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: The comorbidities of hypertension impose a heavy burden on patients and

combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this
discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework
that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient

were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential
relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates
computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL
was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in
patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）面临通信资源有限、统计异质性和客户端参与不平衡等挑战，需要一种更高效的客户端选择方法。

Method: 采用去中心化的马尔可夫调度策略，客户端根据年龄依赖的选择概率独立管理参与，减少中心干预。

Result: 通过收敛证明和仿真实验，AoI方法在IID和非IID数据下分别提升7.5%和20%的收敛性能。

Conclusion: AoI调度策略可显著提升FL系统的可扩展性、公平性和效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data
privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients.
However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication
resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client
participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client
selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance
through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized
Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage
participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances
client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We
provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures
stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal
parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent
client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence
stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based
method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the
FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$
and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based
scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning
environments.

Result: USPR在多种PVRP基准测试中表现优异，灵活性和计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: USPR为PVRP提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，推动了相关研究。

Abstract: The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by
incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting
real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level
preferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown
promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from
poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution
instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR
(Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles
arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile
Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head
Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions
between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which
dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve
generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that
USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while
offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make
our source code publicly available to foster future research at

TL;DR: ADAC是一种新的离线强化学习方法，通过优势调制评估OOD动作，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL存在分布偏移问题，现有方法对所有OOD动作保守处理，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出ADAC方法，利用批量最优值函数评估OOD动作，定义优势函数调制Q函数更新。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中表现优异，尤其在挑战性任务上。

Conclusion: ADAC通过优势调制有效识别优质OOD动作，显著提升离线RL性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies
from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution
where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often
suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and
substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address
this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately
discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to
generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose
Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that
systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.
Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the
Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We
design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal
that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD
actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear
margins on the more challenging tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,
with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and
clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling
and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling
complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the
potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel
framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed
method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and
reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of
reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To
enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature
extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling
the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the
data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and
UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse
data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models
in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出通过排列LTH掩码以对齐新的优化盆地，显著提高了稀疏训练时的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LTH掩码在不同随机初始化下泛化性能差的问题，假设盆地未对齐是主要原因。

Method: 提出排列LTH掩码以对齐新的优化盆地，并在多个数据集和模型上验证。

Result: 实验表明，使用排列后的LTH掩码显著提高了泛化性能。

Conclusion: 排列LTH掩码是对齐优化盆地的有效方法，提升了稀疏训练的泛化能力。

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask
and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model
while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is
computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other
random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks
trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo
permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss
basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks
do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH
mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training
from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in
generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the
permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and
ResNet50).

Method: 使用结构化少样本学习任务（输入加整数k），通过优化方法定位关键注意力头，分析信号子空间。

Result: Llama-3-8B在任务中表现优异，信号集中在六维子空间，包含单位数字和整体幅度的信息。

Conclusion: 通过跟踪低维子空间，揭示了模型在少样本学习中的精细计算结构。

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from
individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule,
and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the
forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a
structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule
is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high
accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to
just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show
the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the
dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall
magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from
individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which
mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results
demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can
provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

TL;DR: FedTDP是一个隐私保护且统一的框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）在联邦环境中处理轨迹数据，解决了现有方法的隐私和通用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据质量受噪声和不完整性影响，现有轨迹数据准备（TDP）方法未解决隐私问题和缺乏通用性。

Method: 设计轨迹隐私自编码器保护隐私，引入轨迹知识增强器提升模型学习，提出联邦并行优化提高训练效率。

Result: 在6个真实数据集和10个TDP任务上，FedTDP优于13个先进基线方法。

Conclusion: FedTDP在隐私保护和通用性方面表现优异，为轨迹数据处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles
over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and
urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often
compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting
the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP)
can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i)
they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings
where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design
task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.
To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and
unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a
trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy,
(ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of
TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii)
propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by
reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on
6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP
consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一种新的决策问题——Bandit Max-Min Fair Allocation (BMMFA)，旨在通过重复分配不可分割物品最大化代理的最小效用。算法基于半强盗反馈和资源分配技术，提出了一个渐近遗憾上界和遗憾下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作假设物品价值在每轮开始时已知，而BMMFA问题中代理对物品的估值只能通过半强盗反馈观察，且奖励函数非加性，这为研究带来了新挑战。

Method: 结合强盗技术和竞争分析中的资源分配算法，提出了一种新算法，并分析了其渐近遗憾上界和下界。

Result: 算法实现了$O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$的遗憾上界，并证明了$\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$的遗憾下界。

Conclusion: 当时间范围$T$远大于代理数$n$时，上下界之间的差距仅为$T$的对数因子，表明算法性能接近理论最优。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a new decision-making problem called the bandit
max-min fair allocation (BMMFA) problem. The goal of this problem is to
maximize the minimum utility among agents with additive valuations by
repeatedly assigning indivisible goods to them. One key feature of this problem
is that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the
semi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are
provided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the
algorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most
bandit-setting problems.
  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic
regret bound of $O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the
number of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon. This
is based on a novel combination of bandit techniques and a resource allocation
algorithm studied in the literature on competitive analysis. Our second
contribution is to provide the regret lower bound of $\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$.
When $T$ is sufficiently larger than $n$, the gap between the upper and lower
bounds is a logarithmic factor of $T$.

TL;DR: 论文提出OpenworldAUC作为统一评估指标，并开发GMoP方法优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景需要模型处理未知领域输入，现有指标无法同时满足检测和分类需求。

Method: 提出OpenworldAUC指标和GMoP方法，通过动态平衡检测与分类优化性能。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，GMoP在OpenworldAUC等指标上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: OpenworldAUC和GMoP为开放世界任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks
with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates
model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen
classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to
handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has
spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified
evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or
new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).
What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric
should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find
that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to
satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose
OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and
classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC
effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs
domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection
and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under
practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show
GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release
the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为随机变分传播（SVP）的可扩展替代方法，通过分层变分推断重新定义训练，解决了反向传播（BP）的全局梯度同步问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）在深度学习中是基础，但其依赖全局梯度同步限制了可扩展性并增加了内存开销。

Method: SVP将层激活视为潜在变量，优化局部证据下界（ELBO），实现独立局部更新。为防止表示崩溃，使用固定随机矩阵将激活投影到低维空间，并结合特征对齐损失保持层间一致性。

Result: SVP在多种架构（MLPs、CNNs、Transformers）和数据集（MNIST到ImageNet）上达到与BP相当的精度，内存使用减少高达4倍，显著提升可扩展性。

Conclusion: SVP为深度表示学习引入了概率视角，为模块化和可解释的神经网络设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant
memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a
scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational
inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local
Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while
preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in
layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive
compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional
spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and
representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for
inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to
ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves
scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep
representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable
neural network design.

Result: 实验显示SIRA在七种最新水印方法上攻击成功率近100%，成本仅0.88美元/百万标记。

Conclusion: 当前水印算法存在普遍脆弱性，亟需设计更鲁棒的水印方法。

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by
controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling
watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified
model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor
in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed
watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we
reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing
a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic
efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA),
which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each
token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our
work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking
algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack
success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per
million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark
algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the
attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need
for more robust watermarking.

Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and
short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many
real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g.
latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias
assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the
observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are
typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper,
we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects
without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the
natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify
latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized
assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based
estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the
identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term
effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Result: 实验表明CUDA在真实数据集上显著优于现有CBM和域适应方法。

Conclusion: CUDA提升了CBMs的域适应能力，同时保持可解释性，为域适应设定了新基准。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining
predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that
training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails
under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization.
To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the
Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed
to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial
training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific
differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due
to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the
target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to
diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain
adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and
establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world
datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the radio resource allocation problem in a wireless
system with various integrated functionalities, such as communication, sensing
and computing. We design suitable resource management techniques that can
simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale
appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We
propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns
are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to
iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a
generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such
models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their
training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,
GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that
update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide
simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources
achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than
half of the number of acquisition rounds.

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) is a
challenging resource allocation problem in the field of AutoML. We propose
MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model
classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically
designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this
setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max
$k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We
theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML
benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.

Result: 在多个少样本表格学习基准测试中表现优异，成为该领域的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Latte通过训练时知识提取和兼容无监督预训练，显著提升少样本表格学习性能。

Abstract: Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with
a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to
addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot
tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on
test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or
text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge
extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to
optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general
knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion
of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with
existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available
unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an
extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot
tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte,
establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain

Motivation: 现有治疗效果估计算法在标注数据不足时表现受限，因标注成本高昂（如肿瘤影像或活检）。需在有限预算下获取高质量标注数据。

Result: FCCM在合成和半合成数据集上优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FCCM能有效降低风险上界，适用于实际数据分布，提升治疗效果估计效率。

Abstract: Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have
been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when
handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling
the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures
needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to
actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a
constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect
estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis
within the active learning context, where the derived key measures --
\textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk
upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction
algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To
generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which
transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and
\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius
reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other
baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

Abstract: Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users
from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data.
Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and
multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can
handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL
data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable
strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for
generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of
optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure
that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to
much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task
and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and
suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly.
Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks
in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing
surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive
experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance
consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5
MTL task-weighting strategies.

*Juhani Kivimäki,Jakub Białek,Wojtek Kuberski,Jukka K. Nurminen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CBPE的新方法，用于估计二元分类器的性能指标（如准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数），无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型监控依赖真实标签，但标签获取困难或延迟高，限制了性能监控的可行性。现有方法仅关注准确率，忽略了其他重要指标。

Method: CBPE将混淆矩阵元素视为随机变量，利用模型的校准置信度估计其分布，进而推导目标指标的概率分布。

Result: CBPE能提供强理论保证和有效置信区间的性能估计。

Conclusion: CBPE填补了无标签情况下多指标性能估计的空白，具有理论和实用价值。

Abstract: Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle,
safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after
deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground
truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in
unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible.
Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models
without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are
various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model
performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has
received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we
address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any
binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular,
we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and
F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion
matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the
model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated
as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from
the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come
with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.

*Yuhui Xu,Hanze Dong,Lei Wang,Doyen Sahoo,Junnan Li,Caiming Xiong*

TL;DR: Elastic Reasoning框架通过将推理分为思考和解两阶段，并独立分配预算，显著提升了在严格资源约束下的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务上表现优异，但输出长度不可控，难以满足实际部署中的严格资源约束。

Method: 提出Elastic Reasoning框架，将推理分为思考和解两阶段，并引入轻量级预算约束策略，训练模型适应截断思考。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Elastic Reasoning在严格预算约束下表现稳健，且训练成本更低。

Conclusion: Elastic Reasoning为可控推理提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex
tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their
uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are
strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for
scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two
phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test
time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,
significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train
models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight
budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the
model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and
generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional
training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming
(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning
performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring
significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our
approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in
unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical
solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

Result: 理论改进样本复杂度依赖关系，实验显示在多个数据集上优于基线。

Conclusion: LLP在理论和实践上均取得进展，为部分信息学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a partial information
setting where examples in a training set are grouped into bags, and only
aggregate label values in each bag are available. Despite the partial
observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of
individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under
square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an
algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk
Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc
variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in
important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the
sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our
algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical
performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.

Conclusion: DIFF-FLOOD是一种高效且可扩展的沿海洪水预测方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast
and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this
problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting
method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts
inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into
account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital
elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time
window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context.
Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed
to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested
DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a
region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD
outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6%
to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.

Motivation: 传统斜决策树因计算复杂度高未被广泛研究，CART-ELC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CART-ELC算法在受限超平面集合上进行穷举搜索以构建斜决策树。

Result: 在小数据集上分类准确率显著提升，且生成的树更浅、更易解释。

Conclusion: CART-ELC在性能和可解释性上优于现有决策树算法。

Abstract: Oblique decision trees have attracted attention due to their potential for
improved classification performance over traditional axis-aligned decision
trees. However, methods that rely on exhaustive search to find oblique splits
face computational challenges. As a result, they have not been widely explored.
We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive

performs an exhaustive search on a restricted set of hyperplanes. We then
investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive
capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves
competitive performance on small datasets, often yielding statistically
significant improvements in classification accuracy relative to existing
decision tree induction algorithms, while frequently producing shallower,
simpler, and thus more interpretable trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锐度度量方法对Transformer效果不佳，因其注意力机制中存在丰富的对称性，导致参数空间方向上的网络或损失函数保持不变。

Method: 在商流形上重新定义锐度，利用黎曼几何工具提出广义锐度概念，并通过近似测地线实现。

Result: 实验表明，高阶近似测地线的锐度度量与泛化能力有强相关性，适用于文本和图像分类任务。

Conclusion: 通过考虑Transformer的对称性，新锐度定义显著提升了与泛化能力的相关性。

Abstract: The concept of sharpness has been successfully applied to traditional
architectures like MLPs and CNNs to predict their generalization. For
transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness
and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for
transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention
mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or
its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these
symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from
quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities.
Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of
sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient
manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing
so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we
demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation
with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic
data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for
real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DPQ-HD的后训练压缩算法，用于高效压缩超维计算（HDC）系统，无需重新训练即可接近浮点性能，显著降低计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HDC应用依赖高精度模型或编码矩阵，导致计算和内存需求高，而现有压缩方法通常需要重新训练，成本高且不实用。

Method: 结合分解、剪枝和量化三种压缩技术，提出DPQ-HD算法，并引入基于余弦相似度的渐进评估和提前退出策略以加速推理。

Result: 在图像和图形分类任务中，内存减少20-100倍，精度仅下降1-2%，且优于现有后训练压缩方法，优化时间减少100倍，推理速度提升56倍。

Conclusion: DPQ-HD是一种高效、实用的HDC压缩方案，适用于资源受限的边缘设备，性能接近浮点模型且无需重新训练。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is emerging as a promising approach for edge
AI, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current
HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding
matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant
computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While
recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase
the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them
expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post
Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD),
which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating
point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational
and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression
techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we
introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates
similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce
the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy.
We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image
and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to
uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing
post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with
retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less
overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a
microcontroller

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在数据同化中存在局限性，强化学习的序列决策框架更适合动态平衡模型预测与观测。

Method: RL-DAUNCE通过代理模拟集合成员、量化不确定性、强制物理约束（如对偶优化和动作空间限制）来提升数据同化。

Result: RL-DAUNCE在Madden-Julian Oscillation案例中表现优于标准EnKF，匹配约束EnKF性能且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RL-DAUNCE结合物理约束与强化学习，显著提升数据同化效果，适用于复杂非高斯现象。

Abstract: Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation.
While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning
(RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework,
which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically
balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new
RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints
through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational
efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to
mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second,
RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble
members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's
ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints
during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state
estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is
developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward
function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process.
Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space.
Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing
efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an
intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian
features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the
violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance
of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing
extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially
less computational effort.

Result: 在5个模拟和3个真实任务中，D-CODA表现优于基线方法，展示了其在数据增强中的潜力。

Conclusion: D-CODA为双机械臂模仿学习提供了一种有效的离线数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits
such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop
and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing
frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations,
highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we
introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs)
framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and
decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks
using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including
Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop
performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the
interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance
of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a
strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected
edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are
boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of
Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and
high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms
is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on
enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible
alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to
autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the
specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict
task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial
arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate
large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic
environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We
do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts
which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3)
poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using
reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or
inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even
when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables
goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales
across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search
strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and
simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five
diverse environments. Website with videos, code, data, and model weights:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专家-代理切换系统难以精确选择监督时机，且切换会导致动作突变，破坏动态稳定性。

Method: 1. 添加正则化激活监督时机阈值；2. 将切换系统转为多动作候选的最优共识系统；3. 引入自回归有色噪声保持探索一致性。

Result: 仿真验证表明，学习策略在交互中既鲁棒又保持动态稳定性。

Conclusion: CubeDAgger在提升鲁棒性的同时有效解决了动态稳定性问题。

Abstract: Interactive imitation learning makes an agent's control policy robust by
stepwise supervisions from an expert. The recent algorithms mostly employ
expert-agent switching systems to reduce the expert's burden by limitedly
selecting the supervision timing. However, the precise selection is difficult
and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic
stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger,
which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making
three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement
adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the
supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to
an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third,
autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the
stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by
simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while
maintaining dynamic stability during interaction.

<details>

Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量标注的专家数据，成本高昂且限制了训练规模。利用无标签观察数据（如视频演示）学习潜在动作标签是一种有前景的解决方案。

Method: 设计了CLAM模型，采用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，并联合训练动作解码器，确保潜在动作空间能轻松映射到真实动作。

Result: 在DMControl（运动）和MetaWorld（操作）基准测试及真实WidowX机器人上，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提高了2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM无需专家标注数据即可学习高性能策略，为复杂连续控制任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot
arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,
remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best
baseline. Videos and code can be found at clamrobot.github.io.

Abstract: Large-scale construction and demolition significantly challenge long-term
place recognition (PR) by drastically reshaping urban and suburban
environments. Existing datasets predominantly reflect limited or indoor-focused
changes, failing to adequately represent extensive outdoor transformations. To
bridge this gap, we introduce the City that Never Settles (CNS) dataset, a
simulation-based dataset created using the CARLA simulator, capturing major
structural changes-such as building construction and demolition-across diverse
maps and sequences. Additionally, we propose TCR_sym, a symmetric version of
the original TCR metric, enabling consistent measurement of structural changes
irrespective of source-target ordering. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate
that CNS encompasses more extensive transformations than current real-world
benchmarks. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LiDAR-based PR methods on CNS

*Hendrik Surmann,Jorge de Heuvel,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多目标强化学习（MORL）的方法，用于自动驾驶的动态驾驶风格偏好适应，无需重新训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类驾驶风格多样，现有自动驾驶方法难以动态适应用户偏好，影响信任和满意度。

Method: 使用MORL和偏好驱动优化，将偏好编码为连续权重向量，调整效率、舒适度、速度和激进性等目标。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中，单策略代理能动态适应驾驶风格偏好，同时保持避碰和路线完成性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持动态、上下文相关的驾驶风格偏好，提升用户体验。

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style.
Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust
and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on
predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation,
limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We
propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that
enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are
encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable
style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and
aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our
single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic
scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA
simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts
its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining
performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

TL;DR: SYMDEX是一个利用机器人双边对称性的强化学习框架，用于训练双手灵巧操作任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能轻松实现左右手动作镜像，而机器人也应具备类似能力以实现灵巧操作。

Result: 在模拟和实际任务中表现优异，尤其在复杂任务中显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 对称性作为归纳偏置能提升样本效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.
Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit
this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor
a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute
ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce
SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for
ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral
symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation
tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By
exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from
one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the
subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated
manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of
them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the
left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's
scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our
symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and
coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias
in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization
across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for
datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel
quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset,
which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical
features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with
quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical
optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to
reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed
values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature
distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This
approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement,
including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values >
0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also
eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of
imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable
classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation
tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and
integrity are crucial.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for
specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open
question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether,
and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent
progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning
abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In
this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating
Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native
tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation
directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically
structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can
learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of
quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like
LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2
outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit
reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a
prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and
modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for
GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable
classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the
limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research,
and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome
classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously
prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension
transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit
worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data
dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through
diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving
posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of
posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the
joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for
quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit
using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable
classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution
learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,
eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate
the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions
compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new
theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage
in joint distribution learning.

Conclusion: 该量子算法为复杂分布采样提供了新的高效工具。

Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta
V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is
non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical
methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce
the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of
continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes
the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as
the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten
Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value
thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to
the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this
framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates
replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from
complex, rugged energy landscapes.

Abstract: Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges,
have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social
systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the
encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the
establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we
demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs
to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems,
thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model
based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple
hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges
exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge
formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge
internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This
model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of
arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges
between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its
performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model
in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge
prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple
hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph
in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and
flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the
understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.

Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material
microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical
properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are
computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and
manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that
combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to
efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial
and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain
structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a
novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural
Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural
integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated
that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to
\SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to
approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The
best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of
\SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All
models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size
distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for
applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming,
potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using
evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and
decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use
layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of
these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in
more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained
models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and
scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a
population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one
autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators
transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided
pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance
proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where
constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in
randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by
expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform
randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning
according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and
schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

Abstract: Regression-based predictive analytics used in modern kidney transplantation
is known to inherit biases from training data. This leads to social
discrimination and inefficient organ utilization, particularly in the context
of a few social groups. Despite this concern, there is limited research on
fairness in regression and its impact on organ utilization and placement. This
paper introduces three novel divergence-based group fairness notions: (i)
independence, (ii) separation, and (iii) sufficiency to assess the fairness of
regression-based analytics tools. In addition, fairness preferences are
investigated from crowd feedback, in order to identify a socially accepted
group fairness criterion for evaluating these tools. A total of 85 participants
were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and a Mixed-Logit
discrete choice model was used to model fairness feedback and estimate social
fairness preferences. The findings clearly depict a strong preference towards
the separation and sufficiency fairness notions, and that the predictive
analytics is deemed fair with respect to gender and race groups, but unfair in
terms of age groups.

Method: 通过分析弹性力学和热传导中的约束力影响，提出了“显式约束力方法”（ECFM）来控制约束引入的源项。

Result: 结果表明，ECFM能提供更可预测和可定制的重建结果，即使在物理模型不一致的情况下。

Conclusion: 结论是ECFM方法通过满足三个基本标准，显著提升了PINNs在复杂场景中的适用性和可靠性。

Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution
reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical
system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the
system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression
problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the
parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical
phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming
consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches
may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and
data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of
the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend
strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations,
the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity
and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss
and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data
lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source
terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can
significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially
substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint
enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint
force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the
constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability,
robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and
customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the
parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured
system.

Conclusion: Att-ClassiGAN通过注意力机制有效解决了CMI的计算瓶颈，提升了图像重建和分类性能。

Abstract: Computational microwave imaging (CMI) has gained attention as an alternative
technique for conventional microwave imaging techniques, addressing their
limitations such as hardware-intensive physical layer and slow data collection
acquisition speed to name a few. Despite these advantages, CMI still encounters
notable computational bottlenecks, especially during the image reconstruction
stage. In this setting, both image recovery and object classification present
significant processing demands. To address these challenges, our previous work
introduced ClassiGAN, which is a generative deep learning model designed to
simultaneously reconstruct images and classify targets using only
back-scattered signals. In this study, we build upon that framework by
incorporating attention gate modules into ClassiGAN. These modules are intended
to refine feature extraction and improve the identification of relevant
information. By dynamically focusing on important features and suppressing
irrelevant ones, the attention mechanism enhances the overall model
performance. The proposed architecture, named Att-ClassiGAN, significantly
reduces the reconstruction time compared to traditional CMI approaches.
Furthermore, it outperforms current advanced methods, delivering improved
Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), higher Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM), and better classification outcomes for the reconstructed targets.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了自动化睡眠分析的可行性，结合睡眠分期和纺锤波检测，验证其在双相情感障碍研究中的效果，结果显示自动化方法能快速复制专家研究的关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化睡眠分析可减少人为差异并支持大规模研究，但目前多步骤自动化分析的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠分期和SUMOv2进行纺锤波检测，完全自动化分析双相情感障碍数据。

Result: 自动化分析在几分钟内复制了专家耗时数月的结果，尽管定量存在差异，但模型性能达到或超过人工评分一致性。

Conclusion: 全自动化方法有望推动大规模睡眠研究，并公开了相关工具和隐私保护平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

TL;DR: 论文分析了人工神经网络中的‘虚构’现象，特别是储层计算机（RCs）中未训练吸引子（UAs）的作用及其对学习系统的影响。

Motivation: 理解人工神经网络中‘虚构’现象（如未训练吸引子的生成）的机制，为学习系统的局限性提供基础性见解。

Method: 通过分析储层计算机（RCs）的动态系统行为，研究未训练吸引子（UAs）在重构失败时的作用及其对吸引子间过渡的影响。

Result: 发现未训练吸引子是学习系统的固有特征，尤其是在状态空间受限的情况下，且这种现象可能不仅限于RCs。

Conclusion: 未训练吸引子是学习系统的一种普遍现象，表明‘虚构’可能是更广泛系统中存在的机制。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to
innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how
elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information
without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To
provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation
occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.
RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a
well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given
attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to
construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on
the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when
modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results,
we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state
spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in
systems beyond RCs.

Result: 学习到的基函数能准确近似算子作用，并提供几乎不变的有限维子空间，成功提取了估计算子的谱特性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了动态自适应基函数的有效性，为复杂动力系统的分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing
complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a
deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these
operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent
behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging.
We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational
learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient
finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal,
locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system.
This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the
operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We
illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral
properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive
quality of the machine-learned basis.

Result: 模型有效去除水印和噪声，无需成对数据。

Conclusion: SSH-Net为水印去除提供了一种实用且高效的自监督解决方案。

Abstract: Visible watermark removal is challenging due to its inherent complexities and
the noise carried within images. Existing methods primarily rely on supervised
learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and
watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and
Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net
synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in
a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task.
The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a
lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle
the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise,
incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture
intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared
CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common
features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: 多维风险评估对于实现安全可靠的AI驱动对话系统至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has
enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However,
these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that
extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we
propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously
evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing
organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the
technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the
chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection
attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age
range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak,
an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance
Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code
hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our
methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores
guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design

assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational

Motivation: 现有DNN水印方案易受水印移除和模糊攻击，且水印存在判定标准模糊。

Result: 实验表明ChainMarks在鲁棒性和安全性上优于现有方案，且水印存在概率更高。

Conclusion: ChainMarks为DNN模型提供了更安全、更可靠的水印保护方案。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic
watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of
model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking
schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the
vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the
likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking
scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by
introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a
two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,
ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly
applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated
with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.
Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the
original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted
labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a
more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability
of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher
levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking
schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher
probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level
of watermark accuracy.

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks
that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of
3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure
comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the
neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's
neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a
Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing
the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both
monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D

Result: CNN 在分类性能上显著优于单幅图像分类（提升达 12%），且效率更高；通过学习多路复用技术，减少数据量同时保持分类准确率。

Conclusion: 直接分类 FPM 测量数据是一种高效且性能优越的方法，适用于医学细胞分类等应用。

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)
enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an
extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical
applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even
hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide
field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying
the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a
reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can
extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly
outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)
while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a
high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing
of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy
while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)
significantly.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a pivotal task within the realms of medical

accurately segmenting major regions of interest, the precise segmentation of
boundary areas remains challenging. In this study, we propose a novel network
architecture named CTO, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Vision Transformer (ViT) models, and explicit edge detection operators to
tackle this challenge. CTO surpasses existing methods in terms of segmentation
accuracy and strikes a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, without
the need for additional data inputs or label injections. Specifically, CTO
adheres to the canonical encoder-decoder network paradigm, with a dual-stream
encoder network comprising a mainstream CNN stream for capturing local features
and an auxiliary StitchViT stream for integrating long-range dependencies.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn boundary areas, we
introduce a boundary-guided decoder network that employs binary boundary masks
generated by dedicated edge detection operators to provide explicit guidance
during the decoding process. We validate the performance of CTO through
extensive experiments conducted on seven challenging medical image segmentation
datasets, namely ISIC 2016, PH2, ISIC 2018, CoNIC, LiTS17, and BTCV. Our

Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised, motion-resolved reconstruction framework
for high-resolution, free-breathing pulmonary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
utilizing a three-dimensional Gaussian representation (3DGS). The proposed
method leverages 3DGS to address the challenges of motion-resolved 3D isotropic
pulmonary MRI reconstruction by enabling data smoothing between voxels for
continuous spatial representation. Pulmonary MRI data acquisition is performed
using a golden-angle radial sampling trajectory, with respiratory motion
signals extracted from the center of k-space in each radial spoke. Based on the
estimated motion signal, the k-space data is sorted into multiple respiratory
phases. A 3DGS framework is then applied to reconstruct a reference image
volume from the first motion state. Subsequently, a patient-specific
convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the deformation vector
fields (DVFs), which are used to generate the remaining motion states through
spatial transformation of the reference volume. The proposed reconstruction
pipeline is evaluated on six datasets from six subjects and bench-marked
against three state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. The experimental
findings demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction framework effectively
reconstructs high-resolution, motion-resolved pulmonary MR images. Compared
with existing approaches, it achieves superior image quality, reflected by
higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio. The proposed
unsupervised 3DGS-based reconstruction method enables accurate motion-resolved
pulmonary MRI with isotropic spatial resolution. Its superior performance in
image quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods highlights its potential as
a robust solution for clinical pulmonary MR imaging.

Conclusion: 开源数据集和方法为AD研究提供了透明和可重复的工具，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
amyloid-beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, which serve as key
histopathological features. The identification and segmentation of these
lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due
to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining
variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful
tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is
significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics,
necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this
study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset
(ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of
dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We
establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep
learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper
insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we
propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy,
particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and
mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and
segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring
transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the

TL;DR: 自监督学习（SSL）在视网膜影像中验证了ViTs的泛化能力，发现自然图像预训练的iBOT表现优于领域特定模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在视网膜影像任务中，领域内预训练是否必要。

Method: 在7个DFI数据集（共70,000张图像）上测试6种SSL预训练的ViTs，用于AMD识别。

Result: iBOT在自然图像上预训练表现最佳（AUROC 0.80-0.97），优于领域特定模型（0.78-0.96）和无预训练基线（0.68-0.91）。

Conclusion: 自然图像预训练的ViTs在AMD识别中表现优异，挑战了领域内预训练的必要性。同时发布了巴西AMD数据集BRAMD。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing
their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models
pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the
benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we
benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets
totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that
iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution
generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of
foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption
that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an
open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RepSNet是一种基于核边界回归和结构重参数化的神经网络模型，用于H&E染色组织病理图像中的核分割和分类，解决了计算效率和重叠目标处理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理诊断是肿瘤诊断的金标准，核实例分割是数字病理分析和病理诊断的关键步骤，但计算效率和重叠目标处理是主要挑战。

Method: RepSNet通过估计每个像素的父核边界位置信息（BPI），结合局部和上下文信息，利用边界投票机制（BVM）聚合BPI，并通过结构重参数化技术减少参数和计算负担。

Result: 实验表明，RepSNet在多个典型基准模型上表现出优越性。

Conclusion: RepSNet通过宏观信息引导的边界决策和结构重参数化技术，显著提升了核分割的准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for tumor diagnosis, and nucleus
instance segmentation is a key step in digital pathology analysis and
pathological diagnosis. However, the computational efficiency of the model and
the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of
this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on
a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for
segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images.
First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent
nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information
of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the
nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels
using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation
results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected
component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of
synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore,
different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus
boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its
boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using
an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable
encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some
receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy
improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in
the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique.
Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to
several typical benchmark models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种CT引导的多剂量自适应注意力去噪扩散模型（MDAA-Diff），用于多剂量PET去噪，结合解剖学指导和剂量水平适应，显著提升了低剂量条件下的去噪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高剂量放射性示踪剂会增加辐射风险，而现有研究多关注单剂量去噪，忽略了患者间剂量响应差异和CT图像的解剖学约束。

Method: 采用CT引导的高频小波注意力模块（HWA）提取解剖边界特征，并通过自适应加权融合机制增强PET图像边缘细节；提出剂量自适应注意力模块（DAA）动态整合剂量水平。

Result: 在18F-FDG和68Ga-FAPI数据集上的实验表明，MDAA-Diff在低剂量条件下优于现有方法，保持了诊断质量。

Conclusion: MDAA-Diff通过解剖学指导和剂量适应机制，显著提升了多剂量PET去噪的性能，代码已公开。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images requires
administering high-dose radiotracers, which increases radiation exposure risks.
Generating standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) has become a
potential solution. However, previous studies have primarily focused on single
low-dose PET denoising, neglecting two critical factors: discrepancies in dose
response caused by inter-patient variability, and complementary anatomical
constraints derived from CT images. In this work, we propose a novel CT-Guided
Multi-dose Adaptive Attention Denoising Diffusion Model (MDAA-Diff) for
multi-dose PET denoising. Our approach integrates anatomical guidance and
dose-level adaptation to achieve superior denoising performance under low-dose
conditions. Specifically, this approach incorporates a CT-Guided High-frequency
Wavelet Attention (HWA) module, which uses wavelet transforms to separate
high-frequency anatomical boundary features from CT images. These extracted
features are then incorporated into PET imaging through an adaptive weighted
fusion mechanism to enhance edge details. Additionally, we propose the
Dose-Adaptive Attention (DAA) module, a dose-conditioned enhancement mechanism
that dynamically integrates dose levels into channel-spatial attention weight
calculation. Extensive experiments on 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI datasets
demonstrate that MDAA-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
preserving diagnostic quality under reduced-dose conditions. Our code is
publicly available.

Abstract: Early detection and accurate diagnosis are essential to improving patient
outcomes. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor detection
has shown promise, but existing models often suffer from overparameterization,
which limits their performance gains. In this study, fuzzy sigmoid convolution
(FSC) is introduced along with two additional modules: top-of-the-funnel and
middle-of-the-funnel. The proposed methodology significantly reduces the number
of trainable parameters without compromising classification accuracy. A novel
convolutional operator is central to this approach, effectively dilating the
receptive field while preserving input data integrity. This enables efficient
feature map reduction and enhances the model's tumor detection capability. In
the FSC-based model, fuzzy sigmoid activation functions are incorporated within
convolutional layers to improve feature extraction and classification. The
inclusion of fuzzy logic into the architecture improves its adaptability and
robustness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superior performance and efficiency of the proposed model. The FSC-based
architecture achieved classification accuracies of 99.17%, 99.75%, and 99.89%
on three different datasets. The model employs 100 times fewer parameters than
large-scale transfer learning architectures, highlighting its computational
efficiency and suitability for detecting brain tumors early. This research
offers lightweight, high-performance deep-learning models for medical imaging
applications.

Conclusion: 通过增加模型犯错机会，使其从中学习，最终提高了息肉检测的准确性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers today, but it can be
prevented through early detection of malignant polyps in the colon, primarily
via colonoscopies. While this method has saved many lives, human error remains
a significant challenge, as missing a polyp could have fatal consequences for
the patient. Deep learning (DL) polyp detectors offer a promising solution.
However, existing DL polyp detectors often mistake white light reflections from
the endoscope for polyps, which can lead to false positives.To address this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that
artificially adds more white light reflections to create harder training
scenarios. Specifically, we first generate a bank of artificial lights using
the training dataset. Then we find the regions of the training images that we
should not add these artificial lights on. Finally, we propose a sliding window
method to add the artificial light to the areas that fit of the training
images, resulting in augmented images. By providing the model with more
opportunities to make mistakes, we hypothesize that it will also have more
chances to learn from those mistakes, ultimately improving its performance in
polyp detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our new
data augmentation method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频编解码器仅依赖时间参考，导致处理大运动或新物体时表现不佳。

Method: 提出SEVC，利用低分辨率视频作为空间参考，生成增强运动向量和混合时空上下文，并引入空间引导的潜在先验。

Result: SEVC显著提升大运动或新物体处理能力，比特率降低11.9%，并提供额外低分辨率比特流。

Conclusion: SEVC通过时空结合优化，显著提升视频编解码性能。

Abstract: Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate
temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to
handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned
latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video
Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial
references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to
generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts.
Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the
prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by
multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint
spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for
spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental
results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling
large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the
previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution
bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童年龄估计因生理变化细微且缺乏纵向数据集而具有挑战性，现有研究多关注成人面部特征，儿童眼周和虹膜区域研究较少。

Method: 使用包含21,000多张近红外图像的纵向数据集，采用多任务深度学习框架进行年龄预测和年龄组分类。

Result: 眼周模型表现更优，平均绝对误差1.33年，分类准确率83.82%，且模型在不同传感器上表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究表明儿童眼周图像可用于可靠年龄估计，为儿童生物识别系统设计提供了基础，并适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Estimating a child's age from ocular biometric images is challenging due to
subtle physiological changes and the limited availability of longitudinal
datasets. Although most biometric age estimation studies have focused on facial
features and adult subjects, pediatric-specific analysis, particularly of the
iris and periocular regions, remains relatively unexplored. This study presents
a comparative evaluation of iris and periocular images for estimating the ages
of children aged between 4 and 16 years. We utilized a longitudinal dataset
comprising more than 21,000 near-infrared (NIR) images, collected from 288
pediatric subjects over eight years using two different imaging sensors. A
multi-task deep learning framework was employed to jointly perform age
prediction and age-group classification, enabling a systematic exploration of
how different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, particularly
those adapted for non-square ocular inputs, capture the complex variability
inherent in pediatric eye images. The results show that periocular models
consistently outperform iris-based models, achieving a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 1.33 years and an age-group classification accuracy of 83.82%. These
results mark the first demonstration that reliable age estimation is feasible
from children's ocular images, enabling privacy-preserving age checks in
child-centric applications. This work establishes the first longitudinal
benchmark for pediatric ocular age estimation, providing a foundation for
designing robust, child-focused biometric systems. The developed models proved
resilient across different imaging sensors, confirming their potential for
real-world deployment. They also achieved inference speeds of less than 10
milliseconds per image on resource-constrained VR headsets, demonstrating their
suitability for real-time applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于输入凸神经网络（ICNN）的两阶段随机规划方法（ICNN-enhanced 2SP），通过利用线性规划（LP）的可表示性，显著提高了计算效率，同时保持了解决方案的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两阶段随机规划（2SP）在不确定性决策建模中具有广泛应用，但其计算复杂性限制了可扩展性。现有方法如Neur2SP依赖混合整数规划（MIP），计算成本高。

Method: 采用输入凸神经网络（ICNNs）作为替代函数，通过架构强制凸性，利用线性规划（LP）实现精确推断，避免传统MIP中的整数变量需求。

Result: 实验表明，ICNN-enhanced 2SP在保持验证精度的同时，显著提高了求解速度，尤其在问题规模较大时，速度提升可达100倍。

Conclusion: ICNN-enhanced 2SP为两阶段随机规划提供了一种高效且精确的替代方案，特别适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling
decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to
the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing
learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP)
employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on
computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We
propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks
(ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP
problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference
through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to
the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of
the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more
computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality.
Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer
training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based
counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits
considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while
preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more
pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the
method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to
MIP-based formulations.

Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing
mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief
description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th
International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software
(ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy,
France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad
(Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers
was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have
been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in
the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful
representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused
on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible
applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications,
in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the
volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the
development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve
the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and
stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of
the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the
30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th -

Conclusion: 本文扩展了因果效应的分析框架，为研究其分布和关系提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for
characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics
such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product
moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between
multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal
inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the
difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect
assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides
definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product
moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We
conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal
effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a
real-world medical dataset.

Abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a
fundamental framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment
in provoking an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary
objectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into
path-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific
probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into
path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and
outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for
decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from
finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world
educational dataset.

Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.

Method: 采用数据驱动方法，从EHR数据中提取概率独立的潜在变量，构建因果图，并训练随机森林模型预测CS风险。

Result: 模型表现出良好准确性（ROC 0.771），识别了前10个最具预测性的风险因素，其中药物干预是最重要的风险降低因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了药物干预对降低CS风险的关键作用，并发现过敏性鼻炎可能是CS的潜在诱因。

Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the
lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains
poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this
associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract
probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data
and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These
sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph
constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our
population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these
sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most
predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that
pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS
risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as
a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.

both the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical
performance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin
Method and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their
empirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of
sampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and
(iv) the number of nodes per layer. For the TDGF, we also consider the order of
the discretization scheme and the number of time steps.

*Mohit Chaudhary,Chirag Jain,Preethu Rose Anish*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了利用ChatGPT进行零样本学习，将应用评论分类为功能需求、非功能需求、两者兼具或无关类别，并在1880条手动标注的评论数据集上评估其性能，F1分数达0.842。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应用评论是用户反馈的重要来源，但传统分类方法依赖大量领域特定数据，成本高且耗时。研究旨在探索ChatGPT在零样本学习中的潜力，以高效分类评论。

Method: 使用ChatGPT进行零样本学习，对来自10个不同应用的1880条手动标注评论进行分类，并评估其性能。同时分析评论可读性和长度对分类准确性的影响。

Result: ChatGPT在评论分类中表现稳健，F1分数为0.842，但存在一些挑战和局限性。某些评论类别更容易被误分类。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在零样本学习下能有效分类应用评论，为开发决策提供支持，但仍需改进以应对特定挑战。

Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable
insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user
experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app
development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction.
Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a
pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features
(functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes,
such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements).
Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional
approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large,
domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate.
This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for
classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement,
non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance
on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse
apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves
a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges
and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review
readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual
analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.

### [267] [PR2: Peephole Raw Pointer Rewriting with LLMs for Translating C to Safer Rust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04852)
*Yifei Gao,Chengpeng Wang,Pengxiang Huang,Xuwei Liu,Mingwei Zheng,Xiangyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PR2的技术，通过消除C2RUST生成的Rust代码中的原始指针，提升内存安全性。PR2使用决策树提示和代码变更分析，成功减少了13.22%的原始指针，平均每个项目耗时5.44小时，成本1.46美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Rust的内存和线程安全特性，将C代码转换为Rust代码的需求增加，但现有工具生成的Rust代码依赖不安全结构（如原始指针），削弱了Rust的安全性。

Method: PR2采用窥孔原始指针重写技术，将函数中的原始指针提升为适当的Rust数据结构，并结合决策树提示和代码变更分析修复错误。

Result: 在28个真实C项目中，PR2成功消除了13.22%的本地原始指针，显著提升了Rust代码的安全性，平均每个项目耗时5.44小时，成本1.46美元。

Conclusion: PR2有效提升了C到Rust转换代码的安全性，为未来工具改进提供了方向。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's
robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable
syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code.
However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe
constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety
guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs
generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a
peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual
functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs
decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.
Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors
introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during
compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and
evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show
that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these
projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On
average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an
average cost of $1.46.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文综述了181个CodeLLMs和智能体的基准测试，发现当前测试在软件开发生命周期（SDLC）各阶段覆盖不均衡，主要集中在开发阶段，而需求工程和设计阶段关注较少。Python是主导语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补CodeLLMs和智能体基准测试缺乏全面综述的空白，评估其能力并指导未来发展。

Method: 分析461篇相关论文中的181个基准测试，覆盖SDLC各阶段。

Result: 60%基准测试关注开发阶段，需求工程和设计阶段仅占5%和3%。Python是主要语言。

Conclusion: 当前研究存在不平衡，需缩小CodeLLMs和智能体理论能力与实际应用的差距。

Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in
tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software
engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can
flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking
plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents,
guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing
significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for
CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive
review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing
181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the
software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance
in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the
software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software
design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively.
Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the
reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current
research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the
theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in
real-world scenarios.

### [269] [Toward Holistic Evaluation of Recommender Systems Powered by Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06667)
*Yashar Deldjoo,Nikhil Mehta,Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy,Shuai Zhang,Pablo Castells,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了生成模型驱动的推荐系统（Gen-RecSys）的评估挑战，提出了分类和新评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成推荐系统能提供更丰富的用户体验，但也带来新风险，传统评估指标无法全面衡量这些挑战。

Method: 将评估挑战分为两类：现有问题的加剧和新风险；提出基于场景和多指标的综合评估方法。

Result: 提出了一个框架，帮助研究者和从业者全面评估Gen-RecSys，确保个性化和负责任部署。

Conclusion: 论文为生成推荐系统的评估提供了新视角和方法，强调综合评估的重要性。

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond
classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously
unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these
systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and
multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown
territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private
information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these
challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or
alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation
challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are
exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new
risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we
propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments
and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias
detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so
researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring
effective personalization and responsible deployment.

### [270] [QBD-RankedDataGen: Generating Custom Ranked Datasets for Improving Query-By-Document Search Using LLM-Reranking with Reduced Human Effort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04732)
*Sriram Gopalakrishnan,Sunandita Patra*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成自定义QBD搜索数据集的方法（QBD-RankedDatagen），并比较了多种方法在成本、速度和与领域专家交互方面的表现，显著减少了人工工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索方法需要领域特定数据集优化，但创建这些数据集成本高且耗时。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文档评分和排名，并结合专家输入，优化BM25模型参数。

Result: 在TREC的QBD数据集上评估，显著减少了人工工作量并保留了足够的专家知识。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能高效生成QBD搜索数据集，适用于专利匹配、法律检索等任务。

Abstract: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem is an information retrieval problem where
the query is a document, and the retrieved candidates are documents that match
the query document, often in a domain or query specific manner. This can be
crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval,
and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword
search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets
to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific
datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to
generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in
this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative
analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human
interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce
document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The
process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human
effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient
expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD
datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters
of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines
like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献数量激增导致信息利用率低、重复工作和跨学科合作受限，需要高效工具提升LLMs处理能力。

Method: 结合HPC的HiPerRAG工作流，使用Oreo解析多模态文档，ColTrast通过对比学习和延迟交互优化检索编码。

Result: 在SciQ和PubMedQA基准测试中分别达到90%和76%准确率，优于PubMedGPT和GPT-4。

Conclusion: HiPerRAG通过大规模RAG工作流整合科学知识，推动跨学科创新。

Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to
underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary
collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist
scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions
of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational
costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as
well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the
nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce
HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index
and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its
core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and
ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval
accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques.
HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering
benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90%
accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models
like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs
on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million
document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering
interdisciplinary innovation.

### [272] [Prompt-Based LLMs for Position Bias-Aware Reranking in Personalized Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04948)
*Md Aminul Islam,Ahmed Sayeed Faruk*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合传统推荐模型和大语言模型（LLM）的混合框架，用于重排推荐结果，并研究了LLM在推荐系统中的局限性，如上下文窗口限制、位置偏差等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在推荐系统中表现出潜力，但其存在上下文窗口限制、位置偏差等问题，需要进一步研究和改进。

Method: 提出混合框架，结合传统推荐模型和LLM，通过结构化提示重排推荐结果，并评估用户历史记录重排和指令提示对位置偏差的影响。

Result: 实验表明，随机化用户历史记录能提升排序质量，但LLM重排未超越基础模型；明确指令对减少位置偏差无效。

Conclusion: LLM在建模排序上下文和减少偏差方面存在局限性，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across
digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to
their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training.
However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window
size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling
listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to
position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless
of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM
for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of
user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias.
Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves
ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model.
Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our
evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and
mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.

*Mingruo Yuan,Ben Kao,Tien-Hsuan Wu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为QBR的方法，通过问题库（QB）弥合法学知识与普通用户之间的知识鸿沟，提升法律知识检索的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 普通用户因缺乏专业知识，难以有效检索法律知识，传统检索方法假设用户能提出精确查询，但实际效果不佳。

Method: QBR利用问题库（QB）生成训练样本，优化文档中知识单元的嵌入，实现细粒度知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，QBR比传统方法更准确、高效、可解释，并能提升用户对检索结果的理解。

Conclusion: QBR不仅提升了法律知识检索的效果，还通过案例研究展示了其社会价值，帮助公众解决日常法律问题。

Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem
due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of
fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information
retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and
precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the
wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal
knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which
employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge
gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the
embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective
fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments
various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more
accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension
of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We
also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by
assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.

Abstract: This work presents an open-source unified benchmarking and evaluation
framework for text-to-image generation models, with a particular focus on the
impact of metadata augmented prompts. Leveraging the DeepFashion-MultiModal
dataset, we assess generated outputs through a comprehensive set of
quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP (Contrastive Language
Image Pre-training)-based similarity, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity), FID (Frechet Inception Distance), and retrieval-based measures, as
well as qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate that structured metadata
enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model
robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures. While not a traditional
recommender system, our framework enables task-specific recommendations for
model selection and prompt design based on evaluation metrics.

Result: 展示了工具在生成类别层次、发现错误标签、识别激活通道贡献和定位潜在状态等方面的能力。

Conclusion: ChannelExplorer为分析深度神经网络提供了有效的数据驱动方法，并通过专家评估验证了其价值。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
vision tasks, yet understanding their internal behavior remains challenging,
particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class
separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics
tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing
data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class
separability. ChannelExplorer summarizes activations across layers and
visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to
reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify
activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns.
Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs,
ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of
ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy
in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel
contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion
model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users.

Conclusion: 该技术广泛适用于多目标优化问题，显著减少了手动调整的需求。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous
optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.
Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned
aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance
of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a
time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the
setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically
simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically
used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain
expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability
of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we
present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is
broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,
including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator
receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the
optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters
to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving
comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying
on manually tuned reward functions. Results are best visualized through

Motivation: 旨在通过稀疏曲线抽象3D形状，同时保留几何和视觉特征，并支持用户控制和形状变形。

Method: 分两阶段优化：粗几何捕捉和细粒度特征表示，利用CLIP模型和局部关键点损失进行指导。

Result: 成功应用于复杂形状数据集，支持特征控制和形状变形。

Conclusion: WIR3D为3D形状抽象提供了一种高效且可控的方法。

Abstract: We present WIR3D, a technique for abstracting 3D shapes through a sparse set
of visually meaningful curves in 3D. We optimize the parameters of Bezier
curves such that they faithfully represent both the geometry and salient visual
features (e.g. texture) of the shape from arbitrary viewpoints. We leverage the
intermediate activations of a pre-trained foundation model (CLIP) to guide our
optimization process. We divide our optimization into two phases: one for
capturing the coarse geometry of the shape, and the other for representing
fine-grained features. Our second phase supervision is spatially guided by a
novel localized keypoint loss. This spatial guidance enables user control over
abstracted features. We ensure fidelity to the original surface through a
neural SDF loss, which allows the curves to be used as intuitive deformation
handles. We successfully apply our method for shape abstraction over a broad
dataset of shapes with varying complexity, geometric structure, and texture,
and demonstrate downstream applications for feature control and shape
deformation.

Abstract: Full-body gestures play a pivotal role in natural interactions and are
crucial for achieving effective communication. Nevertheless, most existing
studies primarily focus on the gesture generation of speakers, overlooking the
vital role of listeners in the interaction process and failing to fully explore
the dynamic interaction between them. This paper innovatively proposes an
Inter-Diffusion Generation Model of Speakers and Listeners for Effective
Communication. For the first time, we integrate the full-body gestures of
listeners into the generation framework. By devising a novel inter-diffusion
mechanism, this model can accurately capture the complex interaction patterns
between speakers and listeners during communication. In the model construction
process, based on the advanced diffusion model architecture, we innovatively
introduce interaction conditions and the GAN model to increase the denoising
step size. As a result, when generating gesture sequences, the model can not
only dynamically generate based on the speaker's speech information but also
respond in realtime to the listener's feedback, enabling synergistic
interaction between the two. Abundant experimental results demonstrate that
compared with the current state-of-the-art gesture generation methods, the
model we proposed has achieved remarkable improvements in the naturalness,
coherence, and speech-gesture synchronization of the generated gestures. In the
subjective evaluation experiments, users highly praised the generated
interaction scenarios, believing that they are closer to real life human
communication situations. Objective index evaluations also show that our model
outperforms the baseline methods in multiple key indicators, providing more
powerful support for effective communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速从单一视角实现高保真动态3D重建是计算机视觉中的重大挑战，而C-ToF中的深度信息并非直接测量，增加了优化难度。

Method: 在优化中引入两种启发式方法，改进高斯表示的场景几何精度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在受限C-ToF感知条件下（如快速运动）能生成准确重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景重建中表现出色，解决了C-ToF数据优化的脆弱性问题。

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular
continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that
achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is
100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a
single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF
radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly
measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and
underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based
scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with
multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its
optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to
improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental
results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under
constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging
baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf

Conclusion: 该方法在轮廓矢量化中表现出更高的精度和灵活性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an active contour model for silhouette
vectorization using cubic B\'ezier curves. Among the end points of the B\'ezier
curves, we distinguish between corner and regular points where the orientation
of the tangent vector is prescribed. By minimizing the distance of the B\'ezier
curves to the silhouette boundary, the active contour model optimizes the
location of the B\'ezier curves end points, the orientation of the tangent
vectors in the regular points, and the estimation of the B\'ezier curve
parameters. This active contour model can use the silhouette vectorization
obtained by any method as an initial guess. The proposed method significantly
reduces the average distance between the silhouette boundary and its
vectorization obtained by the world-class graphic software Inkscape, Adobe
Illustrator, and a curvature-based vectorization method, which we introduce for
comparison. Our method also allows us to impose additional regularity on the
B\'ezier curves by reducing their lengths.

### [281] [Generalization Analysis for Contrastive Representation Learning under Non-IID Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04937)
*Nong Minh Hieu,Antoine Ledent*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比表示学习（CRL）在非独立同分布（non-i.i.d.）设置下的泛化行为，填补了理论空白，并推导了样本需求量的对数尺度界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 借鉴U统计量理论，推导了非i.i.d.设置下的泛化界限，并应用于线性映射和神经网络等常见函数类。

Result: 结果表明，每类所需样本量与可学习特征表示类的覆盖数的对数成比例。

Conclusion: 本文为非i.i.d.数据下的CRL提供了理论支持，并验证了其在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in
various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of
the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our
knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the
assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently
and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a
fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle
data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the
tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In
this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under
non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing
inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization
bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as
the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature
representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to
derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and
neural networks.

Motivation: 现有线性系统辨识方法通常假设动态完全线性且依赖单轨迹数据，而实际系统可能非线性，需在特定区域初始化实验。

Conclusion: 数值实验验证了方法有效性，并揭示了单轨迹随机输入在非线性情况下的不足。

Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications
in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for
linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system
trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics
is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a
linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that
there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the
experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data
acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and
provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our
error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and
demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error
due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we
also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a
single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测在交换性数据下具有有限样本覆盖保证，但测试特征中的异常值会破坏交换性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出检测-插补-共形预测框架，先检测异常值再插补，并通过校准集构建交换性特征。开发了PDI-CP和JDI-CP两种算法。

Result: JDI-CP实现了1-2α的有限样本覆盖保证。实验表明算法具有稳健的覆盖性和与基线相当的高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了测试特征异常值问题，为共形预测提供了更可靠的覆盖保证。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for constructing prediction intervals
for black-box models, providing a finite sample coverage guarantee for
exchangeable data. However, this exchangeability is compromised when some
entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise
outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called
detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an
outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation
method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the
uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection
and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing
exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label.
We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a
distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and
imputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\alpha$
coverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and
comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.

Conclusion: 尽管生成模型能生成大量数据，但仅部分数据能有效提升模型性能，框架展示了其潜力，但也揭示了生成模型的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, raises
a key question: how can synthetic data from these models enhance predictive
modeling? While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset
meaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that
generates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific
statistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective
augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive
performance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our
framework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for
data augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic
data, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.

Abstract: The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on
observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test
for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is
whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical
across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text
similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated
using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from
an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated
using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We
showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic
asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting
strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a
unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example
demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type
one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The
proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document
classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is
crucial.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过联合理想分布学习拒绝器的方法，并建立了拒绝与统计散度阈值之间的联系。与边际分布方法相比，联合分布方法使用Bhattacharyya散度，拒绝行为更温和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过边际分布学习拒绝器，但忽略了输入与标签的联合分布。本文旨在探索联合分布对拒绝行为的影响。

Method: 提出学习联合理想分布，并通过统计散度阈值（如Bhattacharyya散度）实现拒绝。

Result: 发现联合分布方法使用Bhattacharyya散度时，拒绝行为比边际分布方法（Chow规则）更温和。

Conclusion: 联合分布方法为拒绝学习提供了新视角，Bhattacharyya散度是一种更温和的拒绝策略。

Abstract: Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to
abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an
ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a
hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal
distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint
ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between
rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find
that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by
considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the
skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in
contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical
characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a
thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that
rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何神经网络和矩阵李群的性质，实现了全局最优权重搜索和鲁棒跟踪控制。

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems
evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and
bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of
matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space
$\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights
that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not
require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie
groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a
global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error
signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free
configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established
using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation
control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system
operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions.
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex
dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks
systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper
proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations
(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,
LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between
temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,
while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations
at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated
algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and
objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of
different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python
package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system
optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available
at https://github.com/xuwkk/lapso_exp.

Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant
framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the
macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant
models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations
in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by
combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors.
The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding
and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained
architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training
process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning
problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar
function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the
appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions
that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to
implement, and accurate in practical settings.

Result: 模式过滤有效优化了Text2Cypher任务，尤其对小模型效果显著；大模型因上下文能力较强受益较少，但仍能降低成本。

Conclusion: 模式过滤在Text2Cypher任务中具有实用价值，尤其适合成本敏感场景。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and
properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables
efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models
allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries -
Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts.
However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and
raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by
including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while
reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for
Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and
cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher,
especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that
larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context
capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and
smaller models in cost reduction.

Abstract: Database query languages such as SQL for relational databases and Cypher for
graph databases have been widely adopted. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through
models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically
requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as
dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller,
high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better
performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques
for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance
while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example
selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on
performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a
cost-effective solution.

Abstract: Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time
correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al.
2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem
of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic
and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an
orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure
the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via
exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted
in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is
also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and
intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve
predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample
size properties are also tested in a real-data application via
cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector
field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite
NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.
