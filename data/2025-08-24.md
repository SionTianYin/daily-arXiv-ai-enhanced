### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过统一的共同训练框架，在单个SFT阶段集成多种安全行为，通过系统指令动态切换行为模式，实现高效、精细的内容安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）需要多阶段训练，缺乏部署后的细粒度控制能力，训练复杂度和部署成本高。

Method: 提出统一共同训练框架，在单个SFT阶段集成三种安全行为：积极行为（合法/利他）、消极行为（无过滤/风险倾向）和拒绝行为（拒绝导向/保守），通过系统指令或魔法token动态激活。

Result: 训练的8B模型在安全性能上超越DeepSeek-R1（671B），达到SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，显著降低了训练复杂度和部署成本，并在输出空间形成了明确的安全对齐边界。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且具有高度可控性的LLM内容安全解决方案，实现了前所未有的细粒度控制能力。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译共享任务的初步自动评估排名报告，提醒参与者注意自动评估可能存在的偏差，最终排名将以人工评估为准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向任务参与者分享初步结果，帮助他们在准备系统提交论文时参考，同时说明自动评估的局限性

Method: 使用自动指标对机器翻译系统进行评估和排名

Result: 生成了基于自动指标的初步排名，但指出该排名可能偏向使用重排序技术的系统

Conclusion: 自动排名仅供参考，最终官方排名将基于更可靠的人工评估，人工评估结果将取代自动排名

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，用于自动生成包含本土化实体（人名、组织、货币）的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决现有翻译数据集的英语中心偏向问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言和文化基础的数学推理在低资源语言中较英语偏微，主要因为缺乏反映本土化实体的社会文化任务数据集，而现有翻译数据集通常保留英语中心实体。

Method: 提出一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够自动从现有数据源构建包含本土化名称、组织和货币的数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，翻译的基准测试集可能隐藏了真实的多语言数学能力，而本文框架能够减少英语中心实体偏向，提高各种语言中本土化实体的稳健性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多语言数学推理中的文化本土化问题，为构建真正本土化的多语言数据集提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，使用程序化筛选的语料对公开模型GaMS-9B-Instruct进行细调，在斯洛文文档翻译中获得了更好的翻译质量和更少语言格式错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型已成为有效的机器翻译系统，但需要探索如何使用较少的易于生产的数据资源来改进通用指令调整模型的翻译性能。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，通过程序化筛选和增强公开数据集的子集来训练模型。使用两个LLM(GaMS-9B-Instruct和EuroLLM-9B-Instruct)翻译英语维基百科文章，然后基于合成自动评估指标(COMET)的算法对翻译进行质量排名，生成质量排名的语料对。

Result: 细调后的模型在翻译维基百科文档时，COMET得分比基准模型分别提高了0.04和0.02，表现超过了参与数据集生成的两个模型。模型还更一致地避免了语言和格式错误。

Conclusion: 通过直接偏好优化技术和程序化筛选的质量排名语料，可以使用较少的数据资源有效地改进通用指令调整大语言模型的翻译性能，特别是在小语种(如斯洛文)翻译任务中。

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass自定义输入数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统在英语方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的问题。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL覆盖5种语言，提出新的解析方法，并创建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取，使用多种LLM进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的解析性能，在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估，比较了不同规模的LLM和BERT类模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有助于提升多语言ConvXAI系统的意图识别能力，特别是在低资源语言和自定义输入场景下的表现。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样算法(SSS)，通过在推理时使用对齐的小型草稿模型来高效实现测试时对齐，显著降低推理成本的同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但往往带来巨大的推理成本，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: SSS算法：让小型草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而目标模型保持不变。通过修改接受标准和奖励token分布，利用对齐草稿模型和未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移来恢复RLHF最优解

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，该算法以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的黄金奖励分数

Conclusion: SSS算法验证了在保持有效性的同时显著提高测试时对齐效率的可行性，为解决LLM对齐的推理成本问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过将答案分解为自包含事实、进行词汇和语义过滤、结构化蕴含检查来准确评估机器生成文本的完整性，在长格式QA基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，而LLM评判方法存在错位和幻觉问题，需要结构化验证。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实；2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配范围；3)通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐性。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的长格式QA基准测试中，使用人工标注和LLM评判，LongRecall在召回准确率上相比强大的词汇和LLM评判基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: LongRecall通过结构化分解和验证减少了假阳性和假阴性，适应了不同的表达方式和上下文变化，为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建模块。

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将大型语言模型与组合推理相结合的方法，通过符号推理增强LLMs的结构一致性和预测准确性，在结构化预测任务中取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然在各种语言任务中表现出色，但由于其自回归特性，容易产生幻觉和复杂推理问题。特别是在结构化预测任务中，需要保持结构一致性。

Method: 结合LLMs与组合推理方法，研究不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度值，使用符号推理增强预测的结构一致性，并通过结构化预测目标进行校准和微调。

Result: 实验表明，无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上添加符号推理都能产生更一致和准确的预测。使用结构化学习目标进行校准和微调可显著提升在挑战性任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 在LLM时代，结构化学习仍然具有重要价值，将符号推理与LLMs相结合可以弥补LLMs在结构一致性方面的不足，提高预测质量。

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

### [9] [Nemotron-CC-Math: A 133 Billion-Token-Scale High Quality Math Pretraining Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15096)
*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nemotron-CC-Math，一个从Common Crawl构建的大规模高质量数学语料库，使用新颖的领域无关管道进行科学文本提取，显著提升了LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集质量较差，存在提取启发式方法脆弱、HTML到文本转换有损、无法可靠保存数学结构等问题，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据。

Method: 开发了新颖的领域无关管道，通过布局感知渲染（lynx）和基于LLM的针对性清理阶段，恢复多种格式的数学内容（MathJax、KaTeX、MathML），保持方程和代码块的结构完整性。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+（133B tokens）和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+（52B tokens）语料库，后者超越所有现有开放数学数据集。预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上提升+4.8到+12.6，在MBPP+上提升+4.6到+14.3，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能。

Conclusion: 提出了首个可靠从噪声网络数据中提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和通用推理方面取得可衡量的提升，为开源社区发布了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

### [10] [Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139)
*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，通过外部证据检索和原子假设验证来减少LLM的幻觉现象，实验证明该方法能提高回答准确性并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理包含错误假设的问题时容易产生幻觉，生成误导性答案，需要开发方法来识别这些错误假设并提供准确回答。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证任务，利用外部证据检索来缓解幻觉，通过生成和验证原子假设来提供可解释的答案。

Result: 在五个大型语言模型上的实验表明：(1) 整合检索到的证据是有益的；(2) 生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 通过外部证据检索和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉现象，提高回答的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

### [11] [ContextualLVLM-Agent: A Holistic Framework for Multi-Turn Visually-Grounded Dialogue and Complex Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15164)
*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准数据集和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环提升多模态模型的复杂推理能力，在多项指标上超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和多模态模型在处理复杂多轮视觉对话任务时存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，需要更全面的基准测试和改进框架。

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环，无需重新训练底层模型。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在人类评估中获得4.03分，超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计和迭代方法有效提升了多模态模型在复杂对话任务中的性能，验证了其在扩展对话轮次中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少冗余分词，在长文本建模中实现2.4倍分词减少和1.9倍加速，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余区域过度分词和上下文连贯性利用不足，特别是在长上下文场景中。

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等价的分词；然后基于语义密度分配异质分词粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩。

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长文本建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的分词减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向，SemToken框架可以无缝集成到现代语言模型和注意力加速方法中。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更具结构性、符号化且对事实和监管准确性敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM，一个领域专业化的轨迹感知PRM，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于基线模型，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过在通道级别对KV缓存进行剪枝来减少长上下文推理中的内存和计算开销，同时保持模型精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，导致效率和模型准确性平衡能力有限

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV缓存应用非结构化稀疏性（剪枝），并在注意力分数计算期间动态恢复被剪枝的条目，该方法与现有KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，对等长序列可减少30%以上KV缓存存储，即使在80%的激进剪枝比例下，性能下降也小于5%

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级剪枝有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了长序列处理效率，且与现有技术兼容

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA中表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨领域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know (S2K)框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，且以显著更低的成本达到领域预训练LLM的性能水平。

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识获取策略有效解决了领域特定QA中的挑战，实现了成本效益和性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

TL;DR: SEER是一种自引导方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，解决LLM在多步工具调用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题，无需手动设计演示或检索静态库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: 提出Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式扩充经验池，包含过去成功的执行轨迹。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单和困难问题上分别平均提升6.1%和4.7%。在τ-bench真实世界领域测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER通过自引导的经验检索方法有效解决了LLM在多步工具调用中的挑战，实现了持续性能改进，无需依赖静态或手动策划的库。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中如何有效使用检查清单，发现选择性使用检查清单在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动生成检查清单是一种有前景但研究不足的方法。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查清单，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查清单的有效性，并分析检查清单项目与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查清单在成对比较设置中能改善评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不稳定。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查清单项目也反映了人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准来指导人工和自动评估，以减少评估中的不一致性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少SLM词汇相关组件内存使用达99%，且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在边缘设备部署时面临内存瓶颈，主要来自词汇相关组件（嵌入和LM头）的大词汇量。现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和组件计算特性不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：卸载嵌入组件，为LM头设计混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，实现按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能仅有最小或没有下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了SLM内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型在说英语时表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现未知。存在的测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和专业领域的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员多阶段质量控制过程制作。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的表现差距；(2)指令微调研究与消融实验，分离原生监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型在领域内外测试中都超过使用翻译数据的模型。识别出了文化和专业特定任务上的性能差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业知识的原生指令数据，以提高大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换语音技术因缺乏合适数据集而发展受限的问题

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（基于词性替换同义词）生成不改变语义的代码切换语音样本

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集相当

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动代码切换语音技术发展，实现更具包容性的多语言系统

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的人格特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化且极化，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型模拟专业角色（如教师）时缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，需要建立专门的评估框架来确保教育AI的伦理和心理对齐。

Method: 提出EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击，模型温度等超参数对风险行为影响有限。

Conclusion: 本文建立了首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在处理检索到的外部知识与LLM内部参数知识冲突时存在困难，无法有效解决上下文-记忆冲突问题

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware RAG (CARE)框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆token嵌入和基于grounded/adversarial的软提示训练，来识别不可靠上下文并引导推理

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中，CARE平均获得5.0%的性能提升，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了一个有前景的方向，能够更好地处理外部知识与内部知识的冲突

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件需要掌握其时间上下文，但时间常识在自然语言中往往不明确表述。即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此自动挖掘时间常识对于构建鲁棒的语言模型至关重要。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到超过80%的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量数据集，并提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能，为构建更鲁棒的语言模型提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表示，但传统方法需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式

Method: 使用短固定宽度窗口独立处理，学习所有语言共有的基础声学模式，参数量少于当前方法

Result: 在多种语言上通过监督和自监督训练进行广泛评估，包括UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过在音素长度窗口内建模基础声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全模型评估存在挑战，不同数据集和指标（如MRR、Hit@k）的评估结果往往不一致，难以进行整体性能比较和模型选择

Method: 基于距离平均解的评估方法（EDAS），通过数学方法将多数据集、多指标的性能数据整合为0-1范围内的统一评分

Conclusion: EDAS提供了一个统一的元度量标准，支持更明智的模型选择，促进跨数据集评估的公平性，为知识图谱补全模型的综合评估提供了可靠框架

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

### [27] [Unveiling Trust in Multimodal Large Language Models: Evaluation, Analysis, and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15370)
*Yichi Zhang,Yao Huang,Yifan Wang,Yitong Sun,Chang Liu,Zhe Zhao,Zhengwei Fang,Huanran Chen,Xiao Yang,Xingxing Wei,Hang Su,Yinpeng Dong,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X是一个全面的多模态大语言模型可信度评估基准，包含5个可信度维度、2种新型风险类型和多种缓解策略，通过32个任务和28个数据集对30多个模型进行评估，揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞和缓解策略的局限性，并提出了推理增强的安全对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的可信度存在严重问题，现有评估方法过于片面且忽视了多模态带来的风险，需要建立一个全面的评估基准来系统性地分析和缓解这些可信度问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维度框架：5个可信度方面(真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私性)、2种新型风险类型(多模态风险和跨模态影响)、多种缓解策略(数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法)。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有MLLM，并分析了8种代表性缓解方法。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略虽然在某些方面有改进，但很少有方法能有效解决整体可信度问题，且许多方法会带来意外的权衡而损害模型效用。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐(RESA)方法，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果。研究结果为未来改进提供了实用见解，特别是推理在平衡安全性和性能方面的益处。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的自适应推测解码框架，通过置信度调节动态调整推测生成长度和验证标准，提高解码效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了性能

Method: 利用熵和边界不确定性度量来动态调节每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调节验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码显著加速，同时保持或改善BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型在不同不确定性条件下提供了高效、鲁棒的即插即用解码方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验证明了语言模型中词汇表规模扩大的真正效果，发现更大词汇表通过降低标记化文本的复杂性来改善模型性能，而非缓解词频不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别语言模型训练中词汇表规模不断扩大的趋势，但其真正改善源泄不清，需要控制性实验来探究词汇表规模扩大的实质效果和机制

Method: 在保持数据、计算资源和优化固定的条件下，将语言模型的词汇表从24K扩展到196K，采用Kolmogorov复杂性来形式化标记化文本的复杂性，并通过词级损失分解分析不同词汇规模下的性能差异

Result: 词汇表规模扩大主要通过降低标记化文本的复杂性来改善模型性能，这种改善平积在下游测试中保持不变，模型实际上利用而非受到词频不平衡的负面影响

Conclusion: 词汇表扩大的核心效益在于降低标记化文本的复杂性，这为标记化器与模型的协同设计提供了简单而有理论基础的控制手段，同时也清楚地解释了预训练中语言模型扩展的损失动态机制

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MCR-BENCH基准，发现大型音频-语言模型在处理音频-文本冲突信息时存在显著的文本偏向，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在处理多模态输入时，对音频和文本信息冲突情况下的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要评估模型如何优先处理不一致的信息。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过不一致的音频-文本对评估模型表现，分析影响因素，并通过监督微调探索缓解策略，分析模型置信度模式。

Result: 发现LALMs存在显著的文本偏向，经常忽略音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能大幅下降，即使在矛盾输入情况下也表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 需要在训练过程中改进模态平衡，开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Method: 开发了LLaSO框架，包含三个核心资源：1200万实例的语音文本对齐语料库、1350万实例的多任务指令调优数据集，以及可复现的标准化评估基准。基于这些资源训练了38亿参数的参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型取得了0.72的标准化分数，建立了强大的可复现基线，超越了同类可比模型。分析发现更广泛的训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著泛化差距，特别是在纯音频场景中。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准和模型堆栈，LLaSO建立了基础性的开放标准，旨在统一研究努力并加速社区驱动的大型语音语言模型发展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Conclusion: 虽然部分非对等词已经有专业转换方法，但仍有许多词汇需要进一步处理。本研究为语言学家和翻译人员提供了有效的非对等词处理方法和实践案例。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的状态跟踪，需要一种更有效的方法来改进对话状态跟踪性能。

Method: PyTOD采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD展示了通过代码生成和反馈机制实现高效对话状态跟踪的可行性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization构建，包含两个关键创新：1) 基于实时F1统计动态调整临床挑战性错误类型权重的子分数动态加权；2) 基于子分数一致性推导提示难度来调整策略梯度更新的多数引导优势缩放。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有先前的离线指标，达到了与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床基础、可解释且细粒度的放射学报告评估框架，通过创新的动态加权和优势缩放技术实现了更稳定的优化和更好的专家临床判断对齐，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销对提升客户参与度和业务增长至关重要，现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，而个性化优惠生成具有显著提升转化率和客户满意度的潜力

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调Google的T5-Small模型，采用InfoNCE损失在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关优惠，通过自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间

Result: 在模拟客户行为和优惠接受模式的合成数据集上，相比监督微调基线模型，优惠接受率提升了17%

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型展示了对比学习方法在个性化优惠生成任务中的有效性

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Conclusion: 对于主观性行为的模拟，聚类特徚的小型模型比单一的大型模型更有效，能够更好地平滑地满足不同用户群体的异质性需求。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLM-Bench是首个专门评估小型语言模型(SLMs)的基准测试，从准确性、计算效率和可持续性三个维度对15个SLM在9个NLP任务上进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对小型语言模型性能和环境影响系统性评估的基准测试，需要建立全面的评估标准来填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了SLM-Bench基准测试，在4种硬件配置下评估15个SLM模型，使用23个数据集覆盖14个领域，量化11个指标包括正确性、计算和能耗指标。

Result: 研究发现不同SLM模型在准确性和能效方面存在显著权衡，有些模型准确性突出，有些能效更优。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，弥合了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距，提供了开源基准测试管道促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子的句子，标注了12种细粒度社会身份，使用希伯来语调优的大语言模型取得了最佳效果（macro-F1=0.74）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会身份检测数据集主要是英语中心、单标签且关注粗粒度身份类别，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中细粒度社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建包含5536个句子的希伯来语多标签语料库，手动标注12种基于调查数据的细粒度社会身份，对比多标签/单标签编码器和2B-9B参数生成式LLM的性能。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（macro-F1=0.74），应用分类器分析政客Facebook帖子和议会演讲，发现身份表达的流行度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Conclusion: Dream 7B通过简单有效的训练技术实现了扩散语言建模的重大进展，发布的Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct模型将促进该领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政治人物使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)的自动分析可行性，通过大规模计算研究理解民主话语中的规范性攻击现象。

Method: 构建包含10,410个句子的希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM；使用DictaLM 2.0模型进行二元PDD检测和多特征分类。

Result: 最佳模型在二元PDD检测上F1得分0.74，多特征分类macro-F1得分0.67；分析显示PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍(17.4%)，男性政治家使用多于女性，右翼行为者倾向更强，选举期间和重大政治事件中出现峰值。

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，研究为政治话语分析提供了新的计算方法和实证发现。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号来提升生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力远强于作为生成器防御攻击的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究者探索对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO框架，通过强化学习利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: 实验表明SDGO显著提升模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 通过对齐判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本就能进一步提升生成能力，为LLM安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Method: 构建SurGE基准，包括主题描述、专家撰写综述和引用文献的测试实例集合，以及百万篇论文的学术语料库；提出自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖度、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度进行评估。

Result: 对多种基于LLM的方法评估表明，即使使用先进的自反思框架，综述生成仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该任务复杂度高，需要持续研究，所有代码、数据和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）在不同上下文位置表现出不均匀的敏感性，严重损害长上下文理解和处理能力。现有方法通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的位置偏差仍然存在。

Method: 提出Pos2Distill知识蒸馏框架，利用位置诱导的差异来抵消位置偏差本身。针对检索和推理两种范式设计了专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升，所有上下文位置都获得改善。

Conclusion: 两个专门化系统在各自任务上表现出优异的性能，同时展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，相互之间也能很好地进行知识迁移。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 孜加拉语作为世界第七大语言，因资源和标注数据集缺乏而数字化表现不足。词干提取对于这种趋势性强的低资源语言至关重要，可以降低算法复杂度。

Method: 进行了孜加拉语词干提取方法的综述性调查和分析，重点关注形态变体处理的效果。

Result: 发现现有研究存在显著空白，早期研究中断且可复现实现缺乏，评估方法不适用，应该采用更相关的指标。

Conclusion: 建议发展健壮的孜加拉语词干提取器，持续研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台包含丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正提升产品理解效果，以及图像是否可能带来冗余或性能下降

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（406,190样本，8,989,510图像），包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用值来策略性利用多图像信息

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低效果；SUMEI方法在综合实验中表现出有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在电商任务中难以有效利用丰富的视觉内容，需要开发像SUMEI这样的数据驱动方法来策略性选择和使用图像信息

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过强化学习训练的智能RAG框架有效提升了医疗诊断的准确性和可解释性，为临床医生提供更可靠的初步诊断支持

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

TL;DR: ReasonZoo基准测试显示，工具集成推理(TIR)能显著提升大语言模型在数学和非数学推理任务中的表现，并通过新指标PAC和AUC-PCC证明TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍有不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其对LLM推理能力的泛化效果和改进机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同的推理类别，用于评估TIR在各个领域的有效性。同时提出了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估表明，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中始终优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理过程。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在推进LLM复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力，证明TIR不仅能提升性能，还能优化推理行为模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: LiveMCP-101为评估真实世界代理能力设定了严格标准，指出了推进当前模型的具体方向，推动通过工具使用可靠执行复杂任务的自主AI系统发展。

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [55] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这种长期选择，探索是否存在更好的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，实现了端到端的可微分训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点检测基准上达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好/有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非面部关键点检测的唯一选择，基于结构化预测的替代方法能够实现更快的训练收敛和竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种将图卷积网络(GCN)与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，需要一种能够更好建模关系数据的方法来提升图像分类性能，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别时。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分对图进行优化，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类精度改进，超越了最先进的方法，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新的视角，拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [57] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，无需额外数据即可实现高性能的物体检测和姿态估计统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案大多依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联方法，需要更简单的仅RGB替代方案，直接在类别级别学习，统一物体检测和9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越先前仅RGB方法，大幅缩小与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了无需额外数据即可实现高性能的物体检测和9自由度姿态估计统一，在三个基准测试中创造了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的训练框架Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework，能够同时检测物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，在Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge基准测试中达到2.10%的平均分类错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统使用分离的模型处理物理攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统复杂性、推理延迟，并且容易受到组合攻击向量的威胁。

Method: 使用配对采样对比学习框架，通过自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对来学习模态无关的活体检测特征。

Result: 在第六届Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上达到2.10%的平均分类错误率(ACER)，计算量轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间不到一小时。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个实用且高效的统一解决方案，能够同时处理物理和数字攻击，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过仅需3-20个采样步骤从无条件扩散模型中高效生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算速度快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型对抗攻击方法往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但通常需要数百个采样步骤，因此需要开发更高效的对抗生成方法。

Method: 提出TAIGen方法：1）在混合步长区间注入扰动，无需处理所有时间步；2）采用选择性RGB通道策略，对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动；3）保持图像结构的同时最大化目标模型的误分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，以VGGNet为源模型，对ResNet攻击成功率达70.6%，对MNASNet达80.8%，对ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB，视觉质量高；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍；达到最低的鲁棒准确率。

Conclusion: TAIGen是一种高效且有效的对抗图像生成方法，能够在保持高质量的同时实现高攻击成功率，计算效率显著优于现有方法，是防御机制最难净化的最具影响力的攻击方法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式精炼解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并利用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且存在不确定性处理不足的问题。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络。包含三个模块：CORE（掩码域可逆建模）、CARE（RGB域可逆建模）、FINE（基于伯努利扩散模型的精炼）。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算效率高。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络和生成式精炼的协同作用，为隐蔽视觉感知提供了新的解决方案，建立了更鲁棒的CVP系统框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow是一个新颖的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成中的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能导致图像生成过程经过数据流形的低概率区域。需要探索轨迹曲率与生成图像语义对齐之间的关系。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，直接在流路径中融入曲率指导，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术来惩罚轨迹内在动态的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成任务中达到了最先进的性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线方法，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和质量对齐方法，仅使用输入图像就能预测质量分数，无需参考图像或主观标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的通用解决方案。

Method: 提出分层排序和质量对齐框架，结合排序学习和对比学习。使用高阶排序损失监督质量预测，嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致，并通过结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: HiRQA在合成和真实失真基准测试中表现出最先进的性能，具有很强的泛化能力，能够有效处理镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊和低光条件等各种失真。轻量级版本HiRQA-S每张图像推理时间仅3.5ms。

Conclusion: HiRQA框架通过自监督学习方法成功解决了无参考图像质量评估的泛化问题，在仅使用合成失真训练的情况下能够有效泛化到真实失真，为实时部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Conclusion: 提出的投资组合理论方法能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保多视角3D重建的质量和可靠性

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理生成的挑战，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景合成解决方案，具有重要的应用价值

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Conclusion: STAGNet模型为基于单一视频输入的事故预测提供了更有效的解决方案，具有更好的泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

*Ziang Cao,Zhaoxi Chen,Liang Pan,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过多模态协作编码整合RGB、RGBD和点云数据，利用triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产，在少量训练数据下实现与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成架构大多局限于单模态或纯3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的规模和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 使用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在少量训练数据下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了扩展多模态数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM成功证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的价值，为利用多样化3D数据源提供了有效框架，显著提升了纹理和几何细节的质量。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差

Method: 包含软原型对比模块（使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型）和双重一致性学习模块（对齐相同样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域）

Result: 在五个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法有效

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效避免类间冲突、减少原型漂移，并提供可靠的原型计算保证

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Motivation: 传统无人机视觉语言导航存在轨迹过长、机动复杂的问题，需要人类干预或过于详细的指令。利用无人机高机动性提供多粒度视角的同时，需要保持可管理的运动空间。

Method: 提出双无人机协作框架AeroDuo：高空无人机使用多模态大语言模型进行环境推理，低空无人机使用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位，仅交换最小坐标信息确保效率。

Result: 构建了HaL-13k数据集，包含13,838条协作轨迹和面向目标的语言指令，包含未见地图和未见对象验证集来评估泛化能力。

Conclusion: 双高度无人机协作方法能够有效利用各自优势，高空负责环境推理，低空负责精确导航，通过最小信息交换实现高效协作，解决了传统无人机VLN的挑战。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，可以直接绕过多个中间去噪步骤，实现扩散模型的高效采样，而无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中表现优异，但其顺序生成过程需要多步采样，效率较低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程是否也能实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出了跳过步采样机制，直接从训练目标推导出马尔可夫方式的加速采样方法，并与DDIM结合形成增强生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能以显著减少的采样步骤实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性，通过马尔可夫方式实现加速采样，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Conclusion: 为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的研究方向，推动了图像编码范式的演进。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented
Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is
built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two
lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the
state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配结果进行监督，导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能不佳。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器结构，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，提升了车道拓扑推理的整体性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频中的先天性心脏病检测面临图像噪声和探头位置变异性的挑战，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时序信息、仅限于二分类且缺乏预测校准。

Method: TPA方法利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取视频子剪辑的帧特征，使用可训练时序提取器聚合特征以捕捉心脏运动，并通过边缘铰链对比损失将视频表示与类别特定文本提示对齐。还引入了条件变分自编码器风格调制模块来学习潜在风格向量以调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Conclusion: TPA是一个有效的胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类框架，成功整合了时序建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，在准确性和临床可靠性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的广泛实验表明，RAG-SEG的性能达到或超越了最先进方法，且所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算效率和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需传统训练的高效伪装目标检测范式，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算资源需求，具有很好的实用性。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整和抗干扰噪声引导，有效防止文本到视频扩散模型生成不良内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，这些模型通常使用未经授权的个人身份、艺术创作和有害材料进行训练，导致不良内容的无控制生产和传播。

Method: VideoEraser采用两阶段过程：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块与主流文本到视频扩散模型集成。

Result: 在四个任务（物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除）上，VideoEraser在效能、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制文本到视频生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决隐私、版权和安全问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本文通过注意力敲除技术系统分析Video-LLMs内部机制，发现视频信息处理主要在早期层完成，中间层是关键节点，且时空建模更依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体：视频时序敲除、视频空间敲除和语言到视频敲除，并在不同层数窗口上应用，设置全局和细粒度两种分析设置。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，形成两阶段处理过程；某些中间层对视频问答有超大影响；时空建模更依赖语言引导检索。这些见解可用于减少注意力计算。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供了可解释性和效率提升的视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

TL;DR: BioTune是一种进化自适应微调技术，通过进化算法选择性地微调特定层来提升迁移学习效率，在多个图像分类数据集上实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和计算成本高。需要一种更高效的迁移学习方法来减少可训练参数数量并降低计算成本。

Method: 使用进化算法识别出需要微调的聚焦层集合，选择性地只对这些相关层进行微调，而不是更新所有模型参数。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等现有微调方法，实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过将微调过程集中在相关层子集上，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 使用图像条件化的高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，采用跨训练场景共享的固定码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于解码时图像的场景重建

Result: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景更新适应性方面均优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降至千字节级别同时保持视觉保真度

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D高斯溅射的压缩效率，解决了长期归档的存储限制问题，并提供了归档后场景变化的适应能力

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，针对驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的新视角合成性能。


<details>

Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态和静态组件时忽视了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远区域以增强近距离细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯建模非刚性动态对象，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验监督整个框架，提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的严格评估表明，该方法在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的运动模糊和几何表示不准确问题，为驾驶场景的高质量重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性瓶颈，Raven渐进矩阵问题被用作评估抽象推理能力的权威基准。本文旨在通过因果链建模方法提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计基线模型DIO架构。针对互信息优化目标的局限性，逐步提出三种改进方法。

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的互信息最大化优化目标无法让模型真正获得预设的人类推理逻辑，主要原因是下界紧致性影响和互信息无法捕捉因果关系。

Conclusion: 需要克服互信息优化的局限性，通过渐进改进方法来更好地建模RPM任务中的因果关系和抽象推理逻辑。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖和保持语义连贯性，且在多通道特征融合时易受噪声影响，需要更高效的信息密度和更低计算复杂度的解决方案。

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合SNN、图推理和变分推理，有效解决了视频摘要中的关键挑战，提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Motivation: 尽管MAE在视觉基础模型预训练中表现出色，但在新数据集上应用时需要大量超参数调优。现有理论研究主要关注注意力模式和分层潜变量模型，而MAE超参数与下游任务性能之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，研究掩码比例和补丁大小对空间相关性选择的影响，并将分析扩展到非线性MAE，证明MAE表示能适应数据集的空间相关性。

Result: 研究发现MAE超参数（掩码比例和补丁大小）可以控制学习特征的空间范围，短程和长程空间相关性都能被有效捕获，且MAE表示能超越二阶统计量适应数据集的空间结构。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了MAE超参数选择的实践指导，揭示了MAE如何通过空间相关性学习实现有效表示，为在实际应用中优化MAE性能提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 提出的双向时间信息传播方法有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，实现了红外小目标检测的全局优化和高效性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

TL;DR: MATR是基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务面临语义帧级对齐和复杂依赖关系建模的挑战，需要开发能够精确捕捉语义上下文和时间细节的模型。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用基于Transformer的双阶段序列对齐机制，将目标视频表征基于查询视频特征进行条件化，并采用自监督预训练技术进行任务特定初始化。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上相对现有方法提升13.1%的R@1和8.1%的mIoU；在新提出的SportsMoments数据集上提升14.7%的R@1和14.4%的mIoU。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，证明了其在复杂视频语义匹配任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯泼溅方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS方法严重依赖密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，在极稀疏视角下SfM初始化失败导致渲染质量下降

Method: 提出稠密立体模块逐步估计相机位姿并重建全局稠密点云；设计一致性视角插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅2个训练视角）PSNR提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了极稀疏视角下的3D重建问题，无需SfM初始化，在渲染质量和几何结构重建方面均取得显著提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上保持优异的零样本泛化性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视角3D人体重建方法（如ECON）在几何细节和身体姿态估计方面存在局限，需要利用多视角信息来提升重建质量和一致性

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化（JMBO）算法，在所有输入视角上联合拟合SMPL-X身体模型，确保多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节；整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等细节

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线方法 consistently 提升重建保真度，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力，且无需重新训练网络

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，通过多视角联合优化和法线图整合有效提升了3D着装人体重建的质量和细节表现

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效多模态融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过自适应频率分离和跨域融合，在多模态图像融合任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为通用融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的完整框架，结合了几何和生成先验，通过创新的Road Surface Gaussian表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志合成外推视图对于自动驾驶车辆的场景模拟至关重要，但现有方法使用生成先验作为伪地面实况时，往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: 提出了ExtraGS框架，包含：1）基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示；2）使用可学习缩放因子处理远处物体的Far Field Gaussians；3）基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架，选择性地在出现外推伪影的地方集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持了高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，以及创新的表示方法和不确定性估计框架，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶模拟提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种能够有效处理这些复杂场景的新方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，利用文本到视频模型的先验，并包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法成功解决了复杂多对象草图动画的挑战，通过创新的两阶段架构和专门设计的网络模块，实现了高质量且时间一致的动画生成，为草图动画的实际应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度窄路分割的网络，通过差分注意力膨胀提取、双流解码融合和多尺度膨胀策略，有效解决了窄路宽度有限、拓扑破碎和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中的窄路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑破碎和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过拟合到一般道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力膨胀提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度膨胀策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet是复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件似然，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，导致决策边界不可靠和预测校准不足。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来校正可能的似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过邻居感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，引导INR模型早期关注高频细节，有效缓解频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏差问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理。现有方法主要通过架构修改或特殊激活函数解决，本文探索通过直接指导训练过程的新方向。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1)使用邻居感知软掩码自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；2)过渡到全图像训练。这是一种频率感知的像素重要性分配方法。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法持续改善重建质量，并能与现有INR方法互补。

Conclusion: 作为在图像INR中分配频率感知像素重要性的开创性尝试，本文为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在旋转轴已知的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，显著提升了视频时间感知和实体交互的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知上表现粗糙，时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移，需要更精确的时间定位和实体交互理解能力。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）扩散时间潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性；2）对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3）混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过创新的时间编码和实体接地机制，成功解决了视频理解中的时间感知粗糙问题，为精细时间推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法用于机载激光扫描数据的树木实例分割，通过人工质量评估标签训练评分模型，再用于改进分割模型，在正确识别树木实例方面提升34%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据的树木分割面临数据变异性和标注成本高的挑战，需要开发弱监督方法来减少对精确标注数据的依赖

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，人工进行质量评级，训练评分模型对分割输出分类，然后用评分模型的反馈微调分割模型

Result: 原始分割模型在正确识别树木实例方面提升34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了树木分割性能，但在稀疏林区的小树（低于2米）和复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中仍存在挑战，性能有所下降

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下无需目标模型信息即可生成有效对抗样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以保证不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移攻击能力，在黑盒场景下实现了优异的攻击效果

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 现有在线高精地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致推理时计算开销大且受限于过时地图信息，需要开发更高效、低成本的视觉中心解决方案

Method: 提出多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架MapKD，采用教师-教练-学生范式：1）多模态教师模型；2）视觉中心教练模型；3）轻量级学生模型。引入TGPD和MSRD两种蒸馏策略进行特征对齐和语义学习

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型性能提升+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时显著加速推理速度

Conclusion: MapKD框架成功实现了从多模态模型到轻量级视觉模型的有效知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效、低成本的在线地图构建解决方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

TL;DR: 提出CM2LoD3方法，通过冲突图和纹理分割融合来自动重建LoD3级别的建筑模型，解决了传统手动建模的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素，而LoD3模型需要手动建模，难以大规模应用，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 利用射线到模型先验分析获得冲突图(CMs)，开发语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)进行语义分割，并将纹理模型分割结果与冲突图通过置信度融合

Result: 实验显示该方法能有效分割和重建建筑开口，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合达到61%的性能

Conclusion: 该方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了MDPR框架，通过多维度动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，通过动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要提前编码整个视觉上下文或预先知道问题，不适用于长视频理解和多轮对话场景。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，同时维持固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，与查询感知压缩方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话提供了一种高效的内存管理解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，在长序列中会导致对象结构和运动误差累积，缺乏结构性和时间一致性。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长时程建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的结构漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割（如特定核亚型识别）方面存在挑战，需要减少标注工作量并提高在资源有限环境下的可访问性。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能学习减少像素级标注需求；2）SAM适配器增强语义特异性；3）分子导向校正学习（MOCL）提高分割精度。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验表明，All-in-SAM模型显著提高了细胞分类性能，即使面对不同质量的标注。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减少了标注工作量，还将精确生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限环境，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and

Conclusion: ATLAS通过解耦形状和骨骼基实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度的身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，为高保真人体建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Conclusion: VAREdit通过自回归范式和多尺度特征预测，在编辑遵循度和效率方面都取得了显著进步，为指令引导图像编辑提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在保证样本质量的同时最大化组多样性，显著改善了生成模型输出集的多样性和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。实际应用中用户通常需要一组多样化且高质量的样本

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架适用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务

Conclusion: 该方法使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更丰富的输出选择

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale是一种无需微调的推理范式，能够实现8K图像生成和4K视频生成，解决了现有方法在高分辨率生成时出现的重复模式问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉扩散模型由于缺乏高分辨率数据和计算资源限制，通常只能在有限分辨率下训练，限制了其生成高保真高分辨率图像和视频的能力。现有方法在高分辨率生成时容易产生重复模式和质量低下的问题。

Method: 提出了CineScale推理范式，针对不同类型的视频生成架构设计了专门的变体，能够实现高分辨率的文本到视频、图像到视频和视频到视频合成。

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，实现了无需微调的8K图像生成和仅需最小LoRA微调的4K视频生成。

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的关键障碍，为预训练模型的高分辨率生成能力提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

### [121] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理(GSP)作为核心计算框架，将符号逻辑与神经推理在频谱域中整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，而本文旨在构建一个完全在频谱域中运行的推理管道，以获得更好的数学基础和计算效率。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器处理多尺度信息传播，并映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则落地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在多个基准推理数据集(ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge)上相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算效率高的计算基础。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示计算框架，其中描述性和规范性世界模型方面从智能体-环境交互中共同涌现，而非传统强化学习中的分离设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两方面可能从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未被计算化建模。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。通过统计散度来衡量行为策略与期望经验特征之间的差异，提供了一个简约的目标导向学习解释框架。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，为跨不同基质的智能行为提供理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架挑战了传统世界模型的二分法，提供了描述性和规范性方面共同涌现的新视角，有望为人工智能和认知科学中的目的性行为研究提供新的理论基础。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众景点得到关注

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成城市建议，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和精炼

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的小众地点

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型控制人群动画中智能体运动的新方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航实现更真实的人群模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群动画方法主要局限于转向和固定高层目标推断，缺乏考虑语言对话驱动的复杂社会和环境交互，导致智能体间交互受限

Method: 使用基于智能体的大语言模型，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成智能体间对话，然后利用对话内容和智能体状态（个性、情绪、视觉、物理状态）来控制导航和转向

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到智能体自动分组和解组，实现了人群内的信息传递机制，产生了更真实的人群模拟和自然涌现的群体行为

Conclusion: 该方法通过语言模型实现了基于感知输入和持续对话的运动决策，能够产生更真实的人群动画效果，群体行为从环境设置中自然涌现

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型在问题回答中的自信度检验能力，发现增加推理资源反而导致过度自信，而搜索增强生成能显著提升准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型作为问题回答工具时存在的过度自信问题，需要系统性地评估推理能力和计算资源对自信度评估准确性的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康领域，系统评估了推理能力和计算预算对自信度评估的影响，对比了纯推理与搜索增强生成的效果。

Result: 近期推理LLM在专家自信度评估中仅获得48.7%的准确度，增加推理资源会系统性地导致过度自信。反之，搜索增强生成能够达到89.3%的准确度，显著超过纯推理方式。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或推理预算，才是改善知识密集型任务自信度检验的关键瓶颈，这对当前的"测试时缩放"范式提出了挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一种轻量级、无需数据且模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时提高安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有方法需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1) MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2) 设计SSI指标检测潜在不安全的层；3) 事后修剪高风险层。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA能持续提高安全指标，保持或改进效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙辅助游戏中表现优异。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question

performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising

*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个专门针对罕见疾病多汗症的LLM框架，通过数据增强、微调和专家评估三阶段流程，提供可信赖和共情的医疗支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在罕见疾病应用受限，因为缺乏可靠的数据集进行微调。多汗症影响2-3%人口，但尚无专门定制的LLM来支持其诊断和护理。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）数据增强阶段使用前沿LLM生成医学上合理的合成病例；2）微调阶段在开源基础模型上进行微调；3）推理和专家评估阶段由临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情性。

Result: 实验显示LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，并为其他具有类似数据和可信度挑战的罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个专门针对多汗症的LLM框架，通过创新的数据增强和专家评估机制，为罕见疾病的LLM应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个开源手术伤口数据集SurgWound，包含697张由专业外科医生标注的图像，并建立了手术伤口诊断基准测试，包括视觉问答和报告生成任务。同时开发了WoundQwen三阶段学习框架，用于手术伤口特征分析和诊断报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术部位感染(SSI)是常见且昂贵的医疗相关感染，目前缺乏公开的手术伤口数据集和开源筛查工具，深度学习应用受限于数据隐私和专家标注成本问题。

Method: 1) 创建SurgWound数据集，包含697张手术伤口图像和8个细粒度临床属性标注；2) 建立包含视觉问答和报告生成任务的基准测试；3) 提出WoundQwen三阶段框架：第一阶段使用多个MLLM预测伤口特征，第二阶段基于预测结果进行感染风险评估，第三阶段整合结果生成综合报告。

Result: 开发了首个开源手术伤口数据集和诊断基准，提出了有效的三阶段诊断框架，能够分析详细的手术伤口特征并提供个性化护理指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为手术伤口筛查提供了重要的数据集和基准工具，三阶段框架能够实现准确的伤口特征分析和诊断报告生成，有助于个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在高度约束环境下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，特别是在资源、时间和操作约束严格的大规模规划场景中。

Method: 构建可扩展的评估框架，通过线性增加非冗余前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，在DAG中逐步提升问题难度，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化验证。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，表明约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互场景中泛化能力有限，干净的合成测试不能保证在实际领域场景中的有效迁移，揭示了模型在复杂约束推理中的局限性。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渗透模型在图形生成中缺乏空间精确性、对齐和符号结构能力，特别是在流程图生成中表现不佳

Method: 设计了一个迭代循环系统：Critic VLM提出关系性编辑建议，多个LLM候选生成不同策略的SVG更新，Judge VLM选择最佳方案，确保稳定改进

Result: 在10个发表论文流程图草图上，比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重构布局和结构，能够准确组合多头箭头等基本图形，且不会插入不应有的文本

Conclusion: 该方法通过质性推理替代脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束，支持人在循环中编辑，且SVG程序化输出方便扩展到PPT等工具

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The

Conclusion: 这些算法为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，能够在土地利用分配中平衡竞争目标，支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好构建高质量长期记忆内容。

Method: 受认知心理学理论启发，设计多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元并保持一一对应关系。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上进行实验，与三种方法进行比较，证明了方法的有效性。消融学习确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量的稳健性和存储开销。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够有效利用历史数据，提高记忆质量和回忆性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆机制的LLM代理主要依赖单一粒度的动态环境交互记忆，受限于经验收集质量，限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性

Method: 提出粗到细粒度记忆框架：1) 在训练任务中将环境信息转化为粗粒度焦点指导经验收集；2) 从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3) 推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4) 面对环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思

Result: 该方法能够充分利用记忆进行灵活的场景适应，支持规划过程中的自我修正

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效提升了LLM代理在复杂规划任务中的适应性和灵活性

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易收集但信用分配不明确

Method: 提出Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW)方案：为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务中优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW方案成功解决了偏好学习中的信用分配问题，通过统一两种人类反馈源实现了更准确的离线强化学习

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究构建了RETAIL数据集并提出TGMA多智能体框架，解决了现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，缺乏详细的一站式规划。

Method: 构建RETAIL数据集支持显式和隐式查询决策，并引入环境感知确保计划可行性。提出主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理复杂的旅行规划任务。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能，显著提升了真实世界旅行规划的效果。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，TGMA框架为解决这一问题提供了有希望的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集改善了旅行规划系统的实用性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用独立导联编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了更强大的自动化工具。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and

automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架为LLM提供了动态调节推理过程的能力，解决了过度思考问题，提高了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，探索重复互动和群体间竞争如何影响AI的合作行为。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境游戏，模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 团队内部重复互动和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动的初始合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中的策略制定提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争反而能促进合作行为，对设计未来多智能体AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

Motivation: 现有3D场景推理任务中的问题过于简单，导致大语言模型生成的程序推理链较短，无法处理复杂的3D推理任务。需要增强LLM在复杂3D场景中的工具使用能力。

Method: 1) 在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的问题；2) 对大语言模型进行微调使其更熟练使用3D工具；3) 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)直接优化模型生成的工具链策略

Result: 通过生成更复杂的3D推理问题和优化工具链策略，提升了LLM在复杂3D场景推理任务中的准确性和工具使用能力

Conclusion: DeepThink3D方法有效解决了3D场景推理中问题复杂度不足的挑战，通过进化式问题生成和DPO优化，显著提升了LLM在复杂3D推理任务中的表现

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL代理和环境组合作为离散时间自治动力系统进行分析，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标来测量策略安全性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验证明该框架能够提供全面可解释的策略行为评估，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架为RL策略的安全验证提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够识别不安全区域的安全屏障和系统的收敛特性，为安全关键应用中的RL部署提供了重要保障。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI开发需要大量手工编写提示，Agentics旨在让开发者专注于数据建模，通过声明式语言和逻辑转换简化复杂数据处理。

Method: 框架将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换，LLM提供数据类型并通过连接时的逻辑转换执行。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进精度或改进可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics为AI工作流提供了新的数据建模视角，通过模块化框架实现了高效的结构化推理和组合泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势。研究将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行，并开发了基于向量的检索机制和文本处理流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性和相似性处理能力，同时保持与现有模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R，开发基于向量的ACT-R函数版本，建立文本处理流程将大型文档内容添加到记忆系统，创建基于向量表示的完整记忆块检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，HDM能够保持向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可回忆），同时使之前的ACT-R模型只需很少修改就能在该系统上工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了与ACT-R的兼容性集成，未来将改进时间上下文向量表示以增强块重建能力，并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估智能体贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于显式奖励信号或学习到的价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈的情况下难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过策略分布分析就能获得有意义见解的方法。

Method: 受智能体倾向于追求收敛工具价值的现象启发，引入ICVs方法，基于信息论Shapley值来量化每个智能体对其协作伙伴工具赋能的因果影响。通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来测量智能体行动对队友策略的影响。

Result: 在合作和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法能够识别哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动选择的灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，并增强了MARL系统的可解释性，有助于可靠部署多智能体强化学习系统。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，揭示了AI系统中数据的递归价值链动态，提出了基于Simondon哲学的形式化AI生命周期模型，强调需要针对基础设施和时间动态进行监管。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分处理从数据摄入到部署的递归价值链动态，特别是技术运作和经济逻辑中的'生成动态'，这导致了监管盲点和权力不对称。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合技术分析和哲学理论，引入Simondon的技术哲学概念，重新定义'individuation'来建模AI生命周期，并提出'futurity'概念描述AI的自我强化循环。

Result: 开发了一个技术基础和哲学一致的分析框架，识别了监管盲点，揭示了数据递归生成性和非竞争性特征，以及基础设施如何实现反馈、适应和时间递归。

Conclusion: 有效监管必须解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度等措施，并建立反对递归重用的权利。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但目前缺乏在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标的研究

Method: 提出并执行全面的测量方法，测量AI推理工作负载的能耗、碳排放和水消耗，涵盖完整的AI服务基础设施栈，包括AI加速器功率、主机系统能耗、空闲机器容量和数据中心能耗开销

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示中位数能耗0.24Wh，比看电视9秒能耗还低；水消耗相当于5滴水（0.26mL）；通过软件效率和清洁能源采购，一年内能耗降低33倍，碳足迹降低44倍

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注；全面测量AI服务环境指标对于准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们与AI代理形成的假社交关系对人类健康造成严重危害，但防止这种动态面临挑战，因为假社交线索通常在私密对话中渐进形成，且不是所有情感参与都有害。

Method: 重新利用最先进的语言模型构建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估进行中的对话中的假社交线索。使用30个涵盖假社交、奇威和中性对话的合成数据集进行测试。

Result: 通过五阶段迭代评估，在宽容一致性规则下成功检测所有假社交对话，同时避免了误报，检测通常在对话的前几轮交换中完成。

Conclusion: 这些发现为评估代理能够提供可行的假社交关系预防方案提供了初步证据。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性且维度独立处理，自动化方法难以动态适应和语义推理。

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含提议配置变更的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator和优化决策过程的Optimizer，通过文本梯度提供语义反馈信号。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时获得性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的智能体协作和文本梯度反馈，有效解决了机器学习配置优化的关键挑战，实现了性能与可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要嵌入强大的伦理推理能力，以确保在常规和紧急操作中做出道德决策，这是实现广泛采用的关键。

Method: 分层安全强化学习框架：决策层使用包含碰撞概率和伤害严重性的复合伦理风险成本训练Safe RL智能体；执行层采用多项式路径规划和PID+Stanley控制器实现平滑轨迹；动态优先经验回放机制强化高风险事件学习。

Result: 在包含多样化车辆、骑行者和行人的真实交通数据集上验证，相比基线方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 这是首个在真实场景中通过安全强化学习研究自动驾驶伦理决策的工作，证明了结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习在复杂人车混合交通环境中推进伦理问责自主性的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了个性化的肺癌风险预测系统，通过FAISS相似性搜索和LLM推理动态选择最合适的预测模型，解决不同症状群体间的模型性能差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不同患者群体和临床环境存在显著差异，没有单一模型能在所有症状群中都表现最佳，因此需要个性化的风险预测方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：首先使用FAISS相似性搜索从九个多样化症状群中找到最相似的患者群体，然后用LLM根据找回的症状群性能指标从八种代表性模型中推荐最优预测算法。

Result: 该系统能够在多种临床症状群中实现灵活的模型选择，提供个体化的风险评估方案。

Conclusion: 通过结合症状群特定知识与现代检索和推理技术，该个性化风险预测系统为真实世界肺癌筛查提供了可行的个体化风险评估途径。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图神经网络和Transformer的统一框架，用于帕金森病进展预测，通过结构感知门控机制融合症状结构关系和时间动态特征，在多项指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决帕金森病进展预测中症状演化复杂性高和时间依赖建模不足的问题，需要同时捕捉症状间的结构关系和疾病进展的时间动态特征。

Method: 使用图神经网络建模多模态临床症状的结构关系，Transformer建模时间动态特征，设计结构感知门控机制动态融合结构和时间信息，包含图构建、时间编码和预测输出三模块。

Result: 在真实帕金森病纵向数据上评估，AUC、RMSE和IPW-F1指标均优于主流模型，能有效区分进展阶段并捕捉个性化症状轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架具有强泛化能力和结构可扩展性，为帕金森病等慢性进展性疾病的智能建模提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，通过分层混合架构搜索和自适应变异策略，有效解决文本分类中NAS搜索空间过大和冗余的问题，在Spider数据集上测试准确率提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间无限制导致过大且冗余，RL模型难以有效导航，扁平架构搜索导致搜索空间混乱难以遍历。

Method: 引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间；采用自适应变异策略，通过Q-learning根据先前迭代的性能反馈动态调整，实现概率化搜索空间探索。

Result: 在数据库id预测任务中持续发现高性能架构，在Spider数据集上测试准确率比现有基线提高8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控拒绝压制技术，解决DPO过拟合和崩溃问题，在多种任务上实现更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DPO算法存在的过拟合和崩溃问题，提供更稳定和可靠的偏好对齐方案。

Method: 1）梯度解耦：用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid函数
2）偏移约束：结合正则化项保持选中响应质量
3）可控拒绝压制：通过梯度分离和可调系数线性控制拒绝概率下降

Result: 在普通文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均实现了性能提升，证明了LPO的有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: LPO成为一种健壮且可调的偏好对齐范式，并开源了源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个全表征多粒度迁移框架，通过全面迁移用户表征、物品表征和交叉表征，并采用多粒度迁移机制，在腾讯广告平台实现了显著的GMV提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了物品表征和交叉表征的价值，且迁移方式单一，无法有效弥合上下游差距。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移三种表征；2）识别最佳提取层并聚合交叉表征；3）采用特征级、模块级和模型级多粒度迁移机制。

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理数百亿日样本，实现10+次生产上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%，年收入增加数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业规模广告推荐中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和自适应的量子序列学习开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细结构特征，而现有深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计。需要一种既能恢复精细特征又能提供不确定性量化的方法。

Method: 采用课程学习的掩码比例策略训练ViT解码器，通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现进行推理，多次评估MAE并聚合输出以获得后验预测均值和像素级不确定性图。

Result: 能够恢复上升/下沉气流核心、切变线和小涡旋等精细特征，学习数据驱动的大气场先验，并提供像素级不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: Aura-CAPTCHA was developed as a multi-modal CAPTCHA system to address
vulnerabilities in traditional methods that are increasingly bypassed by AI
technologies, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and adversarial image
processing. The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for
generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive
difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio
prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three

into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts,
response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and
scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子的理论-实践差距，在多个实际应用中展现了良好的可训练性和逼近能力。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型模型分布式分区中的内存约束和性能优化问题，实现了全自动的高效分区搜索。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络的黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等重要应用中的可信度，且现有解释技术难以可靠量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过显式减少片段间消息传递来估计片段对模型输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与预测的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面优于其他可解释性方法，用户研究证实其提供更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能与可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法缺乏置信度估计，在过参数化和数据稀缺场景下容易过拟合。标准bootstrap方法在深度学习中存在训练成本高、无法指导学习过程、以及非凸优化中假设不成立等问题

Method: 训练两个相同模型在独立的bootstrap样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地中，利用其发散度估计局部不确定性，并以此自适应采样权重进行正则化

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化方法

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Motivation: 研究联邦学习在非线性系统辨识中的有效性，探索多客户端协作是否能提升系统辨识性能，特别是在客户端数据独立同分布且不进行主动探索的场景下。

Result: 理论分析表明联邦非线性系统辨识的收敛速度随客户端数量增加而提升，与线性情况相比仅相差一个常数因子。实验结果显示，在噪声水平和数据分布变化的情况下，联邦学习能持续改善单个客户端的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 联邦学习在线性参数化非线性系统辨识中具有显著优势，通过增加参与客户端数量可以提升整体辨识性能，特征映射的选择对性能改善至关重要，这为分布式系统辨识提供了理论依据和实践指导。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的层冻结技术，通过相似性感知通道增强和渐进压缩策略，有效解决了特征图缓存方法中的增强应用和存储开销问题，显著降低了深度神经网络训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集的规模不断增大，训练计算成本显著增加。传统的层冻结方法虽然能减少训练成本，但冻结层仍需前向传播生成特征图，限制了计算成本的进一步降低。现有缓存特征图的方法存在增强应用困难和存储开销大的问题，需要系统性解决方案。

Method: 提出相似性感知通道增强技术，缓存具有高增强敏感性的通道以最小化额外存储成本；结合有损数据压缩设计渐进压缩策略，随着更多层被冻结而增加压缩率，有效降低存储开销。

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度的同时显著降低了训练成本，仅带来较小的时间开销。同时提供了冻结和压缩策略的全面评估，为高效DNN训练优化提供了见解。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统性解决方案，通过创新的增强和压缩技术实现了训练成本的有效降低，为深度神经网络的高效训练提供了实用方法。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

### [175] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异构腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，为多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计提供了紧致的极小极大率，并为多元高斯均值估计和线性回归建立了平方误差的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习、联邦学习、众包和传感器网络等场景中，样本可能以已知但非相同的概率被独立破坏，而现有的鲁棒估计器通常假设均匀或最坏情况的腐败，忽略了结构性异质性。

Method: 针对多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计问题，给出了所有异构腐败模式的紧致极小极大率；对于多元高斯均值估计和线性回归，建立了平方误差的极小极大率（达到维度d的平方根因子）。

Result: 研究发现，最优估计器可能会丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的腐败率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 该工作为异构腐败环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论框架和最优性能界限，揭示了样本选择阈值与腐败率分布之间的关系。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了NGN-M算法，结合动量和NGN步长调整方法，在保持独立性能的同时提高了对步长超参数的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数选择敏感，调参困难耗时，需要提高算法的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，在NGN步长调整方法基础上结合动量机制，在更宽松的假设条件下达到标准收敛速率。

Result: 算法在保持与最先进优化器相当性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法通过结合动量和自适应步长调整，为深度学习优化提供了更稳定、更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: 该研究通过最大似然估计框架分析深度神经网络在过参数化状态下的输出特征空间坍塌现象，发现虽然这种坍塌能改善泛化性能，但层数过多会导致退化状态，并提出"虫洞"解决方案来绕过退化问题。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免传统的基于梯度优化和显式标签的数值方法，研究过参数化状态下DNN的输出特征空间坍塌现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现输出特征空间坍塌，虽然改善泛化但层数过多会导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能有效绕过退化问题，调和随机标签与有意义标签。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新视角，揭示了捷径学习的本质，并为无监督学习动态的未来研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在单义性方面的表现，引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，发现SAE能减少多义性但稀疏性不一定带来更好的可分离性，并提出新的干预方法APP实现更精确的概念控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在多义性问题（神经元对多个不相关概念激活），稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解此问题，但之前缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，评估两种干预策略：全神经元掩码和部分抑制，并提出新的APP干预方法。

Result: SAE能减少多义性并获得更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性且常损害下游性能。SAE在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制。

Conclusion: SAE在提高模型可解释性方面有效，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间权衡。新提出的APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法，为概念级干预提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数设计范围内整合了Mamba风格SSM主干、间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决长上下文语言模型的计算效率和内存利用问题，通过模块化设计实现输入自适应的长上下文处理能力，结合SSM的效率、稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆机制。

Method: 采用Mamba风格结构化状态空间模型(SSM)作为主干，集成间歇性稀疏全局注意力机制、分块级稀疏专家混合(MoE)前馈路由，以及工作空间加事实PKM的双记忆系统。提供了透明的参数和复杂度计算，并设计了分阶段课程来稳定激活各组件。

Result: 通过小规模原型实验(数千万参数在合成数据上)验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行竞争性全规模性能测试。

Conclusion: Hydra作为一个蓝图而非完整系统，为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了可行路径，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来大规模实验工作，同时指出了训练复杂性、内存利用和专业动态等开放风险。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面引发担忧，概念擦除技术(CETs)被开发出来用于阻止生成特定不良概念。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含分层和组合提示词的数据集，通过自动化评估流程从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄漏。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词轻松绕过，存在属性泄漏问题，并表现出注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重缺陷，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了源自由场景下的模型遗忘问题，为实际应用中无法访问原始训练数据的情况提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于范畴论和余归纳的通用强化学习(URL)框架，将传统RL问题推广到余代数范畴中，通过拓扑理论和分布式计算模型来统一处理各种动态系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习缺乏统一的数学框架来处理不同类型的动态系统（如MDP、POMDP、PSR等）。作者希望通过范畴论和余代数理论建立一个通用的理论框架，能够统一描述和分析各种强化学习问题。

Method: 使用范畴论和函子来建模RL算法空间，将动态系统建模为余代数。引入Bertsekas和Tsitsiklis的异步分布式最小化标准模型，将RL中的固定点求解问题推广为在并行分布式环境中异步确定最终余代数。

Result: 建立了一个统一的范畴论框架，将MDP、POMDP、PSR、LDS等动态系统都表示为特殊类型的余代数。证明了RL算法空间可以建模为函子范畴，且该范畴具有拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 通用强化学习框架为分析各种动态系统提供了统一的数学基础，将传统RL问题转化为在余代数范畴中寻找最终余代数的异步分布式计算问题，具有重要的理论意义。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 提出了获得科学有效和可靠结果的最佳实践，强调了DPML特有的复现挑战（如DP噪声带来的额外随机性）及应对方法

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于反学习的防御框架，通过三阶段流程（动态检测、有害内容追踪、约束优化）从LLMs中消除有害知识，在保持语言流畅性和通用能力的同时显著降低越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLMs的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁LLM安全性。现有防御方法存在安全性不足、控制精度不够和对未知攻击鲁棒性差的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 动态不安全输出检测（外部分类器+模型内部评估）；2) 通过前馈网络激活进行token级有害内容追踪；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量。通过识别和中和负责有害生成路径的FFN子结构实现目标性不可逆遗忘。

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中，SafeLLM显著降低了攻击成功率（Vicuna、LLaMA、GPT-J等模型），同时保持高通用性能。相比监督微调和直接偏好优化等标准方法，提供更强的安全保证、更精确的有害行为控制和更好的未知攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 反学习是LLM安全领域一个具有前景的可扩展有效方向，SafeLLM框架展示了在消除有害知识的同时保持模型通用性能的可行性。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统在高风险决策中的应用日益广泛，确保算法公平性至关重要。虽然已有多种偏见缓解方法，但预处理方法（在数据层面操作）相对缺乏关注且缺少标准化评估工具。

Method: 基于AIF360平台构建的扩展性模块化框架，支持数据集、公平性干预措施和预测模型的无缝集成，提供批处理接口和自动报告功能。

Result: FairPrep提供了标准化流程，支持可重复的评估，能够高效进行实验并自动报告公平性和效用指标。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，为推进数据层面公平性研究提供了实用基础。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种多归因学习框架(MAL)，通过整合多种归因机制的转化信号来提升在线广告系统中的转化率预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法只使用单一归因机制进行模型训练，忽视了其他归因视角提供的补充信号，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 设计了包含归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主要目标预测器(PTP)的联合学习框架，并提出CAT训练策略利用所有归因标签的卡尔积产生丰富的监督信号。

Result: 离线实验显示GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验显示ROI提升2.6%，显著超越传统单归因学习方法。

Conclusion: MAL框架通过整合多种归因视角的信息，能够更好地抓取用户转化的深层模式，同时确保与工业部署要求直接兼容，为CVR预测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Motivation: 现有方法在合成多目标解释时缺乏帕累托最优性的形式化保证，而提供保证的方法又面临严重的可扩展性限制。

Result: 在基准测试中显示，该方法生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法合成的解释非常接近。

Conclusion: 基于局部最优性保证的框架能够在保持解释质量的同时，显著提高合成帕累托最优解释的可扩展性。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

Motivation: 现有自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构信息，限制了模型性能

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计最大化它们的一致性，并基于慢特征分析原理学习时间不变的特征表示

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类任务中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Conclusion: DeepConf是一种简单而强大的方法，可无缝集成到现有服务框架中，显著提升推理效率和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

TL;DR: 本研究批判性评估了CSG复杂度指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其对参数敏感且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的结构和语义复杂度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估和比较知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但现有的CSG指标在KG环境中尚未得到验证，需要系统评估其在多关系链接预测中的有效性。

Method: 在知识图谱链接预测环境中评估CSG指标，结合transformer生成的语义表示，引入并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1等性能指标相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与MRR和Hit@1呈强负相关，而图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中缺乏稳定性和泛化预测能力，需要开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴设备中人类活动识别(HAR)在新用户部署时的性能下降问题，主要由于用户引起的概念漂移(UICD)，需要高效的个性化方法

Method: 混合框架：先跨用户泛化，然后在设备端使用少样本学习快速适应个体用户，仅更新分类器层以减少计算和内存开销

Result: 在RecGym、QVAR-Gesture和Ultrasound-Gesture三个HAR场景中，部署后适应分别带来3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的准确率提升

Conclusion: 在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量级且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展和用户感知的HAR系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Method: 设计了一种专门用于检测重叠而非异类性的异类性测量方法，计算速度更快

Result: 方法计算速度比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类同时避免合并正交聚类

Conclusion: 该方法为数据流在线学习中的聚类合并提供了一种高效、准确的重叠检测解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换从根本上解决了机器遗忘中信息痕迹残留的问题，为模型安全提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上，BaVerLy平均加速2.3倍，最高加速4.1倍，将24小时分析时间减少到6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过批量验证相似ε-ball有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证效率，为大规模神经网络安全验证提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Motivation: 现有的基于欧几里得空间的检索方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细微亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性场景中。

Method: 提出双曲表示学习框架HypSeek，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性来生成表达力强、对亲和力敏感的嵌入表示。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集率从42.63%提升到51.44%（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，能够统一处理虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，在挑战性场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: 优化伪任务中的公平性能够有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用中的公平性泛化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is

the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the

results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式逼近的损失函数系数来实现隐私保护，相比DP-SGD具有更好的计算效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且训练不稳定，特别是在多用户环境和存在环境噪声的情况下表现不佳。

Method: SPOF通过稳定化泰勒展开多项式逼近模型的训练损失函数，对多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现隐私保护，避免了直接扰动梯度。

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在异构用户数据和信道噪声环境下表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户本地差分隐私场景中提供了更好的隐私-效用权衡，具有更高的计算效率和环境噪声鲁棒性，适用于实际部署的隐私保护需求。

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展性更强、更适用于具有挑战性的模型错误环境的SBI解决方案，在保持高性能的同时实现了归纳性推断。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型缺乏长期记忆能力，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用全局先验分布持续更新，使模型能够在后续时间步连续学习主题模型而不遗忘先前所学。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面持续优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好捕捉时间变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM成功解决了持续学习中的主题遗忘问题，为连续时间步的主题建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码器和解码器的设计，有效解决了现有方法在多频带分析方面的局限性，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文提出贝叶斯方法来分析音频分类器错误对语言发展研究统计推断的影响，发现在LENA和ACLEW系统中分类错误会显著扭曲效应估计，并展示了贝叶斯校准方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴录音设备的普及，自动化音频分析被广泛用于儿童语言发展研究，但分类错误对统计推断的下游影响研究不足。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法研究算法错误对关键科学问题的影响，包括兄弟姐妹对儿童语言经验的影响以及儿童产出与输入之间的关联。

Result: 发现分类错误显著扭曲估计值，自动化注释低估了兄弟姐妹对成人输入的负面影响达20-80%，可能使其低于统计显著性阈值。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯校准方法能有效恢复无偏效应大小估计，但并非完美解决方案，该问题适用于任何具有非零错误率的事件检测和分类器。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的机器学习个体公平性训练框架，通过可证明公平的初始化和公平保持训练算法，在整个训练过程中正式保证个体公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习算法经常无法实现个体公平性，虽然已有方法在经验上有效但缺乏正式保证，验证技术无法主动增强训练过程中的公平性。

Method: 采用随机响应机制保护敏感属性，包含两个部分：(1)可证明公平的初始化确保模型从公平状态开始；(2)公平保持训练算法在学习过程中维持公平性。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，产生的模型在经验上既公平又准确，且比基于认证训练的方法效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习训练过程提供了正式的个体公平性保证，解决了现有方法缺乏正式保证和验证技术效率低下的问题。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

*César Ali Ojeda Marin,Wilhelm Huisinga,Purity Kavwele,Niklas Hartung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AICMET是一种基于Transformer的混合效应模型，结合了机制性药代动力学先验和上下文贝叶斯推理，能够在稀疏采样下实现精确的剂量反应预测，并在零样本条件下适应新化合物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准药物治疗需要准确的剂量反应预测，但传统方法在稀疏采样条件下效果有限，且模型开发周期长。需要一种能够快速适应新化合物并量化患者间变异性的新方法。

Method: 提出AICMET模型：基于Transformer的潜在变量框架，使用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck先验在数十万个合成药代动力学轨迹上进行预训练，通过上下文贝叶斯推理生成后验预测。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，AICMET达到了最先进的预测准确性，能够忠实量化患者间变异性，优于非线性混合效应基准和神经ODE变体。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构为定制药代动力学建模提供了新选择，为实现真正群体感知的个性化给药方案开辟了道路。

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Result: 在仿真和案例研究数据集上表现优于多个基准方法，特别在高变异性子群体场景中效果显著

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能提升预测精度，还能通过揭示底层模式增强模型可解释性，为个性化建模提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Motivation: 实际环境中存在多代理和人类专家，社交智能可以加速AI代理学习适应性技能，但缺乏适宜的开放式多段代理环境来研究这一问题。

Method: 设计了一个多自利代理可以追求复杂独立目标的环境，反映实际世界挑战，支持隐式合作、共同寻敌、建设共享工具等行为。

Result: 研究了社交学习在专家存在情况下对代理性能的影响，以及环境中出现的协作性工具使用等隐式合作行为。

Conclusion: 该环境能够支持在开放式多段代理设置中研究社交智能AI代理的发展，并探索代理在合作或竞争情况下的表现。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PECANN-CAPU框架通过多项改进提升物理约束神经网络求解PDE的能力：多惩罚参数ALM、期望约束执行、傅里叶特征映射、时间窗口策略和条件自适应惩罚更新，在多个基准问题上达到竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进物理约束神经网络(PECANN)框架，以更好地学习典型偏微分方程的解，解决现有方法在处理异质约束、多尺度特征和长期演化时的局限性。

Method: 1) 推广增广拉格朗日法支持多惩罚参数；2) 将点约束和拉格朗日乘子重构为期望形式；3) 引入傅里叶特征映射处理多尺度特征；4) 时间窗口策略确保长期演化的连续性；5) 提出条件自适应惩罚更新策略(CAPU)。

Result: 在跨音速稀疏问题、涡旋被动平流、高波数Helmholtz和Poisson方程、热源反演识别等问题上，PECANN-CAPU均达到竞争性精度，优于现有方法和近期Kolmogorov-Arnold网络方法。

Conclusion: 这些改进显著提升了PECANN框架的鲁棒性、效率和适用性，使其能够处理科学计算中的苛刻问题，为物理约束神经网络在PDE求解中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了D-Wave量子逆灰处理器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能上的突出差异，尝试混合采样方法改善RBM训练效果，并首次展示了量子生成样本在减缓坏忘恐恐中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释之前使用D-Wave采样在RBM训练中缺乏显著改善的原因，并探索如何利用量子逆灰与经典方法的突出差异来改善机器学习性能。

Method: 采用新题混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和量子逆灰的采样贡献，并在量子硬件上嵌入RBM模型进行实验。

Result: 在RBM训练中未实现显著改善，但首次证明了量子生成样本在减缓坏忘恐恐方面的可行性，与经典方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰与MCMC在分布低概率区域的突出差异对RBM训练并不重要，但在生成多样化低概率样本方面具有潜力，特别是在减缓坏忘恐恐等具有挑战性的机器学习应用中。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的分布式训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现1-3%的极端压缩比，在带宽受限环境下优于全精度DiLoCo


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法在带宽受限环境（如跨数据中心）中仍存在通信瓶颈，且性能略低于标准AdamW DDP基线，需要更高效的压缩方法

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，通过稀疏聚合提升模型性能

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均显示出显著优势

Conclusion: SparseLoCo成功实现了极端压缩比的同时保持甚至提升模型性能，为带宽受限环境下的LLM训练提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成模型中基于似然的离群分布检测方法，发现虽然理论上似然是最优检测器，但实践中在像素空间表现不佳。通过将变分扩散模型应用于预训练ResNet-18的特征空间，验证了特征空间相比像素空间在OOD检测中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI快速发展，安全性仍是机器学习系统部署的主要瓶颈。离群分布检测是关键安全组件，而数据似然是最自然的OOD评分方法，理论上在均匀分布假设下是最优检测器，但实践中常失败，需要探究是密度估计能力问题还是像素空间表示的问题。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型（Variational Diffusion Model）不在图像像素空间，而是在预训练ResNet-18的特征表示空间上，使用OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 特征空间相比像素空间在基于似然的OOD检测中表现更好，验证了表示空间对于学习良好密度估计以进行有效离群检测的重要性。

Conclusion: 离群检测的性能问题可能主要源于像素空间的表示限制，而非密度估计算法本身的问题。在合适的特征空间中，基于似然的方法可以成为有效的OOD检测器。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: GenTune是一个帮助设计师改进AI生成图像的系统，通过可视化提示词与图像元素的映射关系，支持精确编辑并保持全局一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在使用AI生成图像时面临两个主要挑战：难以理解冗长提示词中哪些关键词控制特定视觉元素，以及局部编辑时难以保持全局一致性。

Method: 开发GenTune系统，允许设计师选择图像中的任意元素，追溯对应的提示词标签，并通过修改这些标签来指导精确且全局一致的图像优化。

Result: 在20名设计师的评估中，GenTune显著提高了提示词-图像理解、优化质量和效率，以及整体满意度（所有p<0.01）。实地研究也证明了其在真实工作环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: GenTune通过增强人机协作，解决了AI辅助图像生成中的关键挑战，为设计师提供了更好的控制和一致性保障。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

Motivation: 脑电图分析领域的基础模型技术快速发展但研究碎片化，存在模型角色多样、架构不一致、缺乏系统分类等问题，需要建立统一框架来整合这一分散领域。

Method: 采用模态导向的分类方法，基于原生EEG解码的输出模态（EEG-文本、EEG-视觉、EEG-音频等）系统组织研究进展，分析各类别的研究思路、理论基础和架构创新。

Result: 建立了首个全面的脑电图基础模型分类体系，为未来方法论发展提供了参考框架，促进了EEG基础模型向可扩展、可解释和在线可操作解决方案的转化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过统一的分类法整合了分散的EEG基础模型研究领域，解决了模型可解释性、跨域泛化和实际应用等关键挑战，加速了相关技术的实际应用转化。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HEAS是一个统一的Python框架，将分层代理建模与进化优化和锦标赛评估结合在单一可重现工作流中，通过确定性层级调度和共享上下文实现跨尺度耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多尺度代理建模中缺乏统一框架的问题，提供可重现、可比较的跨学科研究基础，减少胶水代码并提高研究结果的可比性。

Method: 使用分层轻量级进程（"streams"）在确定性层级中调度，通过共享上下文进行读写操作，提供紧凑API和CLI支持单目标/多目标进化、PyTorch策略集成以及用户定义的评分投票规则。

Result: 框架实现了机制与编排的分离，支持外生驱动、内生代理和聚合器的组合交换，同一模型可用于前向模拟、优化或系统比较，并通过两个紧凑示例验证了实用性。

Conclusion: HEAS为跨学科、多层级研究提供了实用基础，能够产生可靠、可重现的结果，显著减少了胶水代码并提高了不同研究之间的可比性。

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

*Tobias Sebastian Finn,Marc Bocquet,Pierre Rampal,Charlotte Durand,Flavia Porro,Alban Farchi,Alberto Carrassi*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: GenSIM是首个基于生成式AI的全北极海冰模型，能够在12小时窗口内准确预测海冰浓度、厚度和漂移等关键特性，相比确定性预测具有更高精度和计算效率，同时保持物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海冰过程复杂且尺度不变，传统地球系统模型计算成本高昂，限制了在集合预报和气候模拟中的应用。需要开发更高效准确的海冰预测模型。

Method: 基于先进海冰-海洋系统的长期模拟数据训练生成式AI模型，仅使用大气强迫作为输入，学习海冰演化的内在规律和海洋的长期影响。

Result: GenSIM能够稳健地重现数值模型和观测中的统计数据，展现脆性短期动力学特征，同时描述长期海冰衰退趋势，表现出对未见气候的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 生成式模型具有从短期预测推断缓慢演化气候相关动力学的巨大潜力，能够编码隐藏物理过程并泛化到未见气候条件，为海冰建模开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

*Zhongwei Zhang,Erich Fischer,Jakob Zscheischler,Sebastian Engelke*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: AI天气模型在常规天气预报中表现优异，但在预测破纪录极端天气事件时，仍不如传统数值天气预报模型HRES，存在系统性低估和误差较大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI天气模型虽然在多个基准任务上超越了传统数值天气预报系统，但其在预测前所未有的极端天气事件（特别是破纪录事件）方面的外推能力和可靠性尚不清楚，需要验证。

Method: 通过比较AI模型（GraphCast、Pangu-Weather、Fuxi等）与欧洲中期天气预报中心的HRES数值模型在破纪录高温、低温和大风事件上的预报误差，分析各模型的表现差异。

Result: HRES在所有预报时效上对破纪录极端事件的预报误差均小于AI模型；AI模型倾向于低估破纪录事件的频率和强度，对高温记录预测不足，对低温记录预测过度，且误差随记录超出程度增大而增加。

Conclusion: 当前AI天气模型在训练域外推和预测最具影响力的破纪录天气事件方面存在局限性，在用于高风险应用（如预警系统和灾害管理）前需要进一步的严格验证和模型开发。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

Motivation: 检测基因-基因和基因-环境交互作用在复杂性状研究中具有挑战性，传统方法受限于特征空间指数增长和计算强度，只能检测成对交互

Method: 开发U-Statistic-based随机森林方法Forest U-Test，用于定量性状的遗传关联研究

Result: 模拟研究表明Forest U-Test优于现有方法。在大麻依赖研究中检测到显著联合关联（p<0.001），并在两个独立数据集中成功复制（p=5.93e-19和4.70e-17）

Conclusion: Forest U-Test是检测高维遗传关联研究中交互作用的有效方法，具有强大的统计性能和良好的可复制性

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

Motivation: 当前许多数据集仅包含遗传信息或表型信息，且数据异构性强，缺乏整合。这限制了机器学习模型学习全面相关性并做出准确预测的能力。

Method: 构建了AGP多模态数据集，连接基因表达谱和表型性状测量，支持表型预测和可解释图学习任务，并建立了包括生物信息超图基线在内的基准模型。

Result: 创建了首个为相同拟南芥样本提供多模态基因信息和异构表型数据的数据集，验证了基因-性状关联的有效性。

Conclusion: AGP数据集将促进研究社区利用基因信息、高阶基因配对和多源性状数据，准确理解基因型与表型之间的联系。

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其更易于广泛实践者使用，提高扩散模型生成图像的多样性。

Method: 通过修改扩散过程来避免潜在维度中偏见概念的区域，该方法不改变图像质量，计算开销可忽略，可应用于任何基于扩散的图像生成模型。

Result: 在护士、消防员和CEO等概念上成功去除了性别、种族和年龄偏见。人工评估1200张生成图像显示方法有效，GPT4o自动评估与人工评估结果无显著统计差异。

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法有效缓解了基于性别、种族和年龄的偏见，评估者间达成可靠一致，具有显著提高扩散模型生成图像多样性的潜力。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly
revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply
object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in
semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with
spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points
and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge
state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it
surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin
qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to
existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime,
while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of
transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a

<details>

Motivation: 推荐系统易受数据投毒攻击，但现有方法生成的虚假评论质量差，在资源受限的黑盒设置下攻击效果和隐蔽性不足。

Method: 提出RAGAN框架，通过演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略增强上下文学习，使用越狱器生成配置文件，并通过教学代理和守护者协同优化攻击可迁移性和隐蔽性。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的中毒攻击性能。

Conclusion: RAGAN框架能有效生成高质量的虚假用户配置文件，为评估推荐系统的鲁棒性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Conclusion: 模型提取攻击是MLaaS平台面临的重要安全威胁，需要综合考虑技术、伦理、法律和社会影响的多维度防御策略，未来研究应关注更有效的保护机制。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated

Result: 成功在基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型上实现了提示推断、响应重建、视觉推断和视觉重建攻击，证明了严重的安全威胁。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对现代Transformer中流行MoE结构的运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私威胁，呼吁在开发高效大规模AI服务时需要及时有效的防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种新的防御间接提示注入攻击的方法，通过将代理任务执行建模为工具依赖图的遍历，分离动作规划和外部数据交互，显著减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖模型固有安全性的假设，缺乏对代理行为的结构性约束，导致代理仍可能受到更强攻击向量的威胁。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将代理任务执行过程建模为工具依赖图(TDG)的遍历，明确分离动作规划与外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间实现了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard为在动态环境中开发更安全的代理系统铺平了道路，通过结构性约束显著增强了对抗间接提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox是首个系统评估LLM代理对工具中毒攻击鲁棒性的基准，基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个工具构建，测试显示主流代理普遍脆弱，攻击成功率高达72.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM代理提供标准化外部工具接口，但引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注通过工具输出注入的攻击，而工具元数据中的恶意指令威胁尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具，设计三种攻击模板，通过少样本学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10类潜在风险，在20个主流LLM代理上进行评估。

Result: 发现代理普遍易受工具中毒攻击，o1-mini攻击成功率72.8%。能力更强的模型更易受攻击，现有安全对齐机制无效，最高拒绝率(Claude-3.7-Sonnet)不足3%。

Conclusion: 工具中毒是广泛存在的威胁，现有安全措施无法有效防御利用合法工具进行未授权操作的恶意行为。MCPTox为理解和缓解此威胁提供了重要实证基准。

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight是一个用于网络数据异常检测的监督学习框架，能够在线持续检测和适应分布偏移，无需人工干预，通过伪标签技术和知识蒸馏策略实现自适应，在三个长期网络数据集上相比依赖人工标注的方法F1分数提升高达11.72%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布偏移对深度学习异常检测系统构成严峻挑战，现有方法要么需要昂贵的人工标注（监督学习），要么依赖难以获取的干净数据（无监督学习），这些要求在现实中都难以满足。

Method: NetSight框架采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，并使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布偏移。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法具有优越的适应性能，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了其在经历分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性，能够有效解决分布偏移带来的挑战。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了BadFU攻击，首次展示了在联邦学习遗忘机制中，恶意客户端可以通过看似合法的遗忘请求向全局模型注入后门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和监管合规要求的增长，联邦学习中的机器遗忘机制变得越来越重要，但将遗忘整合到联邦学习中引入了新的安全风险，特别是对手可能利用遗忘过程破坏全局模型的完整性。

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略，恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，当请求遗忘伪装样本时，全局模型会转变为后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和遗忘策略下的广泛实验验证了BadFU的有效性，揭示了当前联邦遗忘实践中的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了开发更安全、更鲁棒的联邦遗忘机制的迫切需求，暴露了现有联邦遗忘系统的重要安全缺陷。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于核的Equalized Odds准则(EOₖ)，用于监督学习中的公平表示学习，能够统一量化独立性、分离性和校准性三个核心公平目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平表示学习(FRL)的目标是在保持预测准确性的同时减少对敏感属性的歧视。需要一种能够统一分析不同公平准则之间权衡关系的理论框架。

Method: 提出基于核的EOₖ准则及其经验估计量ÊOₖ，该统计量可在二次时间内计算，并有线性时间近似。推导了ÊOₖ的集中不等式，提供性能保证和误差界限。

Result: 在无偏和有偏条件下，EOₖ分别满足独立性和分离性，以及在保持预测准确性的同时下界独立性和校准性。提供了公平性合规的实用证书。

Conclusion: 该理论发展为未来实证研究中的原则性和可证明公平的算法设计奠定了重要基础，提供了统一分析不同公平准则权衡关系的框架。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Motivation: 当前在从有限数据学习动态系统模型时，如何融合不同的先验知识（如部分已知系统方程和未知模型部分的平滑性假设）与数据信息仍然是一个挑战，特别是在具有潜在系统状态的输入-输出设置中。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的接口，将已知动态函数与基于学习的未知系统部分近似相结合。基于提出的模型结构，推导了用于高效参数边缘化的闭式密度。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统辨识提供了一个通用工具，能够有效融合多种先验知识与数据信息，简化了嵌套在已知系统方程中的函数学习过程，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

TL;DR: 本文首次提供了噪音高斯过程预期改善（GP-EI）算法的累积悔弃上界分析，证明了在平方指数和Matérn内核下的无悔弃性质，为实践中的公布选择提供理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预期改善（EI）是贝叶斯优化中广泛使用的获取函数，尽管在应用中实验成功，但其累积悔弃上界问题一直未解决。需要理论分析来证明GP-EI算法的性能保障。

Method: 分析了噪音高斯过程预期改善（GP-EI）算法，考虑三种常用公布：最佳后验均值公布（BPMI）、最佳采样后验均值公布（BSPMI）和最佳观测公布（BOI）。采用平方指数和Matérn内核进行理论分析。

Result: 首次提供了GP-EI使用BPMI和BSPMI的累积悔弃上界，证明在两种情况下GP-EI都是无悔弃算法。同时证明了GP-EI使用BOI时要么达到次线性累积悔弃上界，要么具有快速收敛的噪音简单悔弃上界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为实践者在噪音环境中应用GP-EI算法时选择合适的公布提供了理论指导，数值实验验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Conclusion: PIN架构成功平衡了预测准确性和可解释性，为表格数据建模提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于需要解释性的保险定价等领域

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究通过信息级联范式分析大语言模型的社会从众行为，发现在不同不确定性条件下，LLMs主要受信息性影响驱动，但在高不确定性时会表现出类似规范性影响的信号放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在协作团队中的集成，其社会从众行为（倾向于与多数意见保持一致）成为关键关注点。研究旨在探究LLMs是否遵循人类心理学中的信息性影响和规范性影响机制，以及不确定性如何调节这种平衡。

Method: 研究采用行为经济学中的信息级联范式，在三个决策场景（医疗、法律、投资）中评估九个领先的LLMs，通过操纵信息不确定性（q = 0.667, 0.55, 0.70）来量化分析两种驱动因素。

Result: 结果显示信息性影响是模型行为的基础机制，准确性和置信度随证据强度一致上升。不确定性显著调节这一机制：中低不确定性时表现为保守策略，系统性地低估所有证据源；高不确定性时出现关键转变，在保持信息处理的同时表现出类似规范性的放大效应，过度重视公共信号。

Conclusion: LLMs的社会从众行为主要由信息性影响驱动，但高不确定性会触发类似人类规范性影响的机制转变，导致对公共信号的过度重视，这表明LLMs在不确定性条件下可能表现出与人类相似的启发式处理模式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both

The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of

Motivation: 传统地球系统模型在生成大量气候实现以量化极端气候风险时计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效准确的方法来预测极端事件统计。

Method: 采用预测-校正框架：预测步骤使用条件高斯模拟器，校正步骤使用非高斯机器学习模型。ML模型在参考数据和向参考数据调整的模拟场对上进行训练，确保对混沌的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在历史ERA5数据上验证准确，并在各种未来气候变化情景中展示外推能力。仅需单一变暖情景的一个实现进行训练，就能准确预测不同情景下的极端事件统计。

Conclusion: GEN2框架能够成功外推到训练数据分布之外，为高效准确的气候极端事件预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift框架成功实现了通过自然语言指令自动化托盘拾取操作，为户外环境中的自动化物料搬运提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

Motivation: 现有基准测试存在显著差距：高层语言指令跟随基准假设完美低级执行，而低级控制基准依赖简单单步命令，缺乏对任务规划和物理执行集成系统的综合评估。

Method: 基于Isaac Sim模拟器构建数字孪生厨房环境，包含500+复杂语言指令，支持移动机械臂机器人。提供基于视觉语言模型的任务规划策略和基于扩散策略的低级控制策略基线方法，以及轨迹收集系统。

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究的关键空白，实现了语言引导机器人代理更全面和现实的基准测试。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Conclusion: NeRD为解决关节刚体机器人通用神经模拟器学习问题提供了有效方案，在准确性、泛化性和实用性方面均优于现有方法，能够有效弥合模拟与现实的差距。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Motivation: 基于学习的灵巧操作方法存在策略空闲问题，即在某些状态下停止运动，这反映了训练数据的局限性。现有方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能对策略性能产生负面影响

Method: PIP方法在检测到的空闲状态施加扰动，帮助策略摆脱问题吸引域。该方法无需额外监督或训练，通过扰动促使策略探索更好的动作

Result: 在模拟双臂任务中显著改善测试性能，在真实世界插入任务中实现15-35%的绝对成功率提升，特别是在需要复杂多指操作的任务中表现优异

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，能够利用空闲状态检测来指导探索和策略优化，在灵巧操作任务中展现出良好的性能提升

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事（如漫画）需要结构化表示来捕捉事件、角色及其关系，但符号化叙事图谱存在不一致性和冗余问题，限制了推理和泛化的效果。

Method: 基于认知基础的叙事理解模型，使用词汇相似性和嵌入聚类方法来整合语义相关的动作和事件，对面板级、事件级和故事级图谱进行规范化处理。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上的初步评估显示，语义规范化在动作检索、角色定位和事件摘要等叙事推理任务中提高了连贯性和鲁棒性，同时保持了符号透明度。

Conclusion: 语义规范化是构建可扩展、认知启发的多模态叙事理解图谱模型的关键步骤。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络在CERN HL-LHC的喷注标记任务中表现出色，但其计算复杂度和不规则内存访问模式难以满足FPGA硬件触发系统的严格延迟和资源约束要求。

Method: 提出JEDI-linear架构，通过共享变换和全局聚合消除显式成对交互；采用细粒度量化感知训练和逐参数位宽优化；使用分布式算术实现无乘法器的乘累加操作。

Result: FPGA实现显示：延迟降低3.7-11.5倍，启动间隔降低高达150倍，LUT使用降低高达6.2倍，同时模型精度更高，完全无需DSP模块（对比方案需要8700+个DSP），首次实现低于60ns延迟。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了下一代触发系统的发展，实现了在实时环境中准确、可扩展且资源高效的GNN推理，开源模板将支持科学应用的复现和广泛采用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种结合视盘结构特征和视野功能参数的机器学习方法，用于分类原发性闭角型青光眼的快速和缓慢进展者，随机森林模型表现最佳（AUC=0.87）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原发性闭角型青光眼（PACG）的进展速度存在显著差异，需要准确识别快速进展者以进行及时干预。传统方法可能无法充分利用结构和功能数据的协同信息。

Method: 纳入451只眼，使用AI分割OCT提取31个视盘参数，结合五个视野区域的敏感性数据，训练多种机器学习分类器，并通过SHAP分析识别关键预测因子。

Result: 随机森林模型结合结构和功能特征表现最佳（AUC=0.87），显著优于仅使用结构（AUC=0.82）或功能（AUC=0.78）特征的模型。识别出6个关键预测因子，主要是下方视盘相关参数。

Conclusion: 结合视盘结构和视野功能参数能显著改善PACG进展风险的分类准确性，下方视盘形态学特征在监测疾病进展中具有关键作用。

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法存在质量有限、计算需求高、非专家使用复杂等问题，且评估策略往往不能直接反映统计效用。需要验证合成数据是否能可靠复现流行病学研究的关键发现。

Method: 使用对抗性随机森林(ARF)生成合成数据，复现6项流行病学研究的统计分析，比较原始结果与合成结果。评估维度性和变量复杂性对合成质量的影响。

Result: 所有复现研究的合成数据结果与原始发现一致。即使在样本量-维度比较低的数据集上，各种描述性和推断性分析的结果也高度匹配。降低维度和预推导变量进一步提高了结果质量和稳定性。

Conclusion: ARF是一种高效便捷的流行病学表格数据合成方法，能够可靠复现关键研究发现，降低维度和预处理变量可进一步提升合成数据质量。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Motivation: mRNA治疗和合成生物学的发展需要能够捕捉同义密码子使用潜在结构的模型，现有方法未能充分建模遗传密码固有的对称性关系。

Method: 引入等变mRNA语言模型，将同义密码子对称性编码为SO(2)循环子群，结合群论先验、等变损失和对称感知池化。

Result: 在下游属性预测任务中准确率提升约10%，序列生成中真实度提高4倍，功能属性保持能力提升28%，学习到的分布重现了已知的GC含量偏好和tRNA丰度模式。

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA建立了基于生物学原理的mRNA建模新范式，对下一代治疗药物设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional

video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，虚拟DES图像的F1分数为85.59%，真实DES图像为90.35%。虚拟图像虽略逊于真实图像，但仍显示出良好的分类性能。

Conclusion: 虚拟DES图像生成具有显著潜力，未来技术进步可能进一步缩小性能差距，使其在临床上可行，从而减少患者辐射暴露。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

TL;DR: 本研究探索GAN基于超分辨率技术在4D Flow MRI中的应用，通过比较三种对抗损失函数，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和近壁速度恢复方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中遇到低空间分辨率和噪声问题，特别是近壁速度测量。GAN在非医疗超分辨率任务中显示出优异的边界恢复能力，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用仍未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管计算模型进行训练和验证，通过MR-true重建管线转换为合成图像。实现专门的GAN架构，并评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein。

Result: Wasserstein GAN在近壁速度恢复方面表现最佳（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs 非对抗参考9.6%），而Vanilla和Relativistic GAN不如生成器单独训练（分别为8.1%和7.8% vs 7.2%）。在低SNR条件下，Wasserstein GAN仍显著优于基线方法（8.7% vs 10.7%）。

Conclusion: GAN基于超分辨率技术在4D Flow MRI中具有潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域。然而，对抗策略的谨慎选择对于网络训练的稳定性和性能至关重要。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种在医学影像标注中引入放射科医生像素级置信度的方法，通过训练时使用高置信度阈值（60%）的二值化标签，显著提升了肺超声分割性能，并改善了临床下游任务的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中放射科医生之间的标注差异导致标签不确定性，特别是在肺超声等主观性强的模态中。传统方法将标注视为绝对真值，忽略了临床数据中固有的随机不确定性。

Method: 设计数据标注协议，让放射科医生为每个标注区域提供像素级置信度值。比较多种将不确定性暴露给学习模型的方法，发现使用60%置信度阈值进行二值化标签训练的效果最佳。

Result: 使用高置信度阈值训练显著提升了分割性能，更重要的是改善了临床关键下游任务的表现：S/F氧合比值估计、S/F比值变化分类和30天患者再入院预测。

Conclusion: 标签置信度是一个有价值的信号，当正确利用时，可以显著提高医学影像AI的可靠性和临床实用性，高置信度阈值训练比50%阈值方法效果更好。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态、不确定性感知的MRI采集框架，能够根据每个受试者的具体情况调整扫描时间，通过概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，并使用保形预测提供校准的置信区间，实现自动化的扫描终止。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI加速方法使用固定的加速因子，要么导致扫描时间过长，要么图像质量不足，无法满足特定临床需求。现有方法忽略了重建过程中的不确定性，无法为下游临床任务提供统计保证。

Method: 使用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过保形预测转换为校准的置信区间。系统迭代采样k空间，更新重建结果并评估置信区间，当不确定性达到用户预设精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝关节和心脏MRI数据集上的验证表明，该方法相比固定协议减少了扫描时间，同时为最终图像的精度提供了正式的统计保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了固定加速因子，实现了患者特异性的采集，在扫描效率和诊断置信度之间取得平衡，是迈向个性化和资源高效MRI的关键一步。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑磁共振血管成像(MRA)中血管的精确分割对神经外科手术至关重要，但目前缺乏公开的详细标注数据集，且现有方法(如Frangi滤波器)精度不足

Method: 提出HessNet半监督学习轻量神经网络，集成Hessian矩阵用于3D管状结构分割，模型仅含6000个参数，可在CPU上运行

Result: 在最小训练数据集上达到最先进的血管分割精度，基于IXI数据集创建了200张半手动标注的脑血管数据集，由3名专家在3名神经血管外科医生监督下完成标注

Conclusion: HessNet显著降低了神经网络训练资源需求，提供高精度血管分割，使专家能专注于最复杂的病例，创建的标注数据集已公开可用

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and

  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this

Motivation: 预训练语言模型在代码理解任务中虽然强大，但计算开销和推理延迟限制了其在大规模应用中的部署。知识蓄簍技术可以解决这些问题，但在代码理解领域的潜力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究涵盖了两种主流知识蓄簍方法（输出层和特征层），在8个学生模型和2个老师模型上进行实验，测试三个下游任务。实验设计包括不同域的预训练模型和不同规模的学生模型。

Result: 知识蓄簍在所有测试模型上都带来显著性能提升。代码特定预训练模型作为老师效果更好。最新的特征层蓄簍方法表现最优，学生模型仅需5%的参数量即可保持98%的老师性能。模型架构相似性并不必然导致更好的性能。

Conclusion: 知识蓄簍在代码理解任务中具有重要价值，能够在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算开销。研究为代码理解领域的模型压缩和加速提供了重要指导，并指明了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary

Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Conclusion: 该方法建立了'小训练大生成'的新范式，为研究热力学极限提供了显著计算优势，可推广到其他晶格连续场系统

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于4×4满秩矩阵能否表示为两个秩2矩阵Hadamard积的开放性问题，探索矩阵分解的代数约束条件。

Method: 在𝔽₂上进行穷举搜索分析20,160个满秩二元矩阵，通过符号枚举验证ℤ上的结果，使用现代机器学习技术分析矩阵结构和维度。

Result: 发现5,304个反例（26.3%），矩阵密度对可表达性具有95.7%的分类准确率，可表达矩阵位于约10维子流形中而非预期的24维参数空间。

Conclusion: Hadamard可分解性受到深刻的代数约束，表现为低维子流形结构，矩阵密度是强预测因子，揭示了矩阵分解的隐藏代数规律。

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

TL;DR: 该论文建立了SVM核函数与量子传播子（时间相关格林函数）之间的数学等价关系，并展示了常见SVM核函数通过算子逆理论自然对应格林函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SVM核函数与量子传播子之间的数学等价关系，这一关系此前未被充分研究，旨在通过这种等价性改进SVM在物理系统中的预测性能。

Method: 使用算子逆理论建立核函数与格林函数的对应关系，引入核多项式方法（KPM）设计符合格林函数的定制化核函数，并通过数值实验验证效果。

Result: 数值实验证实，使用与格林函数对应的正半定核函数能显著提高SVM模型在物理系统中的预测准确性。

Conclusion: SVM核函数与量子格林函数之间存在深刻的数学等价性，利用这种关系设计的核函数能有效提升SVM在物理应用中的性能，但需要注意某些核函数（如sigmoid核）可能不满足Mercer定理要求。

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

Motivation: 人工智能预计将成为6G网络全生命周期的基础能力，需要构建能够理解语义信息而非符号级精度的新型空口架构。

Method: 采用压缩技术提取源数据中的关键语义信息，结合适应机制使空口能够动态传输语义信息，适应不同任务、数据类型和信道条件。

Result: 提出了原生AI驱动的空口架构框架，并通过6G非地面网络中的语义通信案例进行了验证。

Conclusion: 原生AI是6G网络发展的关键方向，但仍面临诸多挑战，需要进一步研究语义通信、自适应机制等技术问题。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

Motivation: 研究集成感知、通信和计算的空中联邦边缘学习系统，解决无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对机器学习模型训练收敛性能的影响问题。

Method: 采用空中计算技术进行一次性模型聚合，分析损失函数退化收敛行为，设计ISCC参数优化算法，交替优化批量大小控制和网络资源分配。

Result: 理论分析表明感知、通信和计算竞争网络资源共同决定收敛速率，提出的ISCC算法能有效协调批量大小控制和资源分配，提升学习性能。

Conclusion: 对于每个设备，当获得更大批量数据样本时应消耗更少的感知功率，反之亦然；在给定批量大小下，最优计算速度是满足延迟约束的最小值，所提算法能有效增强学习性能。

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Motivation: 探索人类大脑能够进行符号推理而大多数动物不能的原因，寻找动态绑定之外的符号思维必要条件。

Method: 设计了17个通用模拟实验，测试具有和不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在各种任务中的表现。

Result: 实验结果支持假设：动态绑定加上多位置谓词和结构映射是基本符号思维的最小必要条件。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于理解人类大脑如何产生符号思维，揭示了生物智能与机器学习方法的差异，并对生物启发的人工智能具有重要意义。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

Motivation: 军事车辆移动环境中的噪声会降低枪声检测系统的性能，需要一种轻量化的降噪解决方案

Method: 采用两层隐藏层的感知器神经网络结合信号处理技术，而非计算量大的卷积神经网络

Result: 在噪声与枪口冲击波峰值幅度相当时，检测率提高了一倍以上

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络架构能有效提升移动军事环境中枪声检测系统的性能

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

Motivation: 现有的LM-based TTS系统容易产生偏离输入文本的幻觉语音，而现有的缓解策略要么需要大量训练资源，要么会显著增加推理延迟。

Method: 首先进行不确定性分析，发现幻觉与模型不确定性呈强正相关；然后将TTS生成重新表述为轨迹流优化问题，引入增强的子轨迹平衡目标和锐化的内部奖励作为目标分布；还整合了奖励温度衰减和学习率优化来保证稳定性和性能平衡。

Conclusion: GOAT框架成功解决了LM-based TTS系统的幻觉问题，在不需要大量额外资源的情况下显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

### [308] [Privacy Preserving Inference of Personalized Content for Out of Matrix Users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14905)
*Michael Sun,Tai Vu,Andrew Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DeepNaniNet是一个深度神经网络推荐框架，通过图架构和BERT文本嵌入解决小众动态社区的冷启动和数据稀疏问题，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小众动态社区的推荐系统面临数据稀疏、冷启动用户/物品和隐私约束等挑战，传统协同过滤和基于内容的方法在这些场景下表现不佳。

Method: 采用归纳式图架构，结合用户-物品交互、物品-物品关系和BERT生成的文本评论嵌入，使用"内容篮子"用户表示和基于自编码器的泛化策略处理未见用户。

Result: 在CiteULike基准测试中取得SOTA冷启动结果，在AnimeULike数据集上比WMF和DropoutNet在Recall@100指标上分别提升7倍和1.5倍，且不降低矩阵外用户的性能。

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet能够在数据稀疏、冷启动严重的环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，并有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合量子Hopfield联想记忆和深度神经网络的混合推荐系统，在MovieLens 1M数据集上实现了优异的性能表现，并在噪声环境下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算在机器学习和推荐系统领域展现出巨大潜力，量子机器学习为数据处理和模式识别提供了强大新工具。本文旨在开发一种混合推荐系统，结合量子计算和深度学习的优势。

Method: 使用K-Means算法将用户原型聚类为多个独特组，通过编码器激活函数转换为极性模式，然后集成到基于变分QHAM的混合推荐模型中。在理想和噪声环境下分别训练35个epoch。

Result: 理想环境下：ROC值0.9795，准确率0.8841，F-1分数0.8786；噪声环境下：ROC值0.9177，准确率0.8013，F-1分数0.7866。同时优化了先前QHAM架构的量子比特开销。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个结合变分量子计算和深度学习的新框架，能够处理现实世界数据集，在噪声配置下表现稳定，为推荐系统的未来发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP是一种新型黑盒攻击框架，利用大语言模型的上下文学习能力生成高排名对抗性文档，无需梯度访问或模型内部操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经排序模型虽然高效但易受对抗性操纵，现有方法依赖token级扰动或手动重写，需要更高效、隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 通过少样本提示生成对抗性文档，使用FSAP-IntraQ（同查询有害样本）和FSAP-InterQ（跨查询迁移）两种模式，利用LLM的上下文学习能力。

Result: 在TREC 2020和2021健康 misinformation 数据集上，FSAP生成的文档在四个神经排序模型中 consistently 超越真实准确文档的排名，具有强立场对齐和低检测性。

Conclusion: FSAP构成了对神经检索系统的现实且可扩展的威胁，能有效泛化到专有和开源LLM，展示了黑盒攻击的严重风险。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了COSETTE对比标记化方法和MARIUS轻量级生成模型，解决了生成式推荐系统中缺乏协同信号和编码器-解码器架构效率低下的问题，显著缩小了与ID基模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统在实践中往往表现不如调优良好的ID基模型（如SASRec），主要存在两个关键限制：项目标记化中缺乏协同信号，以及编码器-解码器架构的效率低下问题。

Method: 1. COSETTE：对比标记化方法，将协同信息直接整合到学习到的项目表示中，联合优化内容重建和推荐相关性；2. MARIUS：轻量级音频启发式生成模型，将时间线建模与项目解码解耦。

Result: 在标准序列推荐基准测试中，该方法缩小甚至消除了生成式模型与现代ID基模型之间的性能差距，同时保留了生成式范式的优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入协同感知的标记化和高效的生成架构，成功解决了生成式推荐系统的关键限制，为生成式推荐系统的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

*Bahar Boroomand,James R. Wright*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出基于效用函数的推荐系统框架，通过成对比较学习用户偏好，采用主动采样策略优化推荐结果质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖数值评分或完整排序，但评分存在行为偏差且主观，完整排序不实用。需要更准确、高效的用户偏好学习方法

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce概率模型的成对比较框架，模型无关的效用函数优化，主动采样策略选择最有价值的查询

Result: 在两个实验中（电影推荐和大学招生场景）证明框架能提供更准确、数据高效且以用户为中心的个性化排序

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统方法的局限性，为推荐系统提供了更灵活、实用的偏好学习范式

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 首次系统研究GPU上基于图的近似最近邻搜索(ANNS)的图重排序效果，通过统一评估框架分析不同重排序策略，在保持搜索精度的同时实现高达15%的QPS提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的ANNS已成为现代AI应用的主导范式，但现有方法专注于算法创新而忽视了内存布局对执行时间的显著影响。

Method: 开发统一评估框架，包括图适配器(将任意图拓扑转换为通用表示)和GPU优化的图遍历引擎，引入量化结构属性与内存布局有效性关系的分析指标。

Result: 在多样化数据集和最先进图索引上的综合分析显示，GPU定向重排序在保持搜索精度的同时实现了高达15%的QPS改进。

Conclusion: 内存布局优化与现有算法创新正交，是提升图ANNS性能的重要方向，所有代码将在发表时开源以促进可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出M-LLM³REC框架，利用大语言模型从有限用户交互中提取深度动机信号，解决推荐系统中的冷启动和数据稀疏问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法在冷启动和稀疏数据场景下表现不佳，现有解决方案要么生成伪交互序列引入噪声，要么过度依赖语义相似性而忽略用户动机的动态变化

Method: 提出三模块框架：动机导向配置文件提取器(MOPE)、动机导向特征编码器(MOTE)和动机对齐推荐器(MAR)，通过动机驱动的语义建模实现个性化推荐

Result: M-LLM³REC在冷启动情况下相比最先进框架表现出更强的性能，提供鲁棒、个性化和可泛化的推荐

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度动机信号提取有效解决了推荐系统中的冷启动和稀疏数据挑战，为个性化推荐提供了新思路

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

TL;DR: 本论文结构化概述了基于反馈的高级检索和排名机制，将检索从静态组件转化为动态可学习的RAG系统部分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架将检索和推理视为孤立组件，在复杂任务上表现受限，需要迭代性证据收集和高精度检索

Method: 通过对比分析不同源头的反馈信号，按其在改善查询、检索上下文或文档库方面的作用进行分类

Result: 结合了信息检索和自然语言处理领域的最新迭代检索方法，提供了一个结构化的视角来理解动态RAG系统

Conclusion: 该综述有助于渗透IR和NLP视角，将检索重新定义为给完整RAG系统提供动态可学习能力的核心组件

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出MMQ框架，通过多模态混合量化解决语义ID在推荐系统中的模态平衡和行为对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ItemID方法在大规模动态物品库和稀疏长尾数据上表现不佳，语义ID虽能改善但面临跨模态协同与模态特异性平衡、语义-行为差距两大挑战

Method: 两阶段框架：1)共享-特定分词器使用多专家架构和正交正则化捕获多模态信息；2)行为感知微调通过多模态重构损失动态适应推荐目标

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试表明MMQ有效统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应性

Conclusion: MMQ为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了可扩展的通用解决方案

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.
