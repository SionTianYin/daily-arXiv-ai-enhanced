### [1] [Rethinking Graph-Based Document Classification: Learning Data-Driven Structures Beyond Heuristic Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00864)
*Margarita Bugueño,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种数据驱动的图结构学习方法，用于文档分类，无需人工设计，减少领域依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图文档表示多依赖启发式或领域知识，缺乏自动学习能力。

Method: 构建同质加权图，节点为句子，边通过自注意力模型学习，并采用统计过滤策略优化图质量。

Result: 在三个数据集上，学习到的图结构优于启发式方法，准确率和F1分数更高。

Conclusion: 自动图生成方法优于传统启发式方法，为NLP应用开辟新方向。

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

### [2] [FECT: Factuality Evaluation of Interpretive AI-Generated Claims in Contact Center Conversation Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00889)
*Hagyeong Shin,Binoy Robin Dalal,Iwona Bialynicka-Birula,Navjot Matharu,Ryan Muir,Xingwei Yang,Samuel W. K. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为3D（分解、解耦、脱离）的范式，用于评估大型语言模型在联系中心对话中生成的事实性，并引入了FECT基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在商业决策中，大型语言模型的幻觉问题可能导致严重后果，尤其是在联系中心对话分析中缺乏事实性评估标准。

Method: 通过3D范式（分解、解耦、脱离）设计人类标注指南和LLM-judges提示，并构建FECT数据集。

Result: 研究发现3D范式能够有效对齐LLM-judges，提供了一种自动评估AI生成内容事实性的新方法。

Conclusion: 论文为联系中心对话分析中的事实性评估提供了新的方法和工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

### [3] [XAutoLM: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models via Meta-Learning and AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00924)
*Ernesto L. Estevanell-Valladares,Suilan Estevez-Velarde,Yoan Gutiérrez,Andrés Montoyo,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XAutoLM是一个基于元学习的AutoML框架，通过复用历史经验优化语言模型微调，显著提升效率并减少资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化框架未能同时解决模型选择和超参数优化问题，导致语言模型微调资源消耗大。

Method: XAutoLM利用任务和系统级元特征，从历史成功和失败中学习，优化配置采样。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，XAutoLM性能优于零样本优化器，减少评估时间和错误率，并发现更多高效管道。

Conclusion: XAutoLM为资源高效的NLP模型微调提供了有效解决方案，推动了绿色AI的发展。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

### [4] [MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01005)
*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Lingyong Yan,Shuaiqiang Wang,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应RAG框架MAO-ARAG，通过多智能体协调动态规划工作流，以平衡性能和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定RAG管道在不同查询中难以平衡性能和成本的问题。

Method: 采用多智能体协调框架，包括执行器智能体和规划智能体，通过强化学习优化工作流。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上验证，MAO-ARAG能提供高质量答案并控制成本和延迟。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过动态规划工作流，显著提升了RAG系统的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

### [5] [UrBLiMP: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Linguistic Competence of Large Language Models in Urdu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01006)
*Farah Adeeba,Brian Dillon,Hassan Sajjad,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了UrBLiMP基准测试，用于评估多语言大模型在低资源语言乌尔都语中的语法知识，发现模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中数据不足，需评估其语法知识。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP数据集，包含5,696对最小差异句子，评估20个多语言大模型。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳（94.73%），但与其他顶级模型（如Gemma-3-27B-PT）无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言的细粒度语法知识捕捉上既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Cross-Domain Web Information Extraction at Pinterest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01096)
*Michael Farag,Patrick Halina,Andrey Zaytsev,Alekhya Munagala,Imtihan Ahmed,Junhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pinterest提出了一种高效、低成本的结构化数据提取系统，通过结合网页的结构、视觉和文本信息，使用简单模型（如XGBoost）实现了比复杂模型（如GPT）更高的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上的非结构化信息难以转化为结构化数据，Pinterest需要从电商网站准确提取产品属性以提升用户体验和内容分发效率。

Method: 采用新颖的网页表示方法，结合结构、视觉和文本模态，优化为小型模型学习，利用XGBoost等简单模型进行属性提取。

Result: 系统处理速度超过每秒1000个URL，准确性优于复杂模型（如GPT），成本仅为最便宜GPT替代方案的千分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和成本效益上显著优于复杂模型，展示了高效、可扩展的结构化数据提取解决方案。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成结构化临床咨询模板的能力，发现模型在全面性上表现良好，但模板过长且无法在长度限制下正确优先处理临床重要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在电子咨询中生成结构化临床模板的潜力，以提升医生间的信息交流效率。

Method: 使用145个专家制作的模板，通过多代理流程（包括提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型如o3在全面性上表现优异（达92.2%），但模板过长且优先级处理不佳，尤其在叙事驱动领域（如精神病学）表现下降。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交换，但需更强大的评估方法以优化其在真实医生沟通中的优先级处理能力。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

### [8] [CSIRO-LT at SemEval-2025 Task 11: Adapting LLMs for Emotion Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01161)
*Jiyu Chen,Necva Bölücü,Sarvnaz Karimi,Diego Mollá,Cécile L. Paris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了跨语言情感检测的挑战，提出通过微调多语言LLM（LoRA设置）来优化情感识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因文化和语言差异导致的情感表达多样性问题，提升跨语言情感识别的准确性。

Method: 采用任务适应策略，对预训练的多语言LLM进行LoRA设置的微调，针对每种语言单独优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感识别任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过语言特定的微调策略，可以有效提升跨语言情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

### [9] [Adaptive Content Restriction for Large Language Models via Suffix Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01198)
*Yige Li,Peihai Jiang,Jun Sun,Peng Shu,Tianming Liu,Zhen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法（Suffix Optimization, SOP），用于动态限制大语言模型（LLMs）生成特定受限内容，无需微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调）在适应不同用户群体和快速变化的限制需求时效率低下，计算和存储成本高。

Method: 提出Suffix Optimization（SOP），通过在提示后添加优化的短后缀，阻止LLMs生成受限内容，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在CoReBench基准测试中，SOP平均限制率比基线方法高6%-17%，并在实际平台POE上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SOP是一种高效、实用的轻量级方法，适用于动态内容限制需求。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

### [10] [Show or Tell? Modeling the evolution of request-making in Human-LLM conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01213)
*Shengqi Zhu,Jeffrey M. Rzeszotarski,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务，将聊天查询分割为请求内容、角色、查询特定上下文和附加表达，并分析了LLM用户行为与人类互动的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM用户行为的模式，揭示用户查询的多样性及其与人类互动的不同。

Method: 提出分割聊天查询的任务，并通过数据资源进行历时分析。

Result: 发现查询模式随用户经验变化，模型能力对用户行为有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLM用户行为具有独特性，模型更新可追踪社区层面的行为变化。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

### [11] [WebDS: An End-to-End Benchmark for Web-based Data Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01222)
*Ethan Hsu,Hong Meng Yam,Ines Bouissou,Aaron Murali John,Raj Thota,Josh Koe,Vivek Sarath Putta,G K Dharesan,Alexander Spangher,Shikhar Murty,Tenghao Huang,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDS是一个新的端到端基于网络的数据科学基准测试，包含870个任务，覆盖29个网站，旨在评估复杂、多步骤的数据科学工作流。现有LLM代理在WebDS上的表现远低于其他简单任务基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简化或局限于静态数据集，无法反映真实世界中数据科学的复杂性和多样性。

Method: 引入WebDS基准，包含多步骤、多模态的数据科学任务，评估代理在真实网络环境中的表现。

Result: 当前SOTA LLM代理在WebDS上表现不佳，仅完成15%的任务，暴露出信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用的LLM数据科学工具提供了更真实的测试平台，推动了该领域的进步。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WarriorMath是一个缺陷感知的数学问题解决框架，通过多专家协作生成高质量训练数据，并结合渐进式训练提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视LLM的特定失败模式，导致合成问题对性能提升有限。

Method: 采用多专家LLM协作生成、批评和改进问题，结合渐进式训练框架。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均性能提升12.57%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知的多专家框架能有效提升LLM的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

TL;DR: 论文分析了2025年XAI挑战赛，这是一个以黑客松形式举办的竞赛，旨在结合轻量级大语言模型（LLM）或混合LLM-符号系统，构建透明且可解释的教育问答系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在教育中的深入应用，透明性和可解释性需求日益增长。现有黑客松活动较少直接关注真实教育场景中的可解释AI（XAI）。

Method: 竞赛要求参与者构建基于逻辑模板的问答系统，使用轻量级LLM或混合系统，并生成自然语言解释。数据集通过Z3验证和专家学生评审优化。

Result: 竞赛展示了结合LLM与符号推理以实现可解释性的新方法，为未来XAI教育系统和研究提供了实践见解。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛是连接LLM与符号推理以提升可解释性的创新尝试，为教育领域的XAI发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research

### [14] [Prompting Large Language Models with Partial Knowledge for Answering Questions with Unseen Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01290)
*Zhichao Yan,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yanyan Wang,Hongye Tan,Jiye Liang,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角：通过部分相关知识唤醒LLMs的能力，并验证了其在知识图谱问答任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在利用部分相关知识时面临挑战，尤其是在知识库不完整的情况下。论文探讨了LLMs如何通过部分相关知识被唤醒。

Method: 通过构造部分相关知识（移除包含答案的路径）并分析LLMs的唤醒效应，实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Result: 在知识图谱问答任务中，基于唤醒的方法优于传统依赖嵌入相似性的方法，减少了噪声信息的干扰。

Conclusion: 部分相关知识可以唤醒LLMs的能力，为实际应用中的知识库不完整问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KEDAS提出了一种知识编辑对齐方法，通过多样增强和自适应推理提升LLMs的知识编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法依赖参数级编辑或检索方法，效果有限，KEDAS旨在更高效地对齐LLMs与知识编辑。

Method: KEDAS采用低秩适应学习上下文编辑知识，设计多样编辑增强技术提升召回率，并引入自适应推理机制动态选择路径。

Result: 在36个案例中的35个中表现最佳，编辑成功率、局部性和可移植性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KEDAS展示了知识编辑对齐的理想范式，兼具鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

Method: 结合文档处理、分段、CoT推理和结构化导出，生成QA-CoT数据集，并通过多维度控制机制增强多样性和相关性。

Result: 在SQuADShifts和Covid-QA测试集上，D-SCoRE生成的QA数据集表现优于人工标注数据集。

Conclusion: D-SCoRE高效、可扩展，适用于跨领域的高性能QA生成和微调。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练数据稀缺且多样性不足的问题。

Method: 通过知识图谱提取知识节点，结合路径采样和扩散合成技术生成多样化QA数据。

Result: 合成的LinkQA数据集使Llama-3 8B在MMLU和CMMLU上平均提升11.51%。

Conclusion: LinkSyn能有效提升模型性能，适用于不同规模和初始FLOPs的模型。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BoostQA的大规模QA数据集合成方法，解决了传统数据稀缺和多样性不足的问题，显著提升了LLM在跨领域和高难度任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量、知识密集的训练数据稀缺，传统语料库信息有限，且现有QA数据在可扩展性和知识多样性方面存在挑战。

Method: 设计了一种多样化合成管道，包括种子数据筛选、STEM多级合成、高难度合成和答案优化，并用于中阶段训练。

Result: Llama-3 8B模型在40B-token数据集上中训练后，MMLU和CMMLU平均提升12.74%，并在12个基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: BoostQA方法有效提升了数据质量和模型性能，展示了良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

Conclusion: 该框架为自动生成经济实惠的市场洞察提供了重要步骤。

Abstract: We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation.
At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖预定义的身份-概念关联，难以发现新的偏见形式，BADF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BADF通过系统化方法从LLM开放生成内容中提取身份与概念的关联，覆盖多模型和真实场景。

Result: BADF能全面映射和分析身份与概念的关联，揭示了开放生成中的偏见模式。

Conclusion: BADF为LLM偏见分析提供了可扩展工具，增进了对开放生成偏见的理解。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

TL;DR: ORACLE框架通过结合知识图谱和LLMs的生成能力，解决了LLMs在多跳问答任务中的局限性，提升了逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中表现不佳，主要因为无法捕捉实体间的深层概念关系。

Method: ORACLE通过动态构建问题特定知识本体、转化为一阶逻辑推理链、分解查询为子问题三阶段实现。

Result: 在多个标准MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: ORACLE框架有效提升了逻辑推理的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤数据集，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。传统方法仅基于样本难度或梯度影响选择数据，但两者单独使用均存在局限性。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant（DIQ）策略，优先选择高难度-高梯度影响的样本，平衡复杂推理与优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%数据即可匹配全数据集性能，10%数据时优于基线方法。人类和LLM评估显示DIQ生成更符合专家实践的推理。

Conclusion: DIQ通过平衡难度和梯度影响，显著提升医学推理任务的效率和质量，优于传统数据选择方法。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: 结合结构信息的扩散模型在代码生成任务中具有潜力，语法引导的去噪是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Biomedical text mining and question-answering are essential yet highly
demanding tasks, particularly in the face of the exponential growth of
biomedical literature. In this work, we present our participation in the 13th
edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic
question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for
developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source
large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer
biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A
majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for
Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their
answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring
all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable
insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results
for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge,
our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place
for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two
shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.

Motivation: 泰卢固语在全球NLP和机器学习领域代表性不足，缺乏高质量标注资源。

Method: 收集泰卢固语文本，构建标注平台和协议，生成26,150个句子，并微调预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，使用标注理由训练模型可提高准确性、减少偏见，并使解释更符合人类推理。

Conclusion: TeSent为泰卢固语NLP任务提供了资源，并推动了模型解释性和公平性的研究。

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating
pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student
learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms
often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent
tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines
Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding
in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework
with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates
human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive
science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality
assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering
teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the
potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the
ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计提示复杂且耗时，自动提示优化成为研究热点，但现有方法多关注单一目标，忽略了效率与效果的权衡。

Method: 提出MOPrompt框架，利用多目标进化优化技术，同时优化提示的准确性和上下文大小，并绘制帕累托前沿。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt显著优于基线，Sabiazinho模型下相同准确率时减少31%的token长度。

Conclusion: MOPrompt为实际应用中LLM的部署提供了关键工具，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

Motivation: 现有方法将提示视为整体，忽略了其结构异质性，导致对抗鲁棒性评估不准确。

Method: 提出PromptAnatomy框架，将提示分解为功能组件，使用ComPerturb方法选择性扰动，并引入PPL过滤机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上，ComPerturb实现了最先进的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和受控扰动对LLM的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

TL;DR: OpenMed NER是一套开源、领域适应的Transformer模型，通过轻量级领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和参数高效的低秩适应（LoRA）技术，在12个生物医学NER基准测试中取得了10个新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多样化实体类型上实现高性能且计算效率高的生物医学命名实体识别（NER）的挑战。

Method: 结合DAPT和LoRA技术，使用DeBERTa-v3、PubMedBERT和BioELECTRA作为基础模型，在350k语料库上进行轻量级预训练，并通过LoRA进行任务特定微调。

Result: 在12个生物医学NER基准测试中，10个实现了新的最先进性能，特别是在疾病和化学实体上表现突出。

Conclusion: OpenMed NER展示了开源模型通过策略性适应可以超越闭源解决方案，同时具有高效和低碳排放的特点。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本与人类写作的区分难度增加，传统的单语言AA方法已无法满足多语言场景的需求，因此需要研究多语言AA问题。

Method: 研究聚焦18种语言和8种生成器，评估单语言AA方法的多语言适用性和跨语言迁移能力。

Result: 研究发现某些单语言AA方法可适应多语言环境，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 多语言AA问题复杂，需开发更鲁棒的方法以匹配现实场景。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好是动态且依赖于上下文的，而现有LLMs假设用户偏好是静态的，无法有效适应动态需求。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，包含756个用户与LLM交互的历史会话，评估LLMs在新请求中推断和应用偏好的能力。

Result: 评估10种LLMs，发现其在推断偏好和识别相关上下文方面表现较差（精确度<50%，召回率<65%）。

Conclusion: 需要提升LLMs的上下文个性化能力，CUPID可作为推动改进的资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Motivation: 现有PRM采用单向评估范式，无法利用全局上下文验证推理步骤的一致性，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出BiPRM，通过反向推理轨迹的提示修改实现右到左评估，无需额外参数或延迟。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM显著优于单向基线，最高提升31.9%的步骤奖励评估。

Conclusion: BiPRM高效、鲁棒且通用，为过程奖励建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Result: 实验表明，CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放领域和多跳问答任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架通过多代理协同和长链训练策略，显著提升了RAG中知识融合与生成能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Conclusion: IterChat有效解决了多轮对话数据标注的挑战，提升了偏好提取的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

Method: 引入Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT)，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间尺度表示。

Result: TDT在RAID基准上达到0.855 AUROC（比最佳基线提升7.1%），在对抗任务中表现稳健（HART Level 2提升14.1%）。

Conclusion: 非平稳性是AI生成文本的基本特征，保留时间动态对鲁棒检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式感知推理对可扩展知识图谱问答有益，支持可持续性领域的跨图谱推理决策。

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

Motivation: 现代仅解码器的LLM在生成文本时存在幻觉问题，阻碍了其在知识密集型任务中的应用。检索增强生成（RAG）虽提供解决方案，但其非参数性质限制了与LLM的深度交互。

Method: 使用预训练的可微分外部记忆（MLP）模仿检索器行为，将其与LLM解码器结合，形成新架构。

Result: 新架构在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%，推理速度更快，且在幻觉基准和记忆密集型任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少幻觉问题，提升性能，同时保持推理能力，未来将开源代码和模型。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Motivation: 网页代理需具备足够知识以进行认知推理，因此需明确其能力阶段和知识类型。

Result: Web-CogReasoner在未见任务中表现显著优于现有模型，尤其在结构化知识起决定性作用的任务中。

Conclusion: 通过系统化知识学习和认知推理框架，网页代理能力得到显著提升，Web-CogBench为评估提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然能力强，但常生成流畅但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要有效检测和缓解方法。

Method: 动态生成看似合理但包含细微事实错误的假设性陈述，评估模型对这些扰动的敏感性。

Result: 在TruthfulQA等数据集上表现优于基线方法，幻觉分数平均降低24.5%。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing是一种无需重新训练的有效方法，可实时集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

TL;DR: PunGPT2是首个完全开源的旁遮普语大语言模型套件，通过优化分词器和预训练目标，结合Pun-RAG和Pun-Instruct，显著提升了低资源语言的生成能力，并首次引入量子感知检索方法Quantum-RAG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言（如旁遮普语）在NLP领域长期被忽视，缺乏高质量的模型支持。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 训练PunGPT2模型，优化分词器和预训练目标；2. 开发Pun-RAG检索增强框架；3. 提出Quantum-RAG混合检索系统，结合稀疏和密集方法；4. 使用QLoRA进行参数高效的指令微调（Pun-Instruct）。

Result: 模型在困惑度、事实性和流畅性上显著优于多语言基线（如mBERT、mT5）。

Conclusion: 本文为低资源语言提供了可扩展的LLM解决方案，并首次将量子表示引入低资源语言生成。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs过度使用特定词汇的原因，尤其是人类反馈学习（LHF）对其词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，设计实验模拟LHF过程，分析参与者对包含特定词汇文本的偏好。

Result: 实验表明，LHF导致LLMs过度使用某些词汇，且不同人群（如LHF工作者与LLM用户）对词汇的期望存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LHF对词汇选择的影响，强调数据和流程透明在人工智能对齐研究中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要推理长视频帧序列的场景中表现不佳，限制了其在具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解视频轨迹为子任务段，采用上下文学习方法实现。

Result: ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线模型，减少幻觉并线性扩展时间复杂度。

Conclusion: ROVER通过局部化推理和全局上下文保留，显著提升了视频推理能力，适用于具身任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Motivation: 现有方法在处理长文档时，由于上下文依赖和嵌入模型容量限制，检索性能提升有限。

Method: 提出情境嵌入模型（SitEmb），通过训练范式改进嵌入表示，使其能更好地编码上下文信息。

Result: SitEmb模型在书情节检索数据集上显著优于现有模型，8B参数版本性能提升超过10%。

Conclusion: SitEmb通过改进嵌入表示和训练范式，有效解决了长文档检索中的上下文依赖问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 论文为语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了数据和工具，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表面感知，而忽略了模型在语音场景中的上下文和推理能力。

Method: SpeechR通过三个关键维度（事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断）和三种评估格式（选择题、生成式和声学特征）来评估模型。

Result: 评估11种最先进的LALMs发现，高转录准确性并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为评估口语推理能力提供了结构化基准，有助于更针对性地分析模型在多样化对话任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在推理任务中因记忆依赖导致的错误，尤其是CoT推理中的中间错误。

Method: 提出STIM框架，通过统计共现分析标记的记忆来源（局部、中程、远程）。

Result: 发现局部记忆是错误主因（67%错误标记），STIM可预测错误标记。

Conclusion: STIM为诊断和改进模型推理提供工具，适用于其他结构化任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

Conclusion: Marco-Voice在语音清晰度和情感丰富度方面表现优异，代表了表现力神经语音合成领域的重大进展。

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates
voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework.
The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly
expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully
preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts.
Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of
speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional
embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality
emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six
professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试依赖人工或固定模板，限制了时间敏感问答（TSQA）的可扩展和全面评估。

Method: 利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和功能依赖）系统构建TSQA对，并引入时间准确性指标评估时间引用的有效性。

Result: 实验表明TDBench能实现可扩展且全面的TSQA评估，减少人工依赖，并补充现有基于维基百科/Wikidata的评估方法。

Conclusion: TDBench为时间敏感问答提供了更可靠和全面的评估方法，支持应用特定数据和多跳问题生成。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut)，一种无需训练的框架，通过归因分析压缩提示模板，显著减少提示大小并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和成本增加，需高效压缩方法。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分段为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并剪枝低效部分。

Result: 实验显示，ProCut减少78%的提示大小，性能保持或提升（优于其他方法62%），压缩延迟降低50%。

Conclusion: ProCut是一种灵活、高效且与现有框架兼容的提示压缩方法。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

*Gustaf Ahdritz,Anat Kleiman*

TL;DR: 论文提出了SMeL测试，评估语言模型过滤不可信信息的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，甚至优秀模型也会频繁产生幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网中存在大量不可信内容，但语言模型是否具备人类研究者使用的简单启发式方法来应对这一问题尚不明确。

Method: 引入Synthetic Media Literacy Test（SMeL Test），测试语言模型在上下文中过滤不可信信息的能力，并对多种指令调优的LLM进行基准测试。

Result: 发现没有模型能一致信任更可靠的来源，推理能力与高分相关，但即使最佳API模型也有高达70%的幻觉率，且更大更强的模型未必表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型在过滤不可信信息方面的局限性，为未来开发新方法提供了指导。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Motivation: 理解LLMs中谄媚行为的内部机制，以改进模型的对齐性和真实性。

Method: 通过系统性研究用户意见对谄媚行为的影响，结合logit-lens分析和因果激活修补技术，分析模型内部机制。

Result: 发现谄媚行为源于深层表征的结构性覆盖，语法视角（第一人称vs第三人称）显著影响谄媚率。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为是深层表征的结构性问题，对AI对齐和真实性系统设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了青少年对毒性内容的独特感知，即成人认为无害但青少年认为有毒的语言。

Method: 以中国青少年为研究对象，构建首个中文‘青少年毒性’数据集，分析其特征，并测试现有毒性检测技术的准确性。

Result: 青少年对毒性的感知与上下文因素相关，结合元信息能提升检测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来青少年为中心的毒性检测提供了新见解。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

Motivation: 探索元学习是否能提升小型语言模型的预训练效率和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码语言模型预训练，构建四个LLama风格解码器模型（11M-570M参数）。

Result: 模型在相同损失下训练速度提升1.6倍，多语言通用NER任务F1分数提高，训练动态呈现两阶段变化（多样化与压缩）。

Conclusion: 元学习显著提升小型语言模型的效率和可解释性，训练动态特征可作为元适应的标志。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法有效评估LLMs的数学能力，尤其是证明中心问题，手动创建成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 提出Proof2X路线图，将数学证明转化为易于验证的问题，并设计了一种新型混合格式问题（$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions）。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest基准测试发现，现有LLMs在代数几何领域的理解存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架为深入研究AI系统的数学智能提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中文化信息的编码机制，以促进模型的公平性和包容性。

Method: 扩展了语言特异性神经元的定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（8520万标记，涵盖六种文化），通过定位和干预实验分离文化神经元。

Result: 发现文化信息由上层神经元编码，且可独立调控，不与语言或其他文化神经元重叠。

Conclusion: 文化知识在多语言模型中可选择性编辑，有助于提升公平性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Motivation: 理解强化学习中熵与性能交换的机制，以优化大语言模型的训练效果。

Method: 将训练过程分为熵上升和熵平稳两个阶段，分析不同粒度下的交换机制，并提出基于困惑度和位置信息的动态奖励调整方法。

Result: 在上升阶段，负样本的熵减少有助于学习有效推理模式；在平稳阶段，学习效率与高熵标记和序列末尾位置相关。提出的方法在多种大语言模型上优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号的方法能有效提升模型性能，揭示了熵与性能交换的关键机制。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界的语言景观中存在现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）与方言之间的显著差异，这对自然语言处理（尤其是机器翻译）提出了巨大挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专门模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2-base-1024架构，并在Nabra数据集上微调，使用MADAR语料库进行严格评估。

Result: MSA-to-Shami模型在GPT-4.1评估中获得了4.01/5.0的高分，表明其翻译既准确又方言地道。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为方言阿拉伯语翻译提供了高保真工具，对内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

Conclusion: Dynaword方法和Danish Dynaword为大规模开放数据集的发展提供了可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器是确保RAG系统响应相关性和安全性的关键组件。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整位置编码和引入多粒度注意力机制，显著提升大语言模型在长上下文输入中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在输入超出预训练上下文窗口时的性能下降问题，特别是由于RoPE的OOD行为导致的性能损失。

Method: 提出LaMPE，通过参数化缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码，并设计多粒度注意力机制以捕获局部和长程依赖关系。

Result: 在五个主流长上下文基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种RoPE基础的大语言模型，无需额外训练即可提升长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for
training large omni-modal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型参数增长带来的性能提升不成比例，且计算和存储开销大，现有方法在性能和效率上仍有挑战。

Method: 提出CAMERA框架，将MoE层视为微专家混合体，并开发了CAMERA-P（剪枝）和CAMERA-Q（量化）方法。

Result: CAMERA-P在20%-60%剪枝率下优于基线，CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下表现优异，分析57B参数模型仅需5分钟。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架有效解决了MoE模型的冗余问题，显著提升了计算和存储效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Motivation: 理解微调大语言模型在政治话题上如何影响其立场，并探索减少跨话题立场泛化的机制。

Method: 提出Political Neuron Localization through Activation Contrasting (PNLAC)定位两类政治神经元，并开发InhibitFT抑制性微调方法。

Result: 实验证明PNLAC定位的神经元类型具有鲁棒性，InhibitFT平均减少20%跨话题立场泛化，且仅需抑制5%神经元即可有效缓解问题。

Conclusion: 通过神经元定位和抑制性微调，可以有效减少政治微调带来的跨话题立场泛化问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于GQA的LLMs在KV缓存压缩中依赖启发式令牌淘汰，忽略了注意力头的功能差异，导致关键令牌被淘汰，影响模型性能。

Method: 首先识别能够检索关键令牌及其语义上下文的注意力头，利用这些头确定重要令牌并保留其KV缓存对；同时引入层自适应KV缓存分配策略。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，CompressKV在不同内存预算下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头选择和层自适应策略，显著提升了KV缓存压缩的效率和LLMs的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型仅适用于静态图谱，而动态知识图谱的持续演化需要解决‘灾难性遗忘’问题。

Method: BAKE利用贝叶斯后验更新原则作为连续学习策略，并结合连续聚类方法约束新旧知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯更新和聚类约束，有效解决了动态知识图谱中的知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定上下文代理，限制了研究的广泛性。LLM为解决这一问题提供了新途径。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过非结构化文本数据评估创新性，并在软件更新和用户反馈两个场景中测试其性能。

Result: LLM框架在F1分数和一致性上优于其他方法，展示了其可靠性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究和实践提供了高效、可靠的创新测量工具，并讨论了关键设计决策对性能的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类基准上，单次优化循环提升准确率约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt框架通用性强，仅需LLM黑盒访问和自动评估指标，适用于多领域任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层网络中心理语言学信号更易解码。

Conclusion: 语言身份影响LLMs的行为和内部表征，为跨语言认知模型应用提供新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs解决算术问题具有可解释的组合结构，数字位置电路在其中起关键作用。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

Motivation: 标准Transformer在处理技术文档的细粒度语法和实体关系时表现不佳，需要一种更高效且结构感知的模型。

Method: CGT通过动态图构建（序列、跳字和语义相似边）和GATv2Conv层学习局部结构，再通过Transformer编码全局依赖。

Result: CGT在RAG流程中表现优于GPT-2和BERT，准确率提升24.7%，参数量减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT通过结合结构和语义建模，适应技术语言需求，支持更好的实体跟踪和检索增强响应。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

*Motaz Saad,David Langlois,Kamel Smaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种从Wikipedia和EURONEWS构建多语言可比语料库的方法，并实验了基于双语词典和潜在语义索引（LSI）的跨语言相似度对齐方法，发现CL-LSI优于词典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可比语料库在多语言自然语言处理中很有用，尤其是在某些领域或语言缺乏平行文本时。

Method: 从Wikipedia和EURONEWS构建英语、法语和阿拉伯语的可比语料库，实验两种跨语言相似度对齐方法：基于双语词典和CL-LSI。

Result: 实验表明CL-LSI在跨语言文档对齐中优于词典方法，并能实现主题和事件级别的对齐。

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于主题和事件级别的对齐任务。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

### [89] [Automated SNOMED CT Concept Annotation in Clinical Text Using Bi-GRU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02556)
*Ali Noori,Pratik Devkota,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双向GRU的神经序列标注方法，用于自动标注临床文本中的SNOMED CT概念，性能优于传统规则系统，且计算成本低于基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化医学概念标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注耗时且难以扩展。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据子集，通过SpaCy和SciBERT预处理文本，并提取上下文、句法和形态特征。

Result: 模型在验证集上F1分数达到90%，优于传统规则系统，且能有效处理模糊术语和拼写错误。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 自动分析对话有助于理解和指导行为，特别是在心理咨询等以对话为主的领域。

Method: 定义神经网络模型，基于对话建模的最新成果，分类和预测治疗师与客户的行为代码。

Result: 模型在两项任务中均优于多个基线，并通过分析揭示了网络设计对治疗对话建模的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为实时指导心理治疗提供了有效工具，展示了神经网络在行为代码建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

TL;DR: Sparse-dLLM通过动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力优化dLLMs的计算和内存开销，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs在推理时存在高计算复杂度和内存开销，现有缓存技术无法满足长上下文需求。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存淘汰和延迟双向稀疏缓存，利用注意力模式选择性保留关键令牌。

Result: 实验显示Sparse-dLLM在LLaDA和Dream系列上吞吐量提升10倍，性能与内存开销与基线相当。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，适用于长上下文推理。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

Result: 课堂数据预训练提升模型性能，长上下文和说话者信息尤其有效。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了辅导对话建模的挑战，课堂数据预训练是有效策略。

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中记忆现象的多面性及其潜在机制。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）分析LLM的注意力权重，评估其与现有分类法的一致性。

Result: 现有分类法效果不佳，新分类法将记忆样本分为三类：基于语言建模能力猜测的、因训练集高重复性回忆的，以及非记忆样本。

Conclusion: 研究表明，少量样本的记忆并不对应独特的注意力机制，且许多可提取样本实际是模型猜测的，需单独研究。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多视角话语分析方法，结合领域特定的谈话动作、对话行为和话语关系，以解决数学教育中反馈分析的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决话语分析中的多功能性和领域特定分类遗漏问题，以提供更全面的教学反馈。

Method: 整合领域特定的谈话动作、对话行为（43标签）和话语关系（16关系），应用于两个数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无谈话动作的话语在课堂中具有关键功能，强调话语关系和对话行为对AI辅助教育系统的重要性。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于提升教育反馈和开发更有效的AI教育代理。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

TL;DR: EHSAN是一个数据驱动的混合流程，结合ChatGPT伪标签和人工审核，构建了首个可解释的阿拉伯语医疗领域方面级情感分析数据集。实验表明，即使仅使用ChatGPT生成的标签，模型性能下降有限，且减少方面类别显著提升了分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和缺乏方面级情感标签而难以自动化分析，EHSAN旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过ChatGPT伪标签和人工审核构建数据集，并训练两种Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍保持高准确率，减少方面类别显著提升分类效果。

Conclusion: EHSAN为阿拉伯语医疗领域方面级情感分析提供了可扩展且有效的方法，未来可扩展至其他医院并优化提示设计。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多LLM交互方法缺乏结构化，导致生成内容难以验证。MArgE旨在通过计算论证学提供可解释的论证路径。

Method: 使用Argumentative LLMs构建结构化论证树，为任务验证提供可解释的决策路径。

Result: MArgE在实验中显著优于单LLM和现有非结构化多LLM方法。

Conclusion: 结构化论证机制能有效提升多LLM输出的组合效果。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中潜力巨大，但受限于幻觉问题（如知识不足、视觉定位和推理能力不足），影响了精确诊断。现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段框架（知识检索、任务案例研究、结果验证）。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs在眼科诊断中的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究字符级任务对语言模型的挑战，尤其是子词单元（subword）对模型表现的影响。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种领先的开源和专有模型，分析单词和分词属性与模型表现的关系。

Result: 模型在字符级任务上表现较差，单词长度和字符计数对计数任务影响更大，而分词长度对位置理解任务有负面影响。

Conclusion: CharBench为未来研究提供了工具，有助于改进模型在字符级任务上的表现。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流奖励模型（RM）在偏好建模中存在token级交互不足的问题，导致其判断信号容易被上下文注意力分配错误所干扰。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，利用基于交互的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，通过注意力对齐目标指导学生模型模拟教师模型的交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏方法能够提供比现有RM优化方法更稳定和通用的奖励信号。

Conclusion: 注意力劫持是RM中更根本的局限性，交互蒸馏方法有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制在长序列建模中计算复杂度高（O(N^2)）的问题，同时避免预训练需求。

Method: 采用层间指针链机制，每层指针选择依赖于前一层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列上实现2-10倍加速，2048个token的复制任务中保持>95%准确率，并学习可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的高效长序列建模提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Conclusion: 建议数据集不应被视为不可变，需定期检查和版本化，同时为数据集创建者和使用者提供改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest
developments in the field, with a focus on deep learning techniques, especially
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and twin networks (Siamese networks),
which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face
recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include
changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research
trends such as developing more efficient algorithms and integrating multimedia
technologies to improve the performance of recognition systems in real-world
environments and expand their applications.

*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种新颖的图像数据集所有权验证方法，通过选择性修改少量困难样本嵌入可验证痕迹，有效验证所有权同时保持数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像AI模型的广泛应用，数据所有者需要可靠机制验证其专有数据是否被滥用，现有方法在验证效果与数据完整性之间存在权衡。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹，实现所有权验证。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和多种模型架构上的实验表明，HoneyImage在保持数据完整性的同时，实现了高验证准确率。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用机制，保护图像数据集所有权，促进安全共享和数据驱动AI的潜力发挥。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于扩散框架的单阶段生成方法，通过联合合成显微结构图像和分割掩码，提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金属合金显微结构分割中因缺乏人工标注掩码（尤其是稀有或复杂形态）导致的机器学习效果受限问题。

Method: 提出PF-DiffSeg，一种基于全局相分数控制的单阶段去噪扩散框架，联合生成图像和掩码，并通过增强少数类别的数据分布提升多样性。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法显著提升分割精度（尤其是少数类别），并优于两阶段掩码引导扩散和GAN基线，同时减少推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg将生成和条件整合为统一框架，为金相学应用提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的时间信息，TESPEC旨在填补这一空白，提升循环模型在事件感知任务中的表现。

Method: TESPEC采用掩码图像建模范式，设计新重建目标，将事件累积为伪灰度视频，要求模型推理事件长期历史。

Result: 实验证明TESPEC在目标检测、语义分割和单目深度估计等任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TESPEC通过有效利用事件数据的时空信息，显著提升了循环模型的性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Conclusion: 扩散增强在法医人脸识别中有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

Result: 在十个基准测试中，CCRA增强的LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型表现最优，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA通过一致性和渐进性设计，显著提升模型性能和注意力对齐。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Conclusion: ROVI为实例化文本到图像生成提供了高质量数据支持，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种可靠的方法，适用于稀疏3D重建，尤其在视觉结构化环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在消除版权标识的同时，显著优于九种现有规避攻击方法，且在泛化性和有效性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需要长期发展以提升其实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉性假设，忽略了训练中学习的小权重对特征的衰减作用。COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息。

Method: COSTARR结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，通过概率解释其评分，并进行消融实验验证预衰减和后衰减特征的作用。

Result: COSTARR在多种预训练架构（如ViTs、ConvNeXts、ResNet）上表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别的能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，处理透明图像时需两阶段流程（修复+抠图），导致透明度不一致和边缘锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持ControlNet可控编辑，可集成到多种社区模型中。引入LayerBench数据集及新的透明度边缘质量评估指标。

Result: 实验证明Trans-Adapter在透明图像修复中有效，解决了透明度和边缘质量问题。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效、可控的解决方案，并支持广泛集成。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: MASIV是一种基于视觉的材料无关系统识别框架，通过可学习的神经本构模型推断物体动力学，无需预定义材料先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力。

Method: MASIV采用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何指导。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: MASIV解决了材料无关系统识别的挑战，提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Result: EARL模型在多种编辑任务中表现优异，优于基线模型，且训练数据需求更低。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的前沿，并开源了代码和数据。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AR/VR体验、人机交互、辅助技术和适应性医疗解决方案，需要准确的第一人称运动预测和模拟。

Method: 提出UniEgoMotion，一种基于条件运动扩散模型的统一框架，利用头部中心运动表示和第一人称视觉输入。

Result: UniEgoMotion在运动重建和生成任务中表现优异，首次实现了从单张第一人称图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新标准，拓展了相关应用的可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，特别是在脑MRI异常检测中的应用。

Method: 整合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），工业数据集上表现同样出色。

Conclusion: 该方法在医学和工业领域均表现出色，具有鲁棒性和泛化能力，适合实际临床应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在性能和保真度之间存在权衡，且存在效率低下或语义失真的问题。颜色作为信息载体和语义单元的双重作用被忽视。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且通过FID结果验证了其高质量数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿提升了数据集压缩的效果，并首次利用预训练扩散模型优化压缩数据集。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇查询下存在离线流程僵化和3D对象级理解不精确的问题，OpenGS-Fusion旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合3D高斯表示与截断符号距离场，动态融合语义特征；引入多模态语言引导的自适应阈值方法（MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding）优化分割。

Result: 在3D mIoU上比固定阈值策略提升17%，在3D对象理解和场景重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在开放词汇场景理解和语言引导交互方面表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制过于统一，未能考虑用户个体差异（如年龄、心理健康等）。

Method: 提出PSA框架，集成用户个性化配置文件，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面表现更优，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA为个性化安全控制提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化需求上的不足。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型，结合语言控制分割策略（LS）和窗口控制细化策略（WR）。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在用户控制和分割精度方面表现优异，适合高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Motivation: 解决场景文本识别（STR）中因复杂视觉外观和有限语义先验带来的挑战。

Method: 通过将真实文本编码到嵌入空间并应用损失感知掩码，模拟课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，TEACH训练的模型实现了更高的准确率，尤其是在挑战性条件下。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，具有鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在大量轨迹处理时计算成本高，存在两个主要瓶颈：基于Transformer的迭代跟踪和相关性特征计算。

Method: 引入粗到细策略，从小点集开始跟踪并逐步扩展，使用可学习插值模块初始化新轨迹；优化相关性特征计算。

Result: 算法比现有方法快5-100倍，同时保持最优跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新方法高效解决了计算瓶颈，显著提升了3D点跟踪的速度和实用性。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Method: 采用共享特征提取骨干网络，同时预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化几何约束。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能区域定位和分类任务中均表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模功能区域定位和分类，提升了任务性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 3D占用定位任务和GroundingOcc模型为室外场景提供了更精确的对象感知。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco提出了一种无监督框架，通过专门为风格迁移任务学习的文本表示，解决了扩散模型在风格迁移中的语义局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格迁移中因将文本描述视为统一指导而忽略了语义与视觉风格的空间属性之间的差距，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 框架包括Prior-Guided Data Distillation（PGD）和Contrastive Semantic Decoupling（CSD），前者通过生成伪配对数据提取风格知识，后者通过域特定权重调整文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保存方面优于现有方法，并支持独特的去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格迁移中的语义问题，展示了其扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文信息增强楼层平面图定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习预训练房间判别器，显著提高了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面图定位因重复结构易导致模糊性，现有方法忽视视觉图像的丰富上下文信息，需利用场景布局先验消除不确定性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中。

Result: 在标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉场景上下文信息可有效消除FLoc中的模糊性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖两阶段流程，导致网格与目标图像不对齐，影响渲染质量和细节保留。

Method: 引入Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块和Latent Texture Attention机制，动态优化几何和纹理。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在网格初始化不准确和真实场景下仍能实现高保真重建和高质量新视角合成。

Conclusion: MoGaFace通过动态优化和一致性机制，显著提升了3D头部虚拟形象的渲染质量和细节表现。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Eigen Neural Network (ENN)的新架构，通过层共享的正交特征基重新参数化权重，解决了传统梯度优化中权重结构混乱的问题，提升了特征表示和泛化能力。ENN在图像分类和跨模态检索中表现优异，并支持高效的局部学习变体ENN-ℓ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络的梯度优化容易导致权重结构混乱，影响特征清晰度和学习动态。论文旨在通过新的架构设计解决这一根本性问题。

Method: 提出ENN架构，通过层共享的、学习的正交特征基重新参数化权重，强制权重动态去相关和对齐。此外，还开发了无需反向传播的局部学习变体ENN-ℓ。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。ENN-ℓ实现了2倍以上的训练加速，且精度超过端到端反向传播。

Conclusion: ENN通过直接解决反向传播的表示缺陷，提供了性能更强、训练更高效的架构范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Result: 在多个数据集上匹配或超越标准RevSNNs的准确性，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三个缓存优化原型构建和预测校准，提升零样本设置下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本假设，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，导致原型构建不紧凑。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，分别用于原型初始化、视觉与文本信息整合及预测校准。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++通过多缓存和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型在开放集场景中表现不佳，主要因为其隐含的类别完整性假设以及视图引起的静态偏差。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成具有校准模糊不确定性的虚拟样本，并引入辅助模糊感知网络和HSIC对比去偏模块。

Result: 在多种多视图基准测试中，该框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了良好的封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模糊校准和视图去偏，有效解决了多视图开放集学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像描述减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包含轻量级描述生成模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关描述并选择最佳描述。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的计算成本显著优于现有方法（如FLOPs减少6.5%，性能提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高剪枝率下的视觉信息损失问题，为LVLMs的高效应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Motivation: 解决3DGS在现实场景中因标签噪声（如移动物体、非朗伯表面和阴影）导致的重建错误问题，现有方法难以有效分离噪声或需场景特定调参。

Result: 实验表明，OCSplats在不同复杂度的场景中均实现了领先的重建性能和精确的噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats通过创新技术解决了3DGS中的噪声问题，无需调整参数即可适用于不同噪声比例的场景，具有广泛实用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Motivation: 生成模型（如GAN和扩散模型）生成的图像越来越逼真，现有检测器对未知模型泛化能力不足，尤其是语义内容相近时。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强泛化能力，为解决生成图像检测问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上，DisFaceRep显著优于现有弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: WSFP任务具有挑战性，但DisFaceRep通过解耦表示有效提升了性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与特定聚类任务需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超过基于更大ViT-L/14的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，有效提升了图像聚类的性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域存在明显的长尾分布问题，影响了重建质量。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支，分别通过动态对齐RGB特征和优先传播时间变化信息来解决长尾问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，STDNet在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet通过时空差异机制有效解决了长尾分布问题，提升了深度超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModelNet40-E是一个新的基准测试，用于评估点云分类模型在合成LiDAR噪声下的鲁棒性和校准性，提供噪声污染点云和点级不确定性标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对点云分类模型在噪声条件下的鲁棒性和校准性的评估，ModelNet40-E填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过高斯噪声参数（σ, μ）生成噪声污染点云，并评估PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3在分类准确性、校准指标和不确定性感知上的表现。

Result: 所有模型在噪声增加时性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更一致。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和校准性评估提供了新工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声条件下表现最佳。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGCap方法通过语义组解码和关键句子选择模块，显著提升了零样本视频字幕生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本视频字幕方法因忽略时间动态和视频级监督不足而表现不佳。

Method: 提出SGCap方法，包括语义组解码（SGD）、关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块。

Result: SGCap在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态和语义多样性，有效提升了零样本视频字幕生成的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像（T2I）模型生成不安全内容，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），而当前的防御方法依赖大规模数据集且静态防御，导致计算成本高、适应性差。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全替代文本，构建文本训练语料；优化通用软提示，结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: PromptSafe在多个基准测试中实现了最低的不安全生成率（2.36%），同时保持高良性保真度，并展现出强泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为T2I模型的安全部署提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无监督立体匹配框架，通过置信度估计和深度先验损失函数解决现有方法的模糊性问题，并在KITTI Stereo基准上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督立体匹配因无需昂贵标注而受关注，但现有方法受模糊性问题（如重复模式和无纹理区域）影响较大。

Method: 提出了一种包含置信度估计算法和两种深度先验损失函数的框架，通过局部一致性检查和准密集对应关系学习深度排序。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准上实现了无监督立体匹配方法中的最高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了3D几何知识，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大语言模型生成临床描述或固定长度提示，限制了信息的丰富性和领域特异性，导致视觉特征对齐不佳。

Result: 在肾癌和肺癌数据集上表现优于单提示基线，接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过生成更准确的临床描述和优化文本编码，显著提升了病理图像分类的效果。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在真实数据上泛化能力差，主要由于域差异（如颜色、光照、对比度和纹理）。

Method: 提出UgDA方法，通过扰动RGB空间的均值和标准差生成新域样本，并利用高斯分布建模扰动方向和强度的不确定性，同时强制原始与增强数据的特征一致性。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，可有效提升立体匹配模型的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Motivation: 现有3D异常检测方法通常针对特定类别训练，且无法适应新类别的出现，限制了其实际应用。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别为66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架在3D异常检测中表现出色，能够持续学习并适应新类别。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Result: 在BUSI基准和专有数据集上实现高分类准确率，生成临床相关显著性图，但解剖特异性和临床实用性仍有不足。

Conclusion: 需进一步开发上下文感知的可解释性方法和人机交互反馈，以满足临床需求。

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Conclusion: CSINet通过跨视图语义交互，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的微小目标问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型和统计颜色分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供了无需先验训练数据的高效红斑检测方法。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Motivation: 扩散模型的广泛使用导致个人艺术作品被未经授权使用，现有保护方法（如扰动、水印）效果有限。

Result: 实验表明，StyleSentinel在单样本验证任务中表现优于现有方法，并在在线平台上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，ViLaCo显著优于现有方法，检测和定位准确率均达到最优。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过视觉-语言协作有效弥补弱监督不足，为图像伪造定位提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在HADR中因数据类别不平衡、中度损坏样本稀缺及人工标注不准确而难以泛化，亟需改进。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）融合图像与人类知识，生成多样化的灾害损坏数据。

Result: 初步实验显示数据生成质量良好，提升了不同损坏程度场景的分类效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为HADR中的损坏评估提供了一种有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级自适应特征图大小的SoftMax注意力机制（FWA），并结合全局-局部特征融合机制和GhostNet，设计了轻量级混合主干网络LOLViT，在速度和精度上优于同级CNN模型。

Motivation: 解决卷积神经网络（CNNs）与注意力机制在计算效率上的不平衡问题，以及现有轻量级SoftMax注意力机制在长序列建模和计算饱和问题上的不足。

Method: 提出Fast Window Attention（FWA）机制，通过窗口聚合生成少量关键序列进行注意力计算，并设计全局-局部特征融合机制，结合GhostNet构建LOLViT网络。

Result: LOLViT在分类（ImageNet 1K）、检测（COCO 2017）和分割（BDD100K）任务中表现优异，推理速度是MobileViT-X的5倍。

Conclusion: LOLViT通过自适应特征图大小和全局-局部融合机制，显著提升了轻量级混合网络的性能，为视觉任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Motivation: 随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量数字地形图（DTMs）的需求日益增长，但传统方法需要大量手动预处理，效率低下。

Method: 采用神经体积渲染技术，仅需图像像素的位置信息，无需深度或其他结构先验，直接从卫星图像中学习地形图。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，结果显示地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法在生成高质量DTMs方面表现出潜力，为行星探索提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架为开放属性识别提供了解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以有效恢复因动态范围和线性响应而抑制的关键目标细节。

Method: 提出SFAE框架，将频率带“空间化”，开发跨域融合注意力模块，并进行自适应非线性调整。

Result: 通过结合空间和频率域特征，SFAE能够有效恢复RAW图像中被抑制的细节。

Conclusion: SFAE框架在RAW图像目标检测中表现出色，为多域特征融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Conclusion: ForenX通过MLLMs和专用数据集显著提升AI生成图像检测的解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

TL;DR: 3DRot是一种几何一致的图像增强方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新相关数据，提升3D任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵以及传统图像变换破坏几何一致性的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot，一种基于相机光学中心的旋转和镜像方法，同步更新RGB图像、相机参数、物体位姿和3D标注。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测的性能指标（IoU3D、ROT误差和mAP0.5）。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种即插即用的通用方法，适用于多种3D任务。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast
and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability,
interpretability, and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在已知生成器上表现良好，但对新兴或未知生成器的性能下降，因特征嵌入重叠导致跨生成器分类不准确。

Method: MiraGe通过最小化类内差异和最大化类间分离学习生成器不变特征，并结合多模态提示学习优化CLIP模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MiraGe实现了最先进的性能，即使对未知生成器（如Sora）也保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器不变特征和多模态学习，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: 渐进式训练方法使小模型在视频推理任务中表现优异且计算高效。

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其是处理复杂视频内容时。

Method: 提出E-VRAG框架，包括帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布检索策略和多视角问答方案。

Result: 在四个公开基准测试中，E-VRAG计算成本降低约70%，且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Result: 剪枝92.6%视觉标记，保持自由形式VQA任务基线性能；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Method: 采用两阶段LLM辅助进化算法优化特征选择和logits计算，结合低精度代码转换和网络执行提升效率。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类中，EvoVLMA找到的算法比经典APE方法准确率提升1.91点。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型适应算法的自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗问题。

Method: 使用轻量级预测网络和历史上下文生成ROI，通过Gumbel-Softmax采样生成掩码，指导自适应扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，能耗降低65%以上，检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 自适应扫描框架有效解决了LiDAR的能耗问题，同时保持了检测性能。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据可撤回，需从模型中完全消除其影响，而ViTs的随机数据遗忘问题尤为复杂。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，指导模型遗忘特定数据。

Result: LetheViT在实验中表现优异，实现了隐私合规与模型性能的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的遗忘方法，解决了隐私法规下的数据删除挑战。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通组件和环路）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部拓扑特征，生成持久图（PDs）并向量化为多通道图像表示（TopoImage），进一步通过多视角TopoImages丰富表示。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上，TopoImages方法显著提高了分类准确率，优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法具有高度通用性，可无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，为数据分析和图像分类提供了新视角。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SECA的统一框架，通过利用文本先验的防遗忘性和结构性，解决持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）模型需要在不遗忘先前知识的情况下学习新任务，但现有方法在知识转移时未考虑语义相关性，导致任务间干扰。此外，视觉和文本分类器各有局限，缺乏语义精确性。

Method: 提出了SECA框架，包含两个模块：SG-AKT（基于文本线索评估新图像与历史知识的关联性）和SE-VPR（利用文本嵌入的类间语义关系优化视觉原型）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SECA的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA框架通过结合文本和视觉信息，显著提升了持续学习的性能，解决了稳定性与可塑性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: EgoLoc通过自适应采样和闭环反馈显著提升了零样本时序交互定位的性能，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Conclusion: SPL为领域迁移任务提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案，适用于现实世界动态变化的需求。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法难以学习连续时间动态和预测随机运动序列，且易忽视复杂运动的灵活性并导致模式崩溃。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：首阶段用时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列并引入锚点集；次阶段学习高斯混合分布并采样多序列以减少类内差异。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效解决了随机人体运动预测中的关键问题。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Conclusion: Pr^2R在保护隐私的同时，有效提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

TL;DR: SNARM提出了一种基于自参考学习的工业异常检测框架，通过动态比较测试图像块与自适应选择的参考块，结合Mamba模块实现高效异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练特征，难以动态适应异常检测需求，SNARM通过自参考学习提升异常区分能力。

Method: 计算测试图像块与训练特征库的残差，利用小残差块作为参考生成更多残差特征，结合多头Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，各项指标（Image-AUROC、Pixel-AURC等）均达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态导航机制，显著提升了工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Motivation: 解决多模态跟踪中跨模态特征融合的挑战，提出一种轻量且高效的适配器架构。

Result: 在五个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，仅需0.93M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计实现了高效的跨模态融合，为多模态跟踪提供了轻量且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于课程学习的框架CLIMD，用于处理不平衡多模态医疗数据，通过动态调整学习重点和类别分布，显著提升了诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态医疗数据中类别不平衡问题，避免现有方法（如重采样或损失重加权）导致的过拟合或欠拟合，并捕捉跨模态交互。

Method: 设计了多模态课程测量器（结合模态内置信度和模态间互补性）和类别分布引导的训练调度器，逐步适应复杂类别分布。

Result: 在多个多模态医疗数据集上表现优于现有方法，显著提升了处理不平衡数据的能力。

Conclusion: CLIMD作为一种即插即用的框架，可轻松集成到其他模型中，为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤亚型分类中因形态学差异细微和标注数据稀缺导致的挑战，提升零样本分类的细粒度特征捕捉能力。

Method: 提出FG-PAN框架，包含局部特征优化模块（建模代表性补丁的空间关系）和细粒度文本描述生成模块（利用大语言模型生成病理感知的语义原型）。

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上，FG-PAN实现了最先进的零样本分类性能。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过视觉与语义空间的对齐，显著提升了脑肿瘤亚型分类的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IAPL的新框架，通过自适应模块提升AI生成图像检测的灵活性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测未知生成器的伪造图像时泛化能力不足，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: IAPL包含两个模块：条件信息学习器和置信驱动自适应预测，前者学习伪造和图像特定条件，后者优化预测。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应调整输入图像的提示，显著提升了检测性能，适用于多种伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 图像地理定位在危机响应、数字取证和基于位置的情报中有重要应用，但LLMs在此任务中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过IMAGEO-Bench基准测试，评估了10种最先进的LLMs在三个多样化数据集上的表现，包括准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，但存在地理偏见，高资源地区（如北美、西欧）表现更好。成功定位依赖于识别城市环境、户外场景和地标。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严格评估，并为构建地理定位感知的AI系统提供了启示。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解任务中表现出色，能够生成更长的响应，提供更丰富的信息。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但性能不及深度学习方法，需提升其效率而不牺牲兼容性。

Method: 集成压缩导向的体素化网络与可微G-PCC替代模型，联合优化训练，实现端到端梯度传播。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，且无需修改解码器，无额外计算负担。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of

Conclusion: CDSR框架在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可实现高性能的WSI分析。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型的内部表示成功提取了通用可供性知识，为3D可供性预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Conclusion: MAP方法展示了基于语义地图的解码策略在提升LVLMs事实一致性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

TL;DR: ShapeMoE是一种形状特定的稀疏混合专家框架，用于模态分割，通过动态路由对象到适合其形状特征的专家，显著提升了遮挡区域分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一刀切方法因表示能力有限，难以处理多样化的模态形状。ShapeMoE通过引入形状感知的动态路由，解决了专家分配不匹配和专家利用不足的问题。

Method: ShapeMoE学习一个潜在形状分布空间，将每个对象编码为紧凑的高斯嵌入，并通过形状感知稀疏路由器动态路由到适合的轻量级专家。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE在遮挡区域分割中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状特定的专家路由，实现了高效且精确的模态分割，同时保持了高容量和可解释性。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein++是一个基于视觉基础模型(VFMs)的高效语义分割框架，通过域泛化(Rein-G)和域适应(Rein-A)解决数据规模差异和域分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs在语义分割中的应用受限于数据规模差异和域分布偏移，Rein++旨在克服这些挑战。

Method: Rein++包含Rein-G（域泛化）和Rein-A（域适应）。Rein-G通过可训练的实例感知令牌优化特征，Rein-A在实例和逻辑层面进行无监督域适应，并利用Segment Anything模型增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一个高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要系统研究补丁放置的影响。

Method: 构建PatchMap基准，评估1.5亿次前向传播；提出基于分割的启发式补丁放置方法，利用现成分割掩模识别脆弱区域。

Result: PatchMap揭示补丁放置的系统性热点；启发式方法在五种架构上攻击成功率提升8-13%。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其代码公开，未来将发布完整基准（6.5B预测），推动位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image方法将文本指令嵌入图像，统一视觉通道处理，显著提升Qwen2.5-VL性能，但导致LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能显著下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对Qwen2.5-VL有效，但需注意模型视觉编码器的适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

TL;DR: DisCo3D提出了一种新框架，通过将3D一致性先验知识蒸馏到2D编辑器中，解决了3D编辑中的多视图一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但扩展到3D编辑时，多视图一致性难以保持，现有方法存在收敛慢和模糊伪影等问题。

Method: DisCo3D通过微调3D生成器以适应场景，再通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后使用高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视图输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视图一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D有效解决了3D编辑中的多视图一致性问题，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PromptReg的无训练图像配准方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化了传统的两步区域匹配过程。


<details>

Motivation: 传统图像配准需要先分割感兴趣区域再匹配，步骤繁琐。本文旨在简化这一过程，利用预训练分割模型实现一步配准。

Method: 提出“对应提示问题”并通过“逆向提示”解决方案生成主提示和辅助提示，结合新的配准算法实现多对ROI匹配。

Result: 在多种医学和非医学图像配准任务中表现优异，优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至接近需要全标注数据的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过提示搜索简化了图像配准流程，展示了预训练模型在配准任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Motivation: 现有方法在给定首尾帧和文本提示下生成平滑合理的过渡视频方面研究不足，VTG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化技术，优化预训练模型的运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中表现优异，覆盖概念混合和场景过渡任务。

Conclusion: VTG在多种过渡任务中均展现出卓越性能，为统一过渡生成研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，将Conformer模型成功应用于手语识别，实现了新的最佳性能。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在处理视频时间定位任务时，未能区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出TimeExpert模型，采用MoE架构，动态路由任务特定令牌到专门专家，以提高计算效率和任务处理精度。

Result: TimeExpert在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等多种视频时间定位任务中均取得最优性能。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由机制，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian 通过充分利用新旧场景信息，优于从头重建地图的策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

Method: 提出GAID框架，包含帧级门控融合（FGF）和方向性自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别实现细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集（MSR-VTT、DiDeMo、LSMDC、VATEX）上取得最优检索效果，且效率显著提升。

Conclusion: GAID通过互补模块优化多模态表示，实现了高效且鲁棒的文本-视频检索。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an

distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT是一种多目标跟踪方法，通过联合利用外观和运动线索，解决了无人机视频中视角变化和复杂运动带来的跟踪挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中频繁的视角变化和复杂的运动动态导致跟踪不稳定和身份关联模糊，现有方法未能充分利用外观与运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出了AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），分别用于可靠的身份关联和减少轨迹断裂。

Result: 在VisDrone2019、UAVDT和VT-MOT-UAV三个基准测试中，AMOT表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过联合利用外观和运动线索，显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

TL;DR: SpectralX是一种参数高效微调框架，通过两阶段训练适应现有遥感基础模型（RSFMs），以处理多光谱/高光谱数据，提升领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱/高光谱数据缺乏对应的基础模型，研究如何利用现有RSFMs处理多样光谱模态，避免大量光谱预训练。

Method: 提出SpectralX框架，包括两阶段训练：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间与光谱维度属性；第二阶段引入Attribute-refined Adapter，迭代查询高低层语义特征。

Result: SpectralX能够解释新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX为多光谱/高光谱数据提供了一种高效适配现有RSFMs的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将语义特征附加到自由高斯分布上，导致分割噪声和高斯选择混乱，需要更有效的组织方式。

Method: 利用锚点图结构组织语义特征并规范高斯基元，实现紧凑且实例感知的高斯分布。

Result: 在四种应用中验证了方法的优势，包括交互式点击查询、开放词汇文本驱动查询、对象移除编辑和物理模拟。

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚点图结构实现了干净准确的实例级高斯选择，实验验证了其关键设计的有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法难以平衡主题和风格，且需要额外训练或涉及复杂超参数。

Method: EST-LoRA结合矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，类似MoE架构，自适应选择LoRA。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA是一种高效、无需训练的LoRA融合方法，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的新型灰盒越狱攻击方法，针对微调后的视觉语言模型（VLMs），通过模拟参数变化和优化提示，成功实现了高转移攻击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究揭示了微调开源VLMs可能继承基础模型的漏洞，导致安全风险，亟需开发全生命周期防御措施。

Method: SEA结合了Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation（FTS）和Targeted Prompt Guidance（TPG），分别模拟视觉编码器参数变化和优化语言解码器输出。

Result: 在Qwen2-VL系列模型上，SEA实现了86.5%的高转移攻击成功率和49.5%的毒性率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了保护微调VLMs免受基础模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，并呼吁开发更全面的防御策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Motivation: 长期动作预测在人机交互和辅助技术中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用手-物交互的细粒度视觉线索、忽略动词-名词语义依赖，且缺乏显式认知推理。

Method: INSIGHT分为两阶段：1）提取手-物交互特征并利用动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示；2）通过强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知-推理-预测）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中，INSIGHT实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合细粒度视觉特征和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程并改进信号质量，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型依赖包含敏感信息的大数据集，差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私但需要大量数据。数据集蒸馏（DD）高效但现有方法因同步采样-优化和噪声训练信号导致隐私信息利用不足。

Method: 提出新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过在信息子空间匹配减少DP噪声影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为之前方法的五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的效率与性能，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利密切相关，但人工监测耗时且不一致，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI算法进行实例分割与追踪，利用运动感知的卡尔曼滤波器和IoU数据关联。

Result: 系统在多目标追踪准确率（MOTA）和身份一致性（IDF1）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时追踪复杂环境中的奶牛，减少冗余检测，有望通过行为分类提升疾病早期预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言指令在复杂环境中导航时存在模糊性和冗长性问题，影响了导航效果。

Method: 提出视觉提示导航（VPN），利用2D俯视图标记导航轨迹；构建VPN任务数据集R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP；设计VPNet网络，采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、俯视图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN提供了一种直观且空间明确的导航方式，减少了解释模糊性，适合非专业用户。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM基准测试中表现优异，轨迹预测任务提升5.1%，端到端自动驾驶任务提升15%。

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion有效结合了栅格和图形表示的优势，显著提升了自动驾驶任务的性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式提供血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块有效学习解剖结构，具有竞争力。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在严重的物体幻觉问题，研究发现其原因是模态偏差，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整注意力权重和对比解码策略来缓解幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解和推理方面表现优异，但存在物体幻觉问题，传统研究认为是由视觉编码器与大型语言模型（LLMs）规模不匹配导致的。本文发现模态偏差是更深层次的原因，即模型无法同时关注视觉和文本信息。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过干预和调整视觉与文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差在LVLMs中普遍存在，所提方法在多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 模态偏差是LVLMs物体幻觉的关键原因，提出的注意力调整和对比解码方法具有普适性和高效性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在相机位姿估计中表现良好，尤其在噪声环境下具有较高的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合范式解决事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计即可在多任务中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因其非结构化分布和时空不均匀性，通常需要任务特定设计，限制了现有架构的复用性。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空域特征，利用空间填充曲线扩大感受野并提升效率，通过注意力融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，OmniEvent比任务特定SOTA方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent首次实现了事件数据的统一表示学习，为多任务处理提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文引导变换器（CGT）的熵模型，通过重新采样时间上下文和依赖加权的空间上下文，减少视频冗余并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂性和计算成本高的问题，且空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的显式建模。

Method: 设计了时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），分别优化时间和空间上下文建模。

Result: 实验表明，CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型在减少计算开销的同时提升了性能，为视频压缩提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于抽象视觉刺激和固定搜索轨迹，缺乏对真实场景的适用性，因此需要研究自由视觉搜索中的注视点分类。

Method: 通过36名参与者在140个真实场景（如桌面图标和工具搜索）中进行实验，结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 新方法在跨用户评估中准确率达83.6%，显著优于基于注视时长和眼跳相关电位的传统方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了真实场景中目标与非目标注视点的分类能力，为辅助系统提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内测试中，DiffusionFF表现出卓越的检测性能和精细的伪造定位能力。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测和定位深度伪造方面具有显著效果，提升了模型的可解释性和用户信任。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Motivation: 实时视频流理解在自动驾驶和智能监控等领域面临挑战，现有方法缺乏任务驱动规划和未来预测，限制了实时响应能力。

Result: 在流式和长视频理解任务中，方法在响应准确性和实时效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实用价值，能够高效实现主动决策和响应。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医学影像研究中大规模数据共享的需求增加，但患者隐私保护仍是一个挑战，现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法。

Method: 开发了一个包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI），并提供了一个评估框架，包括Python脚本、答案键和映射文件。

Result: MIDI数据集包含538名受试者、53,581个DICOM图像实例，支持自动化评估去标识化效果。

Conclusion: 该框架支持客观、标准化的去标识化评估，有助于更安全和一致的医学图像共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

TL;DR: EgoTrigger利用音频线索智能激活摄像头，显著降低能耗，同时保持人类记忆增强功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全天候智能眼镜需要高效的多模态AI代理，但持续传感带来能耗挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，通过手-物交互音频触发图像捕捉。

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能耗，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种高效节能的解决方案。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 工业检测中多任务模型的复杂性和维护成本高，希望通过统一视觉语言模型简化流程。

Method: 使用InspectVLM（基于Florence-2）和InspectMM数据集进行评估。

Result: 在分类和关键点任务中表现尚可，但在核心检测指标上不如ResNet，且对提示变化敏感，输出不稳定。

Conclusion: 当前统一视觉语言模型在工业检测中缺乏视觉基础和鲁棒性，尚不适合实际部署。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型解耦触发器和对象表示，通过视觉提示库和损失函数分离特征，实现零样本泛化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为后门攻击检测提供了新思路，尤其在处理未见配置时表现出色。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly

estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks

applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated
inspection.

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据量大，存储和处理成本高，需要一种高效的降采样方法。

Method: 分两步：1) 物体存在检测（无监督密度峰值分类器和有监督朴素贝叶斯分类器）；2) 采样预算分配策略。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，效率和效果均优。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到下游模型中，是自动驾驶点云降采样的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Result: 在Babel-QA和HuMMan数据集上表现优异，展示了跨数据集的适应性。

Conclusion: IMoRe框架通过隐式程序引导实现了高效且精确的运动推理，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLOS成像方法通常采用三维建模，忽略了隐藏物体的二维特性，导致计算和内存成本高，限制了实时高分辨率成像的实用性。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并通过Quasi-Fresnel变换建立测量数据与隐藏场景的直接反演公式。

Result: 相比现有方法，运行时间和内存需求降低数个数量级，同时保持成像质量，适用于轻量级设备。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动实时高分辨率NLOS成像的普及，并扩展其在更多平台上的应用。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以捕捉细节（如纹理），导致用户意图无法完全体现。图像提示方法虽能改善，但存在分类器自由引导中的冲突问题，且逼真度与对齐之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出冲突自由引导（conflict-free guidance），仅将图像提示作为期望条件；设计分层注意力（Stratified Attention），联合使用生成图像和图像提示的键值，而非二选一。

Result: 在三个图像生成任务中，所提方法在忠实反映图像提示方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过冲突自由引导和分层注意力，新方法有效解决了图像提示生成中的问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADVLMs的性能评估主要局限于开环设置，缺乏对交互行为和实际安全性的闭环评估，因此需要一种更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过双系统适应架构将ADVLMs适配到仿真环境，设计物理控制抽象层实现仿真到现实的闭环测试，并引入自反式场景生成模块探索模型行为。

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下的性能仍有局限，验证了Bench2ADVLM的诊断能力。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs提供了统一的闭环评估框架，揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户中心的隐私保护方法，通过3D面部签名动态生成自然外观的2D掩码，防止基于检索的面部识别技术侵犯隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别技术（如Clearview AI和PimEyes）被滥用，导致个人隐私泄露，如社交媒体活动和私人照片被未经同意地检索。

Method: Protego将用户的3D面部签名封装为姿态不变的2D表示，动态变形为自然外观的3D掩码，应用于在线分享前的图像。

Result: 实验表明，Protego显著降低了黑盒面部识别模型的检索准确率，性能至少是现有方法的2倍，且在视频中表现一致。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私，尤其在视频场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统放疗计划依赖专家经验且现有深度学习方法泛化性和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和渐进噪声去噪框架，使用多头注意力机制和复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于传统方法，MAE降至0.101-0.154，DICE系数提升6.8%，计划生成时间缩短至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了通用且高效的解决方案，有望显著提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的粗粒度标注无法满足自动驾驶对交通标志细粒度识别的需求，因此需要更精细的标注数据集。

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注细粒度交通标志类别，构建MVV数据集，并对比DINOv2与多种VLM模型的性能。

Result: DINOv2在交通标志识别及其他常见类别（如车辆和行人）上表现优于其他VLM模型，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在细粒度理解上的局限性。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2为自动驾驶场景中的密集语义匹配提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中计算资源利用不足、重复压缩导致的效率低下和质量损失问题。

Method: 采用HCF框架，通过潜在空间转换和策略驱动的量化控制优化率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR提升最高0.6dB，计算资源节省显著（如97.8% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: HCF在效率和性能上优于现有方法，支持无重训练的跨质量适应。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Motivation: 解决现有扩散方法在单目3D人体姿态估计中忽视时空相关性的问题，导致时间一致性差和预测精度低。

Method: 采用自回归扩散过程建模2D到3D姿态映射，结合历史姿态集成模块（HPIM）和时空物理引导（STPG）机制。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散和时空引导，显著提升了3D姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，难以提取关键临床信息，而现有结构化方法依赖预定义标签或模板，限制了表达的完整性和临床细节的准确性。

Method: 构建了一个临床相关且结构化的胸部X光数据集（MIMIC-STRUC），并训练了一个基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告。提出了一种新的评估指标（S-Score），专注于疾病预测准确性和临床关键细节的精确性。

Result: 该方法生成了高质量的标准化报告，并通过S-Score验证了其在临床决策中的有效性，与人评估更一致。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化评估指标（S-Score）为S-RRG提供了更临床相关的质量衡量标准，提升了报告生成的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track

essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in

continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在实时响应、物理可行性和安全性之间的冲突，提升人机交互的沉浸感和物理合理性。

Result: 在Inter-X和InterHuman数据集上表现优于现有方法，验证了其在虚拟现实和机器人交互中的实用性。

Conclusion: Human-X框架为人机协作提供了高效、安全的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合，解决了分布式开源LoRA模块的三大挑战，显著提升了图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模模型如FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3在图像生成方面取得进展，但其参数微调的复杂性限制了实际部署。现有LoRA模块面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略不足等问题。

Method: 框架包括两部分：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，动态计算融合权重。

Result: 显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的可扩展和数据高效增强。

Conclusion: 该工作为社区开发的LoRA模块与实际部署需求之间建立了桥梁，通过标准化适配器集成促进了协作模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光晕与背景信息混淆而具有挑战性，现有方法在保持上下文一致性方面表现不佳。

Method: 利用状态空间模型的高效序列建模能力，设计分层框架和局部增强的状态空间模型，捕捉长距离像素关联并保留局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除散射和反射光晕，同时保持非光晕区域的自然外观，并提升下游视觉任务性能。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，展示了其在复杂光晕去除中的优越性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

TL;DR: 提出NRE-Net，一种多模态检测框架，融合RGB图像、事件流和法线图，显著提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下物体检测对自动驾驶等应用至关重要，但现有RGB或事件数据单独使用效果不佳，且缺乏额外传感器时的解决方案。

Method: 提出NRE-Net，融合RGB图像、事件流和法线图，通过ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net显著优于现有方法，mAP50提升最高达7.9%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合有效解决了恶劣光照下的物体检测问题，为实际应用提供了可靠方案。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Result: 显著提升动态建模效果，快速移动物体的新视角合成PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了动态场景建模中的时序一致性和快速移动物体问题。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经网络质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方法。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）训练一个神经网络，输入参考和近似BRDF样本，预测其感知质量（JOD分数）。

Result: 该神经网络度量方法比现有BRDF空间度量方法更符合人类感知判断。

Conclusion: 该方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，但在BRDF拟合中作为损失函数的性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行处理长视频帧，显著提升了视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLM）在长视频场景中的性能，同时降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-MLLMs受限于底层LLMs的上下文长度限制，在长视频场景中表现不佳。常见解决方案如令牌压缩和流式推理会牺牲特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，通过重构视觉令牌为多参考短序列，并行处理并融合关键令牌，实现长视频帧的高效理解。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Free-MoRef实现了对2倍至8倍长输入帧的全面感知，性能显著提升，甚至超过专门训练的长视频MLLMs。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef通过创新的多参考机制，高效解决了长视频理解问题，为视频多模态大语言模型提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 研究航拍图像在自动驾驶感知任务中的潜力，特别是在高清地图不可用或维护成本高的情况下。

Method: 通过SLAM点云地图将航拍图像与nuScenes坐标系对齐，提出校正流程和人工质量控制，发布高质量对齐数据。

Result: 航拍图像使地图构建准确率提升15-23%，轨迹预测性能提升2%。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展的环境上下文来源，AID4AD数据集公开以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Motivation: 真实监控场景中的步态识别因非周期性和遮挡问题难以解决，现有方法在非受控环境下表现不佳。

Method: 提出随机轨迹采样平衡鲁棒性与多样性，Haar小波下采样保留信息，硬度排除三元组损失过滤低质量样本。

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅需10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在真实场景中表现优异，为步态识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未参考的分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在美学属性的细粒度控制上存在不足，尤其是需要连续和强度特定调整时，依赖模糊文本提示或高成本数据，限制了可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 通过预训练视觉语言模型的语义相似性量化抽象美学，使用轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到可学习嵌入，实现美学属性的直观定制控制。

Result: 实验表明，AttriCtrl能准确控制单个属性并灵活组合多属性，且与现有生成框架完全兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl在美学控制上具有高精度和灵活性，实用性强，适用于多样化生成场景。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Result: 在无噪声图像上表现与ADMM方法相当，在高斯噪声污染图像上去噪效果更优。

Conclusion: CP框架在CSC和CDL中具有高效性和快速收敛性，尤其在噪声去除方面表现突出。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Result: 实验表明，DreamPainter显著优于现有方法，保持高产品一致性并有效整合多模态信息。

Conclusion: DreamPainter为电商背景生成提供了高效解决方案，结合多模态控制信号提升生成质量。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 统一模型在RGB图像中实现了高效的类别级姿态估计，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all

exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设单一光源或均匀光照，无法处理实际场景中的复杂光照问题，如多色光源和材料反射。

Method: 提出了一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度组件指导，实现光照与反射的精确分离。

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上表现优异，解决了光照不一致、纹理泄漏和颜色失真等问题，计算成本低。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和提出的方法为复杂光照下的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

TL;DR: GaussianCross提出了一种跨模态自监督3D表示学习架构，通过3D高斯喷洒技术解决现有模型崩溃和结构信息不足的问题，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法因点云判别难度不足导致模型崩溃和结构信息缺失，影响性能和可靠性。

Method: 采用3D高斯喷洒技术将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并引入三属性自适应蒸馏喷洒模块构建3D特征场。

Result: 在ScanNet等基准测试中表现优异，参数和数据效率高，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GaussianCross通过跨模态一致性特征捕获，显著提升了3D场景理解的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于HIPAA安全港方法的Python算法，用于去标识化DICOM文件中的个人和健康识别信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于HIPAA和隐私法规的要求，DICOM文件中的个人可识别信息（PII）和个人健康识别信息（PHI）需要被隐藏或移除，以符合法律要求。

Method: 研究团队实现了一种基于HIPAA安全港方法的算法，通过可自定义输入参数对DICOM标签进行分类和去标识化。

Result: 算法成功识别并去标识化了敏感信息，如姓名、病史、个人数据和机构信息。

Conclusion: 开发的Python算法具有高度灵活性，适用于日常使用和研究目的，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播引发信任危机，现有方法缺乏对弱监督多模态细粒度时序伪造定位的系统研究。

Method: 结合视觉和音频模态检测任务，采用多任务学习框架和Mixture-of-Experts结构，提出特征增强模块和时序偏差感知损失。

Result: 实验表明WMMT在弱监督条件下性能接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: WMMT为弱监督多模态时序伪造定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对量化模型的持续零阶适应（ZOA）框架，通过仅需两次前向传播实现高效适应，解决了现有方法依赖梯度反向传播的问题，并在多个架构上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度反向传播而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播，并结合域知识管理方案以减少干扰并促进知识积累。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型提供了一种高效且鲁棒的适应方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 论文揭示了对抗训练中硬对抗样本的过度学习是导致准确性与鲁棒性权衡的原因，并提出了一种新的鲁棒感知对抗训练方法（RPAT）来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为对抗训练中硬对抗样本的不足学习导致决策边界复杂化，从而引发准确性与鲁棒性的权衡。本文首次提出相反的观点，即过度学习硬对抗样本才是问题的根源。

Method: 提出了一种名为鲁棒感知的新对抗训练目标，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化，并基于此设计了RPAT方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等数据集上的实验表明，RPAT方法优于4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过平滑感知过渡有效缓解了准确性与鲁棒性的权衡问题，为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

TL;DR: CAM（内容自适应Mamba）通过内容感知的令牌重组和全局先验集成，解决了传统Mamba在图像压缩中的局限性，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型在图像压缩中因内容无关性和固定扫描方式，无法充分利用内容依赖关系。

Method: 提出CAM，采用内容感知令牌重组和全局先验提示字典，动态优化内容依赖和计算效率。

Result: CMIC模型在多个基准测试中超越VTM-21.0，BD-rate显著降低。

Conclusion: CAM显著提升了图像压缩的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Motivation: WSI分析在癌症诊断中至关重要，但处理大尺寸WSI需要大量资源。现有系统需要高效适应新任务而不重新训练旧任务。

Method: 提出COSFormer框架，基于Transformer，支持多任务WSI分析，避免重新访问历史数据集。

Result: 在七个WSI数据集和六个任务上测试，COSFormer在持续学习框架中表现优越。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床WSI分析中持续学习的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件的单积分（ESI）方法，用于实时高帧率强度图像重建，适用于无人机视觉跟踪等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和高时间分辨率等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息是实现其潜力的关键。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法重建强度图像，实现高帧率（100 FPS）实时处理。

Result: ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升了无人机在恶劣视觉环境下的感知能力。

Conclusion: ESI方法在极低光照条件下（2-10lux）表现出色，适用于无人机机载视觉跟踪，解决了其他算法因帧率不足或实时性差而失败的问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的基于泰勒展开的加速方法，通过将预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，并引入动态缓存机制，显著提升了推理速度且质量损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）在视觉生成任务中表现优异，但推理速度慢限制了其在低资源应用中的部署。现有方法存在内存和计算开销大、固定缓存调度导致输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级以减少缓存特征数量；利用第一个块的预测误差作为可靠性指标，动态决定是否信任泰勒预测或回退到完整计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17倍、2.36倍和4.14倍的加速，且质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Result: 在三个公开数据集上性能优于现有方法，分别提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: I2CR框架通过文本优先和视觉辅助策略有效解决了多模态实体链接的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Motivation: 减轻标注负担，提升伪标签的可靠性。

Method: 采用导数标签传播方法，对像素级特征向量施加离散导数操作作为额外正则化。

Conclusion: DerProp通过严格正则化的相似性度量，有效解决了伪标签的不可靠问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和高效聚合策略，实现了更优的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing

*Peng Zhang,Zhihui Lai,Heng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，用于解决超声图像分类和分割任务中伪标签选择过于自信但错误的问题，并通过任务间注意力模块和一致性学习策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中基于置信度的伪标签选择容易产生过度自信但错误的预测，且分类与分割任务独立处理，未能充分利用任务间的关联性。

Method: 提出Hermes策略，结合对比学习和半监督学习，引入任务间注意力模块和一致性学习策略，优化伪标签选择和特征对齐。

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集和一个私有数据集上，Hermes在多种半监督设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过任务间信息共享和一致性学习，显著提升了超声图像分类和分割的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，通过直接匹配高区分度的区域描述符，显著提升了区域匹配的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM框架的研究依赖于低效的像素级比较和复杂的图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD通过生成高区分度的区域描述符实现直接匹配，无需复杂图优化；采用分类和排序子任务的监督策略；引入HCRF消除重叠区域。

Result: SGAD在多个点匹配器中表现优异，运行时间减少60倍，户外姿态估计准确率提升（65.98 vs. 61.11），室内姿态估计AUC@5°提升7.39%。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新方法显著提升了区域匹配的性能和效率，成为新的SOTA。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在医学图像分割中，通过边缘增强预训练基础模型对跨模态分割性能的影响，并提出了一种基于元学习的策略来选择最优预训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割需要大量计算资源和数据，现有研究表明预训练和微调基础模型能提升性能，但图像预处理步骤对不同模态的影响尚不明确。

Method: 研究使用两种预训练方式（原始数据和边缘增强数据），并在多种医学成像模态上微调，提出元学习策略选择最优预训练方法。

Result: 边缘增强预训练在不同模态上表现不一，元学习策略整体提升了16.42%（相比仅边缘增强）和19.30%（相比仅原始数据）。

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能显著提升跨模态分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

TL;DR: 提出了一种仅依赖事件相机的立体3D物体检测框架，通过双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并在动态环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统传感器在高动态场景中的感知间隙问题，利用事件相机的高时间分辨率特性。

Method: 提出双滤波器机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框以增强回归。

Result: 在动态环境中优于现有方法，验证了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 事件相机可独立用于鲁棒的3D物体检测，无需依赖传统3D传感器。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confident Meta-learning (CoMet)方法，用于深度异常检测，无需手动筛选数据，通过软置信学习和元学习提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测依赖纯正常数据，需人工筛选且引入偏差。CoMet旨在直接从含异常的训练数据中学习，提高适应性。

Method: 结合Soft Confident Learning（低置信样本降权）和Meta-Learning（基于验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强噪声鲁棒性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VIADUCT和KSDD2数据集上优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的训练策略，能有效处理未筛选数据，提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Result: 在心血管疾病、糖尿病、慢性阻塞性肺病和慢性肾病等多种疾病中表现优于传统全身放射组学方法。

Conclusion: 全身表征学习可作为独立筛查工具或多模态框架的一部分，用于早期个性化风险评估。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗中的潜在错误需要人机协作，而延迟决策是关键。现有学习式延迟方法可能受数据偏移影响，不确定性量化方法可能更具鲁棒性。

Method: 通过大型眼科数据集，对比学习式延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在分布内外的表现，评估其分类青光眼的能力和延迟决策效果。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在分布外数据中表现更优，可能更适合作为AI延迟策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法在医疗AI延迟决策中具有潜力，尤其是在面对分布外数据时。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 结合指令对比学习和描述性信息可显著提升VLMs的细粒度理解能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化公共空间和优化损失函数，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控和灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

TL;DR: OTIP是一种基于最优传输理论的零样本框架，用于在整流流模型中实现图像反转，平衡重建保真度和编辑灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像反转中重建保真度与编辑灵活性之间的平衡问题。

Method: 利用最优传输理论指导反转过程，通过轨迹优化平衡重建精度和编辑可控性。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，LPIPS为0.001，SSIM为0.992，重建损失提升7.8%至12.9%。

Conclusion: OTIP在保持计算效率的同时，实现了高保真重建和语义一致的编辑效果。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元识别的效率提升受限于缺乏多样化和动态的真实数据集。

Method: 提出TRUDI数据集（35,034标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、ID定位、识别验证）。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: 公开TRUDI数据集支持新方法开发，提升港口物流效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成和评估框架，解决了布局生成中的任务特定性和评估问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感任务提供了有力支持，并指明了未来探索方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，减少对聚类方法和后处理的依赖。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成伪标签，结合自训练优化检测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种简单有效的零样本无监督模型，具有潜力推动领域进步。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Hydra的创新方法，结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术，通过检测叶片上的水分来测量叶片湿润持续时间（LWD），并在多种环境条件下实现了高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LWD检测方法缺乏标准化测量技术，且对不同植物特性的适应性不足，导致在实际农业应用中的精度和鲁棒性较差。

Method: Hydra结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术，设计了一个CNN用于融合多模态图像，并通过基于Transformer的编码器生成特征图，最终通过分类器进行检测。

Result: Hydra在多种场景下对叶片湿润的分类准确率高达96%，在恶劣环境（如雨天或弱光夜晚）下仍能保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra方法在LWD检测中表现出高精度和强鲁棒性，为实际农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former为解决多元时间序列分析问题提供了一种有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的AI方法，直接从MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总体生存期（OS），无需肿瘤分割，简化流程并减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，生存期短。预测OS对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免传统方法中的肿瘤分割步骤。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达62.5%，且在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新设计和训练策略，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能，为相关应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

Motivation: 解决SAM模型在密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）中因稀疏提示导致的意图理解不足问题。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化让模型隐式学习目标类特征，无需依赖语言模型。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法，性能提升超9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型提供了一种新的意图感知对齐范式，无需辅助提示生成器或语言模型。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足要求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力，能够适应不同类别标签可用性的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过多角度监督，有效提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究为多镜头fMRI重建提供了新范式，通过分解和语义提示实现了复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和上下文信息，显著提升了深度补全的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型多模态模型（LMMs）预测短视频用户参与度的有效性，比较了两种模型（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL）的性能，并展示了音频特征的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长使得用户参与度预测对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模多模态特征间的交互。

Method: 采用两种LMMs（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL）预测用户参与度，分别整合不同模态特征（音频、视觉、语言或仅视觉、语言），并在SnapUGC数据集上训练。

Result: 两种模型均表现出色，VideoLLaMA2因整合音频特征表现更优，通过模型集成在ICCV VQualA 2025竞赛中取得第一名。

Conclusion: LMMs在用户参与度预测中具有显著潜力，音频特征的整合对提升性能尤为重要。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了艺术斑马线对预训练视觉行人检测模型的影响，发现复杂艺术图案会显著降低检测性能，且对抗性设计可被利用来干扰检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线虽提升行人安全，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统，需研究其对行人检测的影响。

Method: 通过合成不同艺术图案到固定监控场景，评估模型在普通和对抗性艺术斑马线上的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，对抗性设计可故意遮挡行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调在设计鲁棒行人感知模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，根据天气和光照条件优化带宽使用，提升车辆检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通系统中带宽限制导致的实时性能问题，同时减少视频质量损失对车辆检测精度的影响。

Method: 使用PAVC框架，动态调整视频压缩级别以适应环境变化，优化带宽和检测精度。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，带宽需求减少8.23倍（中等带宽）或72倍（极低带宽）。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡带宽需求和检测精度，适用于不同带宽环境。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

TL;DR: MonoDream是一个轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，通过统一导航表示（UNR）和潜在全景梦境（LPD）任务，提升单目输入在视觉语言导航（VLN）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景RGB-D传感器在现实部署中成本高或难以获取，而现有基于单目输入的VLA模型性能仍落后于全景方法。

Method: MonoDream通过UNR联合对齐导航相关的视觉语义和语言动作意图，并引入LPD任务监督UNR，预测潜在全景特征。

Result: 实验表明，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream为单目输入提供了一种高效且可靠的导航解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

TL;DR: ReMoMask是一个统一的文本到运动生成框架，通过双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-Classifier-Free Guidance三项创新，解决了现有方法的多样性不足、物理不合理性和异步伪影等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法面临多样性不足、物理不合理性和异步伪影等挑战，ReMoMask旨在通过创新技术解决这些问题。

Method: ReMoMask结合了双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-Classifier-Free Guidance，提升了跨模态检索精度和运动生成的物理合理性。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，ReMoMask的FID分数分别比RAG-T2M提高了3.88%和10.97%。

Conclusion: ReMoMask在文本到运动生成任务中表现出色，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

<details>

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA基准测试中的评估通常忽略性能方差，导致结果不可靠。本文旨在揭示这一问题并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试中的方差，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估的有效性。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著，Cloze式评估能减少随机性。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知的评估方法，以促进MLLMs的更稳健发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMGS提出了一种基于3D高斯抛射的运动重建方法，通过目标建模和运动恢复两阶段流程，结合物理一致性和动态优化策略，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动态重建方法主要局限于短时小规模变形，且缺乏物理一致性考虑，PMGS旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: PMGS采用两阶段流程：目标建模（动态场景分解与改进点密度控制）和运动恢复（学习每帧SE(3)位姿）。引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并结合卡尔曼融合优化误差。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过物理约束和动态优化策略，为复杂刚体运动重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

Motivation: 解决医学领域缺乏开放、可复现的大型推理模型构建方法的问题，推动社区研究和比较。

Method: 通过系统数据筛选（文本和多模态数据）和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR）构建模型。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，纯文本数据训练效果更好，7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到SOTA，32B模型性能媲美GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医学多模态推理研究提供了强大的开放基础。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT是一种高效、自包含的提示调优方法，无需额外知识。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种在多阶段复杂任务中优化测试时计算资源分配的方法AgentTTS，通过LLM代理自主搜索最优分配方案，显著提升了搜索效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段任务的测试时计算资源分配，而现实中的多阶段复杂任务需要针对不同子任务分配特定能力和预算，因此需要解决这一新问题。

Method: 通过实验总结三个经验性见解，并基于此提出AgentTTS框架，利用LLM代理通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优模型和预算分配。

Result: 实验表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率和性能上显著优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线，且对训练集大小变化具有更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段复杂任务中的测试时计算资源分配提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊框架ff4ERA，用于量化伦理风险，支持人工智能在伦理决策中的透明和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险增加，需要一种灵活且透明的框架来评估和优先处理这些风险。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化风险。

Result: 案例研究表明ff4ERA能生成上下文敏感的伦理风险评分，验证了模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ff4ERA框架为伦理决策提供了可解释、可追踪的风险评估，支持设计者进行可靠的伦理决策。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in

### [334] [An analysis of AI Decision under Risk: Prospect theory emerges in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00902)
*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文测试了大型语言模型（LLM）在风险决策中是否表现出与人类相似的‘前景理论’行为，发现其与人类行为一致，且情境（如军事与民用）对风险偏好的影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Kahneman和Tversky的前景理论是否适用于LLM，并探讨情境对风险决策的影响。

Method: 通过实验测试LLM在不同情境下的风险决策行为，分析其与前景理论的契合度。

Result: LLM在风险决策中表现出与人类相似的前景理论行为，且军事情境下的‘框架效应’更强。

Conclusion: 语言模型捕捉了人类的启发式与偏见，但偏见分布不均，情境（‘语言游戏’）是关键。研究还重新审视了LLM的推理与记忆之争。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CHECK是一个基于语义分析的知识编辑框架，用于提升多跳问答（MQA）任务中的推理准确性，通过逻辑优化和重新提示LLM模型，平均提高了22.8%的MQA准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在处理需要组合推理的任务（如多跳问答）时表现不佳，导致推理过程不合逻辑。

Method: CHECK框架借鉴编译器的思路，先对推理链进行语义分析，修正语义错误，再通过逻辑优化和重新提示LLM模型（提高温度）确保一致性。

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK相比五种最先进框架，平均提升了22.8%的MQA准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化，显著提升了多跳问答任务的推理准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代EDA工作流依赖手动脚本和工具交互，效率低且难以扩展，现有LLM解决方案需昂贵微调且缺乏标准化框架。

Method: AutoEDA利用MCP协议实现并行学习，通过结构化提示工程减少微调，结合智能参数提取和任务分解，并扩展CodeBLEU评估脚本质量。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoEDA在自动化准确性、效率和脚本质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoEDA开源发布，支持EDA社区，提供标准化和可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.
AutoEDA is released open-sourced to support reproducibility and the EDA

Motivation: 人类错误导致的多车碰撞频发，凸显了自动驾驶系统通过V2X通信提升感知能力的必要性。现有方法在泛化性、上下文推理和多模态输入方面存在不足。

Method: REACT结合轻量级VLM和专用模块处理多模态输入，优化风险感知轨迹，并通过边缘适应策略实现实时性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM在实时边缘协同规划中可行，语言引导的上下文推理能显著提升自动驾驶的安全性和响应性。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec使研究人员和实践者能在实际时间预算内训练高质量的大规模知识图谱嵌入。

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 揭示生成式AI输出突然变坏的原因，以减少经济损失和法律风险。

Method: 建立多自旋热系统的数学映射，推导临界点公式，分析多层架构的放大效应。

Result: 发现了AI输出的临界点，揭示了用户提示和训练偏见的影响，并展示了多层架构的放大作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于提高AI的透明度和性能，并为量化用户风险和法律责任提供了路径。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

Motivation: 探索社会经济指标（如家庭财富）是否可以通过卫星图像和网络文本的物理特征和历史/经济叙事来预测。

Method: 使用多模态框架，结合卫星图像、LLM生成文本和AI代理检索的文本，通过五种管道预测家庭财富。

Result: 多模态融合方法（R-squared 0.77）优于单一视觉模型（0.63），LLM内部知识比代理检索文本更有效。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法在财富预测中表现优越，验证了部分表示收敛假设，并发布了一个大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在轨迹预测中表现优异，但存在灾难性遗忘问题，限制了其在自动驾驶等动态场景中的应用。

Method: H2C通过两种互补策略选择代表性样本，并通过记忆回放损失函数更新模型，以保留知识。

Result: 实验表明，H2C在无任务依赖的情况下，平均减少了22.71%的灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: H2C为动态场景下的轨迹预测提供了一种有效的持续学习方法。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情感推理中忽视情感冲突场景，导致对音频信号的过度依赖，需要新的解决方案。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试（包括CA-MER）中表现优异，特别是在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效解决了情感冲突问题，提升了多模态情感推理的性能，且不牺牲任何模态的表现。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

Motivation: 探索CoT推理是否真正反映模型的推理能力，还是仅依赖于训练数据的分布。

Method: 通过DataAlchemy环境，从零训练LLM，并在任务、长度和格式三个维度上系统分析CoT推理。

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时表现脆弱，效果受限。

Conclusion: CoT推理并非真正的泛化推理能力，其有效性依赖于数据分布的一致性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Result: 在8,000个评估点上，BIS的平均绝对预测误差为1.1%，适用于多种指标。

Conclusion: BIS可靠且广泛适用，可显著降低代码相关任务中LLM的评估成本。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

TL;DR: SketchAgent是一个多智能体系统，旨在将手绘草图自动转换为结构化图表，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手绘草图虽自然高效，但缺乏结构约束和语义精确性，难以自动生成机器可读图表。

Method: SketchAgent结合草图识别、符号推理和迭代验证，生成语义连贯且结构准确的图表。

Result: 提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark，包含8类图表和6000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计、教育和工程中具有潜力，填补了草图与机器可读图表间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

TL;DR: MoE-MLA-RoPE结合了混合专家、多头潜在注意力和旋转位置嵌入，通过细粒度专家路由、共享专家隔离和无梯度冲突负载平衡，实现了高效语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型容量与计算效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用64个微专家和top-k选择、共享专家隔离、无梯度冲突负载平衡。

Result: KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展定义了资源受限语言模型的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型因其高效性和可部署性在资源受限环境中受到重视，但成员推理攻击对其隐私和知识产权的威胁尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了一种基于min-k的改进攻击方法win-k，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有攻击方法，尤其是在更小的模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种有效的成员推理攻击方法，特别适用于小型语言模型，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

TL;DR: 论文提出知识冲突推理（KCR）框架，通过强化学习训练LLMs在长且冲突的上下文中选择逻辑一致的推理路径，显著提升模型解决知识冲突的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的普及，知识冲突在多源上下文中愈发常见，而现有模型在长且冲突的上下文中表现不佳。

Method: KCR框架通过提取文本或局部知识图的推理路径，利用强化学习奖励模型选择逻辑一致的路径。

Result: 实验表明，KCR显著提升了多种骨干模型在长上下文场景中解决知识冲突的能力。

Conclusion: KCR框架有效增强了LLMs在复杂知识冲突中的推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: Multi-TW展示了模型能力，并强调了对传统中文微调和高效多模态架构的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个实用工具，有望推动新科学假设的发现。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

Motivation: LLMs在规划任务中常生成错误或虚构的动作，现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对计划质量的全面分析。

Method: 提出一个包含NLP评估和三阶段恢复的管道，通过NLP操作改进LLM生成的计划，最终使用符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 恢复管道将成功率从21.9%提升至27.5%，但平均仅前2.65个动作可执行，且计划质量仍低于传统规划器。

Conclusion: LLMs在规划任务中缺乏底层推理能力，NLP恢复管道虽能部分改进计划质量，但仍无法达到传统规划器的可靠性。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题。现有方法依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，但效果有限。

Method: PUZZLED设计了三种字谜类型（单词搜索、字谜重组、填字游戏），要求LLM解谜后生成有害指令的响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率达88.8%，其中GPT-4.1为96.5%，Claude 3.7 Sonnet为92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单但强大的字谜策略，有效利用LLM的推理能力，成为一种高效的越狱攻击方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Conclusion: 人类需转向“半人马”式人机协作，政策应促进福利最大化的均衡。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Result: 在多个指标上优于现有方法，且对噪声具有高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了封闭世界假设的局限性，为位置预测提供了更灵活和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why

TL;DR: CARGO框架优化电动车辆配送路线和充电计划，显著降低充电成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车辆配送因电池容量限制需优化充电计划，解决充电点可用性、成本等问题。

Method: 提出MILP精确解和高效启发式方法，并对比基准策略EDF和NDF。

Result: 充电成本分别降低39%和22%，完成配送量相当。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在电动车辆配送中高效且经济。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Motivation: 解决多智能体路径规划中动力学模型简化导致的问题，提高路径执行的可行性和质量。

Method: 提出kTPG算法优化MAPF计划为动力学可行路径，并开发WinkTPG框架动态执行计划。

Result: WinkTPG能在1秒内为1000个智能体生成速度曲线，解决方案质量提升51.7%。

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了MAPF执行中的动力学和不确定性挑战，提升了多智能体路径规划的效率和质量。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

TL;DR: Refine-n-Judge是一种自动化迭代方法，利用单个LLM作为数据精炼器和评估器，无需人工标注即可提升数据集质量，显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工反馈成本高且难以扩展，需要一种自动化方法来提升数据集质量。

Method: 利用单个LLM迭代生成改进并评估每次改进，直到无法进一步优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，使用Refine-n-Judge优化的模型在74%的比较中优于原始数据集训练的模型，性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，显著提升模型性能，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否继承人类认知偏见，尤其是承诺升级现象，以及这些偏见在何种条件下显现。

Method: 通过四组实验（个体决策、模型作为顾问、多代理讨论、复合压力场景）共6,500次试验，分析LLMs的行为。

Result: 个体决策中LLMs表现理性，但多代理对称决策时几乎普遍出现承诺升级（99.2%），复合压力下也有显著偏见（68.95%）。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见表现取决于社会和组织环境，这对多代理系统和无人监督部署有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

Result: 总结了LMs在各阶段的关键进展，并展示了如何与其他技术结合以优化数据准备任务。

Conclusion: LMs在表格数据准备中具有巨大潜力，但仍需进一步研究以系统化其应用。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和逐个解决子目标，有效提升了零样本泛化能力，适用于复杂任务和安全约束。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Conclusion: PCF支持可扩展、动态、可解释和伦理的AI应用，为下一代多态代理铺平道路。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Motivation: 填补LLMs在定量化学推理能力方面的研究空白。

Method: 设计QCBench基准，包含7个化学子领域的350个问题，分三个难度层级。

Result: 评估19个LLMs，发现随着任务复杂度增加，性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在语言流畅性和科学计算准确性之间存在差距。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型任务中因知识过时或不完整而受限，现有GraphRAG方法忽略了知识的时间动态性。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图谱生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有RAG和GraphRAG基线。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对于鲁棒的长文本问答至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻放射科医生的工作负担，同时解决医学报告生成中的三大不确定性来源（视觉、标签分布和上下文），以提高系统的临床可信度。

Method: 采用Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块纠正视图标注错误；Token Sensitive Learning目标增强关键诊断句的建模；Contextual Evidence Filter验证并选择性整合历史信息。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度减少不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准，并推动了可信临床决策支持的发展。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Result: 定量评估、案例研究和用户研究表明，CoT框架显著提升了NL2VIS的质量和用户理解。

Conclusion: CoT框架不仅提高了可视化生成效果，还为用户提供了透明的推理过程，增强了交互性。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了动态柔性作业车间调度问题中的关键缺陷，显著优于直接LLM方法和传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态柔性作业车间调度（DFJSP）是一个NP难问题，传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，深度学习方法需要复杂特征工程且不透明。LLM虽具潜力，但直接应用存在长上下文悖论、启发式利用不足和短视决策等问题。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，通过LLM分析多时间跨度的启发式模拟，生成“战略经验”摘要，并将其整合到最终决策模块的提示中，以指导非短视决策。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基线（71.35%胜率，2.755%相对百分比偏差降低），并超越所有评估的启发式方法，同时缓解了三大缺陷。

Conclusion: ReflecSched展示了LLM在复杂调度问题中的潜力，通过战略分析能力实现高效、非短视的决策，性能与最佳启发式方法相当。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种可解释的概率推理框架，显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性，为自动化科学发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Result: 实验表明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，能有效处理大规模问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为条件时间间隔和累积函数调度问题提供了可行的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为未来的推理系统分析提供基础结构，特别是在内部失败、适应或分裂可能发生的场景中。

Method: 将推理系统建模为包含现象、解释空间、推理和生成映射以及原则基的结构化元组。

Result: 框架支持统一的结构化表示，涵盖多种推理过程，并允许动态行为和失败模式分析。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在为推理系统的表示和比较提供基础，支持未来的理论和实践研究。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的自动化过程奖励数据构建框架，结合混合多数奖励投票和加权奖励频率投票方法，提升了数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励数据构建方法效率低或劳动密集，限制了过程级奖励模型（PRMs）的发展。

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的自动化数据生成和标注框架，并引入两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法显著提高了PRMs的性能，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器和小规模工具，无法有效评估大规模真实场景中的代理能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool服务器和工具集、LiveMCPEval自动化评估框架，以及MCP Copilot Agent。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为大规模、动态MCP环境中的代理能力评估提供了首个统一框架。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

Motivation: 云环境中异常检测任务关键但挑战大，现有基于指标的方法因数据不平衡导致高误报率，增加了运维负担。

Method: 提出CloudAnoAgent，首个基于神经符号LLM的代理，联合处理指标和日志数据，利用符号验证生成结构化异常报告。

Result: 实验显示，CloudAnoAgent平均提升异常分类准确率46.36%和36.67%，降低误报率36.67%和33.89%，异常类型检测准确率提升12.8%。

Conclusion: CloudAnoAgent在准确性、误报率和可解释性上表现优异，适合企业云环境部署。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

TL;DR: ProKG Dial是一个利用领域知识图谱构建高质量多轮对话数据集的渐进式框架，显著提升了对话质量和领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在专业领域缺乏精确性，而构建高质量领域专用对话数据集的方法资源密集或质量有限。

Method: ProKG Dial通过社区检测分割知识图谱为语义子图，逐步生成围绕目标实体的问答对，并进行严格过滤。

Result: 生成的对话在多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖方面表现优异，微调后的模型显著优于基线。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial有效解决了领域对话数据集的构建挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化方法，用于构建多轮自然语言到图查询语言（NL2GQL）的数据集，并开发了MTGQL数据集。同时，提出了三种基线方法评估多轮NL2GQL翻译的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单轮NL2GQL方法无法有效处理多轮对话和复杂上下文依赖，且缺乏高质量多轮数据集。

Method: 基于LLM的自动化方法构建多轮NL2GQL数据集，并开发MTGQL数据集；提出三种基线方法评估效果。

Result: 成功构建了MTGQL数据集，并提出了基线方法，为未来研究奠定基础。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了多轮NL2GQL研究的空白，为复杂场景下的查询转换提供了支持。

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: SNOW是一种基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自动生成结构化特征，性能接近人工特征生成方法，同时显著优于其他自动化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但提取有用特征仍具挑战性。现有方法要么依赖人工，要么缺乏可解释性和临床相关性。

Method: SNOW采用模块化多代理系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动完成特征发现、提取、验证、后处理和聚合。

Result: SNOW在预测5年前列腺癌复发任务中表现接近人工特征生成（AUC-ROC: 0.761 vs. 0.771），显著优于基线特征（0.691）和其他自动化方法。

Conclusion: SNOW展示了自主LLM系统能够大规模复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 解决角色扮演代理（RPA）在回答超出知识范围问题时角色一致性的挑战。

Method: 结合自适应上下文感知文本分割器（ACTS）、引导选择（GS）和属性提取器（AE），构建CharacterRAG数据集。

Result: 框架成功建模角色知识和个性，数据集包含15个角色和450个问答对。

Conclusion: AMADEUS框架在角色扮演任务中表现出色，尤其在角色一致性方面。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

TL;DR: TraceAlign是一个统一框架，用于追踪大型语言模型（LLMs）生成不安全内容的原因，并提出三种干预措施以减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在对抗性提示或解码扰动下产生不安全内容的原因，并开发可追溯的解决方案。

Method: 引入Belief Conflict Index（BCI）量化语义不一致性，提出TraceShield、Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss和Prov-Decode三种干预措施。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark（ADB）上减少85%的对齐漂移，同时保持标准任务的性能。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐失败提供了可扩展、可追溯的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的研究在复杂危险特征识别上表现不佳，且训练成本高、泛化能力差，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出三个模块：检索库、图像相似性检索和大模型检索增强，通过提示微调结合外部知识，无需训练即可高效识别。

Result: 在真实工地数据上实验，GLM-4V的识别准确率提升至50%，提高了35.49%。

Conclusion: 该方法为危险检测提供了新的理论和实践支持，显著提升了准确性和上下文理解能力。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG框架通过结构化、激励对齐的合作，实现了可扩展且鲁棒的多智能体语言生成。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上实验表明，SE-Agent相对提升达55%，达到开源代理中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自我进化机制显著提升推理质量，为复杂任务解决提供了高效框架。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Motivation: 解决机器人系统无法直接基于手绘草图生成3D结构的问题，降低非专家的使用门槛。

Method: 引入抽象关系图，结合符号几何关系和稳定性模式，通过扩散模型生成3D姿态并迭代优化。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代房屋设计中，StackItUp生成的3D结构稳定且视觉相似度高，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家提供了一种简单有效的方式，通过草图生成复杂且稳定的3D结构。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方式——通过操纵工具元数据（如名称、描述等）来影响代理行为，称为“吸引性元数据攻击”（AMA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理依赖外部工具完成任务，但工具元数据的操纵未被充分研究，可能成为新的攻击面。

Method: 提出AMA攻击框架，通过迭代优化生成高吸引力且合法的工具元数据，无需修改代理执行框架。

Result: 在多种场景和LLM代理中，攻击成功率高达81%-95%，且对主任务影响极小。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击方式，需开发执行级安全机制以应对。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型推理模型（LRMs）的效率问题，尤其是过度推理现象，并综述了高效推理方法的研究进展，分为单模型优化和多模型协作两个方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型推理模型（如DeepSeek R1）的广泛应用，过度推理问题（如冗长的推理链）逐渐显现，影响了推理效率和准确性，因此需要研究高效推理方法。

Method: 通过系统综述现有研究，将高效推理方法分为两类：单模型优化（提升单个模型的推理效率）和多模型协作（通过模型间协作优化推理路径）。

Result: 总结了当前高效推理方法的研究进展，并维护了一个公开的GitHub仓库以跟踪最新动态。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的研究有助于解决LRMs的过度推理问题，提升模型性能，未来可进一步探索单模型和多模型协作的优化策略。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中对长上下文建模的需求增加，但标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为瓶颈，现有稀疏注意力机制存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和位置感知稀疏注意力计算，实现双稀疏设计，减少计算复杂度并保留关键信息。

Result: DMA在Chinchilla Scaling Law设置下优于多头注意力、滑动窗口注意力等方法，并在多查询关联召回任务中表现更优。1.7B参数模型评估中，DMA在标准基准和挑战性任务中显著优于多头注意力。

Conclusion: DMA有效平衡了模型效率和长上下文建模能力，为稀疏注意力机制提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于情感弧的游戏叙事生成框架，利用情感模式（上升与下降）指导分支故事图的生成，并通过原型ARPG验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将普遍的情感弧叙事结构应用于游戏叙事生成，以增强玩家的参与度和情感体验。

Method: 结合叙事学理论和实证分析，利用情感弧（Rise和Fall）生成分支故事图，并通过LLMs和自适应实体生成实现。

Result: 玩家评分、访谈和情感分析表明，情感弧的整合显著提升了游戏的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感冲击力。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的过程生成在提升互动叙事体验方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger

signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external
supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning
performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance
instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双惩罚强化学习框架，以减少大型推理模型（LRMs）中的冗余推理步骤，分为内部冗余和外部冗余，显著压缩推理痕迹且几乎不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）常因过度推理（overthinking）产生冗长的推理痕迹，影响效率和可解释性。现有方法仅关注减少响应长度，未深入分析推理过程的语义结构。

Method: 提出双惩罚强化学习框架：1）通过滑动窗口语义分析惩罚内部冗余（低贡献推理步骤）；2）惩罚外部冗余（在首次正确解后不必要的继续推理）。

Result: 方法显著压缩推理痕迹且准确性损失极小，能泛化至问答和代码生成等任务。外部冗余可安全移除，内部冗余需谨慎减少以避免影响正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升推理效率，还实现了对推理长度的语义感知控制，为更简洁、可解释的LRMs铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

Method: 提出三部分架构（感知、辅助、执行系统），结合多频神经振荡和突触动态适应机制。

Result: 在视觉任务中，性能优于现有方法，准确率提升2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，且更接近人类置信模式。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能提供了理论基础，可能缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Conclusion: 该方法将主动推理理论应用于实践，证明了认知先验在人工智能体中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Conclusion: OptiHive通过非迭代方法显著提升了LLM求解器的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链存在冗余问题，原因是训练过程过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含When、How和Which模块，动态干预推理路径，整合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架通过动态干预提升LLM推理的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的方法，用于新生儿MRI扫描中精确预测月经后年龄（PMA）并生成临床相关解释，解决了深度学习模型在临床决策支持中缺乏透明性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在预测PMA时虽准确但缺乏透明性，限制了其在临床决策中的应用。本文旨在同时实现高精度预测和可解释性。

Method: 采用参数高效微调（PEFT）策略，结合指令调优和低秩适应（LoRA），对Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型进行微调，使用四种2D皮质表面投影图进行训练。

Result: 模型预测误差的95%置信区间为0.78至1.52周，并能生成基于发育特征的可解释输出。

Conclusion: 该方法在提高预测精度的同时增强了透明性，为围产期神经科学中的可信AI系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

TL;DR: CAMA是一个两阶段因果框架，通过构建数学因果图（MCG）并动态提取任务相关子图，显著提升LLM在复杂数学推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种任务中表现优异，但在复杂数学推理上仍有困难，主要源于深层结构依赖。

Method: CAMA分学习阶段和推理阶段：学习阶段构建MCG并迭代优化；推理阶段动态提取任务相关子图指导LLM推理。

Result: 实验表明CAMA显著提升LLM在数学问题上的性能，结构化指导优于非结构化方法，非对称因果关系效果更佳。

Conclusion: CAMA通过显式数学结构增强LLM，为复杂数学推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Motivation: 当前AI代理在医疗研究中依赖静态策略，无法成为更好的战略规划者，限制了其在复杂领域的应用。

Method: 引入HealthFlow，通过元级进化机制自主优化高层问题解决策略，并开发EHRFlowBench基准进行可重复评估。

Result: 实验表明，HealthFlow的自我进化方法显著优于现有代理框架。

Conclusion: 该研究标志着从工具使用者转向更智能、自我进化的任务管理者，为更自主的AI科学发现铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 讨论了Noosemia的哲学、认识论和社会意义，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Motivation: 随着AI代理在电商中的普及，了解其购物行为及影响因素对平台设计、卖家策略和监管具有重要意义。

Method: 开发了ACES沙盒环境，结合VLM代理和可编程市场，通过随机化产品参数（如位置、价格、标签等）进行因果分析。

Result: AI代理对位置、赞助标签和平台推荐敏感，但对价格、评分的反应因模型而异；卖家代理通过优化描述可显著提升市场份额。

Conclusion: AI代理的购物行为揭示了电商生态中的新问题，为卖家策略、平台设计和监管提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于提供一种不依赖敏感或私有数据的方法，通过反事实解释帮助用户理解机器学习机制，并确保在高风险场景中的公平性。

Method: 方法包括使用贝叶斯网络估计数据密度，构建搜索空间，并应用路径规划算法生成反事实解释。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能有效捕捉变量间的交互作用，确保决策公平性，尤其在涉及社会人口学领域时，能避免对社区的负面影响。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

Motivation: 扩散策略在处理高维空间中的多模态动作分布时表现出色，但存在表示崩溃问题，导致对细微但关键的变化无法区分。

Method: 提出D2PPO，通过分散损失正则化处理隐藏表示，强制网络学习区分性表示。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，D2PPO平均提升22.7%（预训练）和26.1%（微调），并在真实机器人实验中表现出高成功率。

Conclusion: D2PPO通过分散损失正则化有效解决了表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

Motivation: 数据科学在AI中至关重要，但其结果难以复现，主要原因是数据科学生命周期中的不确定性。传统统计框架无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出更新的PCS框架，结合生成式AI，并通过案例展示其在数据清理阶段对预测不确定性的影响。

Result: 案例研究表明，数据清理阶段的判断会导致下游预测的不确定性。

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学提供了一种原则性方法，有助于减少不确定性并提高结果的可信度。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

Conclusion: 为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given
modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using
three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and
immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of
the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian

Conclusion: 该框架为结构工程师提供了高效、准确的预测工具，提升了设计安全性和决策效率。

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

Motivation: 随着对无缝互联网接入需求的增长，卫星连接在快速移动物体（如飞机、车辆或火车）中尤为重要。然而，频繁切换卫星信号可能导致连接问题，机器学习可预测信号质量以提前采取措施。

Method: 利用真实的地球静止轨道卫星与飞机通信数据集，通过机器学习算法分析历史数据并预测特定位置的网络质量。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提升了卫星连接的可靠性，还可扩展到其他移动物体（如车辆和火车），通过自动化切换机制进一步提高通信效率。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Conclusion: 需制定可重复性指南、加强研究者培训，并通过期刊和会议政策提升透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

Result: 开源预训练MVTS插补模型平均幻觉水平达弱基线的59.5%，缓解方法可降低47.7%。

Conclusion: 该定义和方法有助于提升MVTS基础模型的安全性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

Motivation: 现有方法通过投影松弛解决QAP问题时会引入数值尺度敏感性和几何不对齐误差，需要一种新的松弛框架来缓解这些问题。

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了现有松弛方法的误差问题，同时通过混合精度架构实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Conclusion: 自适应个性化风险检测方法对实时安全反馈和智能交通系统中的驾驶员支持具有重要价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Conclusion: 通过优化潜在边距选择模型变体，可显著提升检测器对后处理图像的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Motivation: 现有研究对Transformer如何存储和提取知识的理论理解不足，且多数研究局限于单层、仅注意力架构，忽略了MLP的作用。

Method: 引入了一个包含自注意力和MLP模块的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析其收敛性和泛化能力。

Result: 证明了Transformer在预训练中能有效获取知识，在满足条件时能成功提取知识，否则会出现幻觉现象。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并解释了学习率调度等经验现象。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained

training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k
steps), we identify universal neurons through pairwise correlation analysis of
activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD框架在时间序列异常检测中具有优越性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Result: 在数学、编程、医学和通用推理任务中，PALACE实现了低相对误差和高预测准确性。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，提升透明度和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准分类器和OOD检测器，有效提升了半监督学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

Motivation: 确保LLMs在临床实践中的安全性和可靠性，防止患者受到伤害，并推动AI在医疗领域的可信应用。

Method: 采用DAS红队测试框架，通过对抗性代理动态生成测试用例、识别不安全触发策略并评估响应，实时发现漏洞。

Result: 测试15个LLMs发现，静态基准表现与对抗压力下的脆弱性存在显著差异，多个安全领域（鲁棒性、隐私、偏见/公平性、幻觉）的失败率极高。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了可扩展、可靠的动态安全监测工具，弥补了静态测试的不足。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Conclusion: HHN通过有效建模时序依赖和跨模态交互，显著提升了复杂分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应版本的LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），用于量化特征重要性中的协同效应，并通过三个分数（唯一、冗余和协同）描述每个特征。该方法在空气质量与阿尔茨海默病死亡率的关系中展示了协同效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征重要性工具仅通过单一分数衡量特征相关性，无法捕捉高阶效应。本文旨在通过Hi-Fi方法揭示特征间的协同和冗余关系，提升可解释人工智能（XAI）的能力。

Method: 提出自适应LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），为每个特征分配三个分数（唯一、冗余、协同），并与Shapley效应进行比较。应用于空气质量与阿尔茨海默病死亡率的关系研究。

Result: 发现O3和NO2与死亡率存在协同效应，尤其在Bergamo和Brescia地区；城市绿地密度也与污染物协同影响死亡率预测。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi是一种广泛适用的工具，为XAI和复杂系统的高阶关系分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合海洋知识图谱和大语言模型（OKG-LLM）的新框架，用于全球海表温度（SST）预测，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在SST预测中忽视了领域知识，限制了预测精度的进一步提升。LLMs的潜力未被充分挖掘，尤其是如何整合海洋领域知识与数值数据。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），开发图嵌入网络学习其语义和结构知识，并与数值数据对齐融合，利用预训练LLM建模SST模式。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，OKG-LLM优于现有方法，证明了其有效性、鲁棒性和潜力。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，展示了领域知识与LLM结合的潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排名和自适应特征截断点选择，优化特征子集。

Result: 在14个公开数据集和1个行业数据集上，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持性能；与PSO结合时，进一步减少25%的特征和66%的计算时间。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts是一种高效、可扩展的特征选择方法，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在通用嵌入任务中表现出潜力，但其生成式特性难以适应判别式表示学习，且现有的大规模对比预训练方法存在计算成本高和未充分利用MLLMs指令跟随能力的问题。

Method: 提出分层嵌入提示模板（两层级指令架构）和自感知硬负采样（利用模型自身理解高效挖掘困难负样本并过滤假负样本）。

Result: 分层提示在零样本任务中表现与对比训练基线相当，并通过自感知硬负采样在MMEB基准上提升4.8分，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLMs在通用嵌入任务中的应用提供了高效且有效的途径，显著减少了训练时间。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Motivation: 现有方法在异构数据融合中存在统一表示框架缺失、存储与扩展性问题以及跨任务泛化能力不足的局限性。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 因果Q-Former将领域特征映射到共享因果表示空间；2) 多视图RQ-VAE通过共享和特定源码书将嵌入离散化为紧凑令牌。

Result: 实验显示U^2QT在行为预测和推荐任务中优于基线方法，同时在存储和计算效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: U^2QT的统一令牌化框架支持与语言模型的无缝集成，适用于工业级应用。

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

Motivation: 解决零样本文本分类在知识不断演变和类别边界模糊的领域（如票务系统）中的困难，传统方法因主题可分离性有限或数据多样性不足而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该框架通过基于提示的语义推理，在有限监督下实现了细粒度分类的高效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Motivation: PGNNIV模型在处理高维数据时面临可扩展性挑战，需要更高效的方法来提升性能。

Method: 引入基于谱分解、POD和预训练自编码器的替代解码器结构，并结合迁移学习和微调策略。

Result: 改进后的框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并减少了计算需求。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可根据不同场景定制，有效解决了PGNNIV的可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Method: 引入FinKario数据集（包含30多万实体和近万关系），并通过FinKario-RAG两阶段图检索策略优化金融知识检索。

Result: 实验表明，FinKario结合FinKario-RAG在股票趋势预测中表现优异，平均超越金融LLMs和机构策略18.81%和17.85%。

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识动态更新和非结构化问题，显著提升了LLMs的金融分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，多模态设计的核心在于特征域的内在互补性，而非数量，并提出了量化互补性的理论框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Conclusion: VAULT通过自动化对抗数据生成和训练，显著提升了NLI模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to

Motivation: 组织病理学数据不足以全面表征分子特征和临床结果，而多组学数据（如转录组、甲基化组、基因组）包含重要信息。MORPHEUS旨在统一这些数据，提升表征能力。

Method: MORPHEUS采用掩码建模目标，随机选择组学部分进行训练，学习跨模态关系。框架支持单独使用组织病理学或结合任意组学子集。

Result: 在大型泛癌队列上预训练后，MORPHEUS在多种模态组合和任务中优于现有方法，并能实现任意组学生成。

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是一个有前景的多模态基础模型框架，适用于肿瘤学研究。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

TL;DR: v-PuNNs是一种新型神经网络架构，利用p-adic数表示层次结构数据，通过TURL原则和VAPO优化方法，在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在欧几里得空间中表示层次结构数据效果不佳，需要一种更精确、可解释的模型。

Method: 提出v-PuNNs架构，神经元为p-adic球的特征函数，采用TURL原则和VAPO优化方法（包括HiPaN-DS和Adam-VAPO）。

Result: 在WordNet、GO和NCBI Mammalia等基准测试中取得高精度和高效性能，学习到的度量具有完美超度量性质。

Conclusion: v-PuNNs将数论与深度学习结合，为层次结构数据提供精确、可解释且高效的模型。

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Conclusion: MA-PROPS通过减少联合采样误差，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Conclusion: FGBench的方法论为构建功能组级数据集提供了基础框架，有望推动大语言模型在分子结构-属性关系中的理解与应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Result: 在多个复杂动态系统（如WeatherBench数据集）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维动态系统的概率预测提供了数学基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Result: 离线分析显示BUS显著优于传统方法，线上测试在音乐排名和邮件通知等指标上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: BUS是首个在大规模工业场景中有效整合多样用户属性并保持语义可解释性的列表学习排序框架。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Conclusion: Transformer-based PRNGs具有潜力，能够生成高质量随机数，并通过实验验证了其理论可行性。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Result: 实验表明，DisTaC能显著提升现有合并方法在问题场景中的性能。

Conclusion: DisTaC有效解决了模型合并中的关键问题，为多任务学习提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习的主要挑战在于平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能获取，现有方法通常孤立处理这些问题，忽略了它们的内在关联。

Method: T2S通过将模型参数标记化，将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记之间的交叉注意力，并通过语言引导技能扩展实现跨任务知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，T2S在防止灾难性遗忘（平均NBT为1.0%）、新技能扩展（仅需8.0%可训练标记）和跨任务知识迁移（平均FWT为77.7%）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习模型难以适应动态变化的市场条件，无法有效平衡风险与收益。

Method: MARS采用异构智能体集合，每个智能体具有独特的风险特征，并由Meta-Adaptive Controller动态协调。

Result: 实验表明，MARS显著降低了最大回撤和波动率，同时保持了竞争力收益。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性而非显式市场特征工程，实现了风险与收益的优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的后训练优化采用风险中性目标，但评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RSPO方法，通过利用闭式概率解决低奖励响应被无意强化的问题，并设计高效、无偏的梯度估计器。

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，RSPO有效优化了Pass@k和Max@k指标。

Conclusion: RSPO成功填补了训练目标与评估指标之间的风险偏好差距，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and

*Shiko Kudo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于正弦波的周期性激活函数PLU，通过创新的Repulsive Reparameterization技术，显著提升了神经网络的表达能力和参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络依赖单调激活函数（如ReLU），导致需要大规模参数化模型来逼近复杂函数。PLU旨在通过周期性非单调性提升表达能力和效率。

Method: 提出Periodic Linear Unit (PLU)，一种基于正弦波的可学习激活函数，并结合Repulsive Reparameterization技术防止其退化为线性函数。

Result: 实验表明，仅含两个PLU神经元的MLP即可解决螺旋分类任务，而传统激活函数无法实现。

Conclusion: PLU标志着从分段泰勒近似到傅里叶式函数合成的范式转变，显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实图中的特征缺失问题导致GNN性能下降，现有方法在特征稀少时表现不佳。

Method: GOODIE通过标签传播和特征传播分支结合，利用结构-特征注意力和伪标签对比学习优化预测。

Result: GOODIE在特征稀少和丰富情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE有效解决了特征缺失问题，提升了图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code

Conclusion: 为跨科学领域的通用数据高效算子学习提供新基础。

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了时空数据的插值可靠性和可视化效果，为决策提供了更可靠的支持。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦无监督学习中难以实现全局均匀性，主要由于非独立同分布数据和去中心化特性。

Method: 提出SSD方法，通过软分离和蒸馏模块，减少客户端模型聚合时的干扰，并引入投影蒸馏模块优化表征质量。

Result: 在跨设备和跨场景的联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表征质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD有效解决了FUL中的全局均匀性问题，为联邦学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

TL;DR: 研究发现，在满足特定条件下，仅通过贪婪目标训练的元强化学习代理也能表现出探索行为，无需显式探索激励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，传统方法依赖显式探索激励，本研究探讨是否可以通过贪婪目标自然产生探索行为。

Method: 提出三个条件：重复环境结构、代理记忆和长时程信用分配，通过实验验证这些条件对探索行为的影响。

Result: 在满足结构和记忆条件时，贪婪目标训练的代理表现出探索行为；去除任一条件会消除探索行为。长时程信用分配的缺失不一定阻止探索。

Conclusion: 探索行为可以在满足特定条件下自然涌现，无需显式探索激励，表明探索与利用可以统一于奖励最大化过程。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，FedCD优于五种FL方法。

Conclusion: FedCD有效解决了隐私保护和公平诊断问题，为智能教育平台提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估，还为全球灾害风险减少提供了新工具，同时为弱监督下的城市研究提供了概率深度学习框架。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Method: 研究比较了标准PINN和反向兼容PINN（BC-PINN）的训练方法，并通过放松物理约束和动态调整损失函数权重优化性能。

Result: PINN模型在2D层流和3D湍流中均能有效学习物理规律并准确重建流场。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据下具有潜力，为实际工程应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KFCV方法计算量大且可能导致泛化评估不足，而SRS在数据不平衡时表现不佳。FSV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FSV结合了SRS和KFCV，引入加权因子优化分区，并在三个数据集上进行了测试。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE等指标上均优于SRS和KFCV，表现出更高的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: FSV为资源受限环境和大数据集提供了高效的数据分区解决方案。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，训练策略时状态和动作分布的变化可能导致性能次优甚至崩溃。即使改进探索算法或奖励目标，优化困难可能阻碍这些改进的效果。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，通过实验评估不同环境和RL算法的优化限制。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的最佳经验比学习性能高出2-3倍，表明深度RL方法仅利用了生成的好经验的一半。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习算法在优化方面存在显著限制，仅能部分利用生成的高质量经验。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Conclusion: 为LoRA-based FL的聚合策略提供了理论依据，SP和PS均有效但各有优劣。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法为数值积分提供了一种高效且理论保证的解决方案，尤其适用于非奇异相互作用核和Coulomb相互作用核。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有容量分析未考虑实际机器学习中特征相关的数据，需填补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 通过信息论中的汉明距离构建不同特征相关性和模式分离的数据集，使用二分搜索算法计算存储容量。

Result: 内存容量随输入空间分离度指数增长，特征相关性略微降低容量，高次能量函数中影响更显著。

Conclusion: DAM在描述高阶特征交互时受限，研究为理论与实践的桥梁，可能启发更多数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Method: 开发了四种机器学习模型（线性回归、随机森林、XGBoost和LSTM），分别在不包含和包含流动性代理指标（VVR和VWAP）的情况下进行训练和评估。

Result: LSTM模型在两种情况下均表现最佳，表明流动性指标能显著提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: 流动性指标对加密货币价格预测至关重要，建议将其纳入模型以提高预测精度，为交易者和开发者提供更智能的策略。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Method: 提出UniExtreme模型，包含自适应频率调制模块（AFM）和事件先验增强模块（EPA），分别处理光谱差异和极端事件多样性。

Result: 实验表明，UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniExtreme模型为极端天气预测提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Result: 在32个基准数据集上表现优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预设阈值，能更准确地识别和增强少数样本，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Result: 在相同时间限制下，CASP系统能解决26%至86%更多的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了延迟，使CASP系统更适用于高通量合成筛选和提升用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记有效解决了Transformer在序列分类任务中的局限性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet具有优秀的泛化能力，适合实际分类任务，未来将探索更多混沌映射。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Result: 发现冷却形状和AdamW超参数（如β2）对性能有显著影响，平衡探索与开发的形状表现最优。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对Transformer训练至关重要，需与传统超参数调优结合。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自然语言指令的时间序列编辑方法InstructTime，解决了现有扩散编辑器的局限性，实现了灵活可控的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散编辑器依赖预定义属性向量，缺乏灵活性和可控性，无法满足用户多样化需求。

Method: 引入基于指令的时间序列编辑，通过多模态表示空间嵌入时间和指令，解码生成编辑后的时间序列，并使用多分辨率编码器处理局部和全局编辑。

Result: InstructTime在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，实现了高质量、可控强度的编辑，并能泛化到未见指令和条件。

Conclusion: InstructTime是一种先进的时间序列编辑器，具有灵活性和可控性，适用于多样化编辑需求。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩技术虽能减少模型参数，但忽略了推理时的激活内存开销，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过融合低秩投影核到自注意力和前馈网络管道中，避免生成完整激活缓冲区，动态加载和计算小分块。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD减少峰值激活内存70.2%，中间临时内存75%，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为低秩LLMs在内存受限环境中的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列通常具有强周期性结构，但现代深度学习模型因频谱偏差和缺乏频率感知的归纳先验而难以捕捉这些模式。

Method: 通过快速傅里叶变换（FFT）提取低频分量，初始化正弦嵌入，并采用双速学习计划以保留频率结构。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种真实数据集上显著提升了长期预测性能，并在合成数据中准确恢复了真实频率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过注入频谱先验，为深度学习模型提供了鲁棒且可解释的长期预测能力。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke

TL;DR: SimDeep是一种新型联邦学习框架，旨在解决室内定位中的非独立同分布数据和设备异构性问题，通过相似性聚合策略显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内定位在复杂环境中支持多种基于位置的服务，但非独立同分布数据和设备异构性限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出SimDeep框架，采用相似性聚合策略，基于数据相似性聚合客户端模型更新。

Result: 实验表明，SimDeep准确率达到92.89%，优于传统联邦和集中式方法。

Conclusion: SimDeep在解决实际部署挑战方面表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究刚性系统中参数梯度消失的问题，以解决神经微分方程优化中的困难。

Method: 通过分析刚性数值积分方案的稳定性函数及其导数，推导参数敏感性的衰减规律。

Result: 证明了所有A-稳定时间步进方法在刚性区域都会抑制参数梯度，衰减速率最慢为$O(|z|^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 刚性系统中的梯度消失是普遍现象，对神经ODE的训练和参数识别构成重大障碍。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨原型模型是否能在分类任务之外捕捉与临床表型相关的结构。

Method: 使用原型深度学习模型对PTB-XL数据集进行多标签ECG分类，并在MIMIC-IV数据库上进行推断，评估原型与医院出院诊断的关联。

Result: 原型与临床结果的关联性显著强于分类器预测或NLP提取的概念，且在非心脏疾病中也表现良好。

Conclusion: 原型模型支持从生理时间序列数据中进行可解释的数字表型分析，捕捉超出原始训练目标的临床相关特征。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESPP问题在存在负权环时是NP难问题，传统方法难以高效求解，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 使用无监督图神经网络联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，通过替代损失函数减少负权环并嵌入算法对齐。

Result: 在100节点以内的图上，该方法优于无监督基线和经典启发式算法，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESPP问题提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

Result: KANMixer在7个基准数据集的16/28实验中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: KAN的自适应灵活性显著改变了网络结构先验对预测性能的影响，并提供了有效利用KAN的实践指南。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Method: 动态聚类算法结合模型差异度量，基于训练损失曲线调整分组结构，采用分层聚合机制减少通信成本。

Result: 实验表明DC-PFL显著减少训练时间并提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL有效应对数据异构性，优化联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Conclusion: 本文为去噪分数匹配损失提供了理论支持，并展示了启发式加权函数的实际优势，有助于更稳定和高效的训练。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态协作和专家级可塑性，有效解决了多数据流学习中的挑战。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中因数据质量差或错误动作导致的决策问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验表明，结合人类反馈显著提升了模型在复杂环境中的决策能力，特别是在文档识别和信息提取任务中。

Conclusion: ARL框架结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的性能提升方法。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Motivation: 大规模高质量EHR数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理多模态数据和数据缺失问题，尤其在传统中医（TCM）领域。

Method: 提出TCDiff框架，包含三重扩散网络（参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接、目标模态扩散），用于生成高保真EHR数据。

Result: TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有方法10%，同时保持隐私性，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TCDiff为EHR数据生成提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案，适用于实际医疗场景。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无需保留集的方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的机器遗忘方法，显著提升遗忘效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出USRFNet，一种深度学习网络，用于解决微服务架构中性能监控和资源管理的挑战，通过分离和建模流量侧与资源侧特征，显著提升了P95尾延迟预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，传统方法依赖的延迟指标对瞬时噪声敏感且无法全面反映复杂并发工作负载的行为。

Method: 提出USRFNet，利用GNN捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和整合流量侧与资源侧特征，为微服务架构提供了更准确的性能监控和资源管理解决方案。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种细粒度、分层的量化方案，支持1位权重全连接层，并通过多输入查找表协议高效安全地评估softmax，显著降低了安全多方计算中的通信和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式机器学习模型在隐私敏感领域（如医疗和个性化服务）的部署，安全推理成为关键挑战。现有方法存在隐私风险或效率低下问题。

Method: 提出细粒度分层量化方案，支持1位权重全连接层；设计多输入查找表协议高效评估softmax；使用双秘密共享方案和查找表进行精度转换。

Result: 在BERT-base模型上，相比现有方法实现了8倍、9倍和22倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了安全推理的效率，同时避免了隐私风险。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Result: 在DVS-Gesture上达到98.78%的准确率，CIFAR10-DVS和CIFAR-10上分别为83.06%和95.3%。

Conclusion: 利用脉冲时序动态可同时提升计算效率和精度。

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构性导致的泛化性能低问题，特别是在客户端模型架构异构的场景下。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在泛化准确性上优于现有模型异构联邦学习框架，同时通信成本和内存消耗更低。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了模型异构联邦学习中的泛化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

Method: 引入陈旧性感知聚合和动态学习率调度，分析客户端选择策略对收敛的影响，并在PyTorch和asyncio中实现。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在异步、异构和非凸FL场景中的性能和可扩展性提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了AFL中的非凸性和异构性问题，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自归一化浓度不等式无法提供紧致的遗憾保证，因此需要新的理论工具。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并设计了一种新的自归一化Bernstein-like不等式。

Result: 遗憾界为$\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$，与现有最优结果一致。

Conclusion: GKB-UCB算法统一了核化赌博机和广义线性赌博机的视角。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合标记化方法，将表格数据转换为适合LLM的统一序列格式，并在大规模网络流数据集上验证了其高效性和压缩能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中表格数据的表示问题，特别是为序列架构（如Transformers和LLMs）适应结构化数据提供统一方法。

Method: 结合预定义固定标记表示结构元素和低基数分类特征，使用BPE学习高基数和连续值的子词词汇。

Result: 方法高效，处理3100万网络流数据用时不到5小时，压缩比为6.18:1，生成10亿标记的语料库。

Conclusion: 为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

TL;DR: PHAR是一个将时间序列分类模型的数值特征归因转化为结构化、可读规则的后处理框架，提升模型透明度和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类模型的解释性差，难以理解原始时间序列和高维输入空间。

Method: PHAR将LIME、SHAP等后处理解释器的数值特征归因转化为可读规则，并通过规则融合步骤优化覆盖、置信度和简洁性。

Result: PHAR在UCI数据集上表现优异，提升了时间序列分类任务的解释性、决策透明度和实用性。

Conclusion: PHAR通过规则融合和可视化技术，解决了时间序列分类模型解释中的冲突和重叠问题，提供一致且可适应的解释。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Motivation: 解决随机最优控制问题，尤其是二阶HJB方程的求解，传统方法在复杂或高维场景中效率较低。

Method: 在每次迭代中，通过训练神经网络逼近值函数，最小化固定策略诱导的线性PDE残差，并利用L2误差控制和Lipschitz型边界量化误差传播。

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架扩展了确定性方法到随机场景，继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性，为训练中的策略质量评估提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，CcGAN-AVAR实现了最高生成质量，同时推理速度提升300-2000倍。

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR在生成质量和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于高分辨率数据生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过去除冗余参数和语义噪声，OccamVTS显著提升预测准确性，验证了轻量化设计的有效性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升了现有LLM推理集群的能效和经济效益，且不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种可训练的优化器框架，通过联合训练梯度估计器和模型权重，替代传统手动定义的优化策略（如ADAM）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化策略（如ADAM）依赖手动定义的梯度估计，限制了优化效率和适应性。

Method: 提出Pseudo-linear TO（可训练优化器），通过线性近似全梯度匹配SGD收敛速度，并降低方差。还引入两种简化变体以提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，TO方法在强凸和非凸场景下均比基准算法（如ADAM）收敛更快，并在LLM微调中表现优异。

Conclusion: 可训练优化器框架在计算效率和收敛速度上优于传统方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VAGPO的新方法，结合视觉编码和Transformer模型，用于解决TSP和CVRP等路由问题，具有高效训练和强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法在训练效率和泛化能力上存在不足，尤其是面对大规模实例时。

Method: 采用ResNet视觉编码和Transformer序列建模，结合非对称组偏好优化策略。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP基准测试中表现优异，无需重新训练即可泛化至1000节点规模。

Conclusion: VAGPO在学习和扩展性方面均表现出色，为路由问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了异步去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中客户端持续退出的问题，提出基于客户端重构的自适应策略以恢复性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异步和去中心化导致联邦学习中对模型更新的信息模糊，客户端退出时难以恢复，现有方法效果有限。

Method: 引入基于客户端重构的自适应策略，结合本地正则化，评估了三种DFL算法和三种数据异构场景。

Result: 实验表明，自适应策略能有效恢复部分性能损失，提升联邦学习的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 策略虽不能精确重构缺失客户端数据，但能有效应对退出问题，未来需进一步研究。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Conclusion: 通过最优控制和多步优化，方法实现了鲁棒性和泛化性，适用于时间序列分析。

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: TD2C在未见过的动态和真实基准测试中表现优异，尤其在非线性和高维场景下。

Conclusion: TD2C为复杂系统中的因果发现提供了鲁棒且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拉格朗日方法可能导致振荡和超调，因此需要一种更稳定的约束优化方法。

Method: PCPO结合了预惩罚机制（通过边界附近添加障碍项）和约束感知内在奖励，采用策略迭代优化。

Result: 理论分析表明PCPO具有收敛性，实验显示其稳定性显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PCPO为约束下的策略优化提供了稳健解决方案，对研究和应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要从头开始训练，效率低下且资源浪费。持续预训练是一种更高效的方法，但新数据引入会导致分布偏移和性能下降。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构家族中进行了大规模多语言持续预训练（每种语言1000亿标记数据）。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中证明有效，并提出了一种高效的元经验回放（MER）实现。

Conclusion: 小比例回放旧数据比增加模型规模更高效，但增加模型规模比高比例回放更计算高效。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

Motivation: 探索语言模型内部表征修改对生成内容的控制条件，填补现有研究中干预效果不明确且依赖试错的空白。

Method: 提出统一框架“干预检测器”（ID），通过隐藏状态和表征分析揭示线性可操纵性在训练中的动态演变。

Result: 发现概念在隐藏空间中线性可分性与线性可操纵性密切相关，且不同模型家族中结果具有普适性。

Conclusion: 线性可操纵性在训练中动态演变，ID框架为理解和优化模型控制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验证明子空间与GPT-2中的电路变量有强关联。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部和构建电路提供了新视角，并展示了在大型模型中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Conclusion: 迭代框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，提升了GNN解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Conclusion: DB-RPNI是一种高效且统一的自动机学习方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus

TL;DR: OptiGridML是一个用于电网离散拓扑优化的机器学习框架，通过两阶段神经网络架构替代传统混合整数规划求解，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电网中混合整数规划（MIP）因NP-hard特性在大规模网络中计算不可行的问题。

Method: 采用线图神经网络（LGNN）近似直流潮流，异构GNN（HeteroGNN）预测断路器状态，并通过物理一致性损失确保基尔霍夫定律。

Result: 在1000个断路器的合成网络中，功率输出提升18%，推理时间从小时级降至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 结构化、流感知的GNN在物理网络系统的组合优化中具有加速潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于潜在变量模型的主动特征获取方法，解决了现有方法训练困难或短视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法存在训练困难或短视的缺陷，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 引入了一种监督训练的潜在变量模型，通过随机潜在空间中的多可能未观测特征进行推理。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上广泛评估，表明该方法优于多种基线。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在变量模型有效解决了主动特征获取中的问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文任务时，由于键值（KV）缓存的增长，面临效率挑战。

Method: LeanK利用静态通道稀疏性，通过两阶段训练过程学习通道级静态掩码，满足特定稀疏率和硬件对齐要求。

Result: 实验显示，LeanK可减少70%的K缓存和16%-18%的V缓存内存，注意力计算速度提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: LeanK在不牺牲准确性的情况下优化了LLM的效率，并提供了对模型通道和注意力头的深入分析。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA是一种两阶段适配器，通过Kronecker乘积和低秩分解实现参数高效和高表达性，性能接近标准LoRA适配器，但参数更少且量化友好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务微调中需要参数高效且高表达性的适配器的问题。

Method: 采用Kronecker乘积分解线性更新，再通过低秩LoRA分解压缩，减少参数并保持表达性。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA性能接近标准LoRA适配器，参数更少且量化效果更好。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA为多任务适应提供了可扩展、可持续且支持持续学习的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟细胞建模是AI与生物学的交叉领域，但自主构建模型面临生物系统复杂性、数据异质性和跨学科专业知识的挑战。

Method: CellForge利用多代理框架，包括任务分析、方法设计和实验执行模块，通过代理协作生成优化模型和代码。

Result: 在单细胞扰动预测任务中，CellForge在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellForge展示了多代理协作在解决复杂建模问题中的优势。

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大型语言模型（LLM）推理过程中，通过中间步骤的奖励模型（PRMs）提前筛选次优候选方案，以减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PRMs方法虽然有效，但在并行生成大量解决方案时计算开销巨大，因此研究是否能在生成过程中提前利用PRMs信号以提升效率。

Method: 提出PRMs可作为部分奖励模型（Partial Reward Models），通过中间步骤的分数预测最终输出质量，实现基于中间信号的早期筛选。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，部分奖励与最终奖励强相关，数学推理基准测试中推理FLOPs减少1.4-9倍且性能不降。

Conclusion: 早期筛选是提升LLM推理计算效率的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构化数据和非结构化临床笔记的两阶段框架，用于临床风险预测，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用电子健康记录（EHRs）中的多模态数据（结构化数据和非结构化临床笔记）进行临床结果预测，以支持早期干预和资源分配。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段通过微调的大型语言模型（LLM）从临床笔记中提取关键信息，并结合图检索外部医学知识；第二阶段结合结构化数据和非结构化表示生成最终预测。

Result: 在30天再入院和院内死亡率预测任务中，AUC分别达到0.84和0.92，优于现有基线方法和临床实践。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM和图检索方法，显著提升了临床预测的准确性，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

TL;DR: CAPO方法通过生成式过程奖励模型（LLM-as-GenPRM）提供细粒度奖励分配，显著提升了强化学习模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对整段响应赋予相同奖励，导致信用分配不精确，影响学习效率和策略优化。

Method: CAPO利用通用LLM作为生成式过程奖励模型，一步生成逐步评判，实现细粒度奖励分配。

Result: CAPO在多个数学基准和跨领域基准上优于监督学习和强化学习方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度奖励分配和投票机制，有效提升了模型的推理能力和学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAFNet是一种基于CPA的紧凑架构，用于处理不规则多元时间序列（IMTS），通过预卷积、时间核聚合和频率线性注意力模块，显著提升了预测性能并降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS建模中广泛使用的CPA方法因零填充导致计算开销大，而现有的图模型虽避免了CPA但难以捕捉全局相关性，因此需要一种既能保留CPA优势又能高效处理的方法。

Method: 提出KAFNet，结合预卷积模块（平滑序列和稀疏缓解）、时间核聚合模块（可学习压缩和建模序列不规则性）和频率线性注意力模块（低成本建模频域相关性）。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet实现了最先进的预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练-推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet通过优化CPA处理方式，证明了CPA在IMTS建模中的有效性，同时显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have

consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Conclusion: 混合系统能够有效结合LLM的战略推理和RL的执行能力，提升算法交易的表现。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现代推荐系统比之前认为的更脆弱，亟需更强大的防御机制。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

Conclusion: 验证了剪枝和补偿策略在构建高效高性能脉冲Transformer模型中的有效性。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and

generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类专家意见不一致的领域中，评估LLMs输出的可靠性具有挑战性。

Method: 分析5,680个编码决策，结合模型自信度（Pearson r=0.82）和多样性（归一化香农熵），构建双信号模型（R^2=0.979）。

Result: 双信号模型自动接受35%的片段（错误率<5%），减少人工工作量65%，跨领域验证显示kappa提升0.20-0.78。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可推广的、基于证据的AI判断校准标准，适用于定性研究。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Method: 提出模型回收框架，高效选择和重用相关源模型，支持白盒和黑盒设置。

Result: 框架使模型即服务（MaaS）提供商能够构建高效的预训练模型库，支持多源无监督迁移学习。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了源数据不可用时的迁移学习挑战，为模型重用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer注意力机制提供了新的理解，并为架构设计和注意力汇聚现象的关系提供了洞见。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning

when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Conclusion: Epi$^^2$-Net为未来流行病防控提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) 是一个框架，用于在微调大语言模型时保持对齐性，通过正则化和任务特定组件减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 微调可能导致对齐漂移，削弱模型的安全性和行为约束，因此需要一种方法来保持对齐性。

Method: AGL 结合了主任务损失、Fisher 信息矩阵正则化、任务特定正则化和碰撞感知正则化（Riemannian 重叠和测地分离）。

Result: AGL 在安全关键基准测试中将对齐漂移减少高达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是一种结构化的 LoRA 改进方法，能有效保持对齐性，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Conclusion: 为激活稀疏开辟新方向，指导下一代AI系统的算法与架构协同设计。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of

### [569] [FedLAD: A Linear Algebra Based Data Poisoning Defence for Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02136)
*Qi Xiong,Hai Dong,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedLAD的新型防御方法，用于对抗联邦学习中的Sybil攻击（特别是目标数据投毒攻击），通过线性代数优化检测恶意节点，实验证明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成重大威胁，恶意节点可能通过协作占据多数，破坏系统安全性，因此需要开发有效的防御措施。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性问题，转化为线性代数优化挑战，通过提取独立的线性组合来识别和过滤恶意节点。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在恶意节点比例为0.2至0.8时保持低攻击成功率，在0.2至0.5时保持高模型精度，优于五种基准防御方法。

Conclusion: FedLAD能有效提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: AuroBind是一种可扩展的虚拟筛选框架，通过原子级结构模型和大规模化学基因组数据优化，显著提升药物发现效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超过96%的人类蛋白质未被现有药物开发，现有虚拟筛选方法缺乏原子级精度和结合适应性预测能力。

Method: AuroBind结合直接偏好优化、自蒸馏技术和师生加速策略，预测配体结合结构和结合适应性。

Result: AuroBind在结构和功能基准测试中优于现有模型，筛选速度提升10万倍，实验命中率达7-69%。

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与药物发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的鲁棒语义通信框架（RKD-SC），通过轻量级架构搜索和两阶段知识蒸馏，实现了高效且抗信道噪声的语义通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型（LSM）在语义通信中具有潜力，但高计算复杂度和资源需求限制了其直接部署。

Method: 结合知识蒸馏的轻量级架构搜索（KDL-DARTS）和两阶段鲁棒知识蒸馏（RKD），并引入信道感知变换器（CAT）块。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，RKD-SC显著减少了模型参数，同时保持了高性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效且鲁棒的语义通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Conclusion: ACPOMDPs和特权信息引导的方法在安全强化学习中具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLP、MSCNN和CA的轨迹预测模型，显著降低了预测误差，同时保持推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹预测对制定主动策略至关重要，但数据包含全局和局部时间信息，且用户行为具有多尺度性，增加了模式提取的难度。

Method: 结合MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，并通过CA融合两者。

Result: 在12步预测中，MSE降低5.04%，MAE降低4.35%，推理时间相近。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了轨迹预测中的多尺度时间信息提取问题，提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Motivation: 现有因果方法主要处理二元/离散处理，难以应对连续多维设置，且金融领域要求处理与结果关系单调。

Method: 提出Multi-Treatment-DML框架，利用双机器学习（DML）去偏观测数据、处理连续多维处理，并强制单调约束。

Result: 在公共基准和真实工业数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并通过在线A/B测试证实其在实际贷款操作中的优越性。

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML为连续多维处理的因果估计提供了有效解决方案，并满足金融领域的单调性要求。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Result: 在三个问答基准测试中平均提升2.8%，并在跨任务泛化中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、高效且模型无关，展示了上下文感知解码在提升LLM事实可靠性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Conclusion: 网络化LLM系统通过聚合小型专业化模型的输出，能够有效平衡信息准确性和响应时效性，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Motivation: 传统多策略方法依赖在线强化学习和进化框架，导致样本效率低和交互成本高，MPFT框架旨在解决这些问题。

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务中，MPFT表现出优于现有方法的超体积性能，同时减少交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架为多目标强化学习提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

Motivation: 解决传统分割学习（SL）在恶意客户端攻击下模型准确性下降的问题。

Method: 将客户端分为N+1个集群，独立训练并评估验证损失，仅保留损失最低的集群；Pigeon-SL+进一步优化训练效率。

Result: 在标签翻转、激活和梯度操作等攻击模型下，显著提高了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效且安全的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner是一种高效且灵活的剪枝方法，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可促进航空分析能力，但需对预战术预测准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

*Parth Naik,Harikrishnan N B*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新从动力系统和压缩的角度解读分类问题，探索学习理论和信息处理的基础视角。

Method: 使用混沌映射生成符号序列，计算类别的转移概率，测试时通过动态重建技术选择最短压缩表示。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现良好（如乳腺癌威斯康星数据集F1分数0.9531）。

Conclusion: 该方法为分类问题提供了新的动力系统和压缩视角，虽非最优但具有理论意义。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

TL;DR: BOOST框架自动化选择贝叶斯优化的核函数和采集函数，通过离线评估阶段预测性能，显著提升优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化的性能高度依赖核函数和采集函数的选择，不当组合会导致性能下降和资源浪费，目前缺乏自动化选择方法。

Method: BOOST通过离线评估阶段，将数据分为参考子集和查询子集，评估不同核函数-采集函数组合的性能，选择最优配置。

Result: 实验表明，BOOST在合成基准函数和实际超参数优化任务中均优于固定超参数的标准贝叶斯优化方法。

Conclusion: BOOST是一种简单有效的自动化选择框架，显著提升了贝叶斯优化的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Motivation: 量化词嵌入中的不确定性对文本数据的可靠推断至关重要，但现有贝叶斯方法（如HMC和MFVI）要么计算不可行，要么依赖限制性假设。

Method: 提出了一种可扩展的Gibbs采样器，使用Polya-Gamma增强和拉普拉斯近似，并与MFVI和HMC进行比较。同时解决了词嵌入中的非可识别性问题。

Result: Gibbs采样器和HMC能正确估计不确定性，MFVI不能，拉普拉斯近似仅在大样本下有效。后验均值在保留似然性上优于MAP估计，尤其是小样本时。

Conclusion: 后验采样对词嵌入的重要性得到验证，尤其是在小样本情况下，Gibbs采样器在真实大数据集上表现出可行性。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroMix是一种混合精度量化算法和矩阵乘法内核，专为Blackwell架构设计，支持MXFP4、MXFP6和MXFP8通道组合，提升LLM推理速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INT4内核无法充分利用NVIDIA Blackwell架构的FP4 Tensor Cores性能，需解决数据格式不匹配问题。

Method: 提出MicroMix算法，结合MX数据格式和量化阈值，动态分配不同精度通道以平衡准确性和效率。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，比TensorRT-FP8快20%，并提升预填充延迟和内存效率。

Conclusion: MicroMix在Blackwell架构上实现了高效且准确的LLM推理，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

Motivation: GW和FGW距离在比较异构数据时非常有用，但其计算复杂且非凸，现有切片方法局限于欧几里得几何且失去等距不变性。

Method: 基于适当的下界、分层最优传输和合适的1D OT问题积分规则，提出新的切片技术。

Result: 新方法显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何形状，并在形状检索和图同构测试中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 新切片距离在计算效率和性能上优于原始GW和FGW距离，适用于更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Motivation: 现有非均匀剪枝方法依赖人工设计策略，无法适应动态剪枝需求且评估耗时。

Method: PPF利用轻量级性能预测器和自适应代理，实现实时剪枝决策与快速策略评估。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF将困惑度降低33.4%（动态）和84.78%（静态），预测误差<0.0011，评估延迟从分钟级降至秒级。

Conclusion: PPF解决了动态剪枝和策略评估的瓶颈，显著优于人工设计策略。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Motivation: 传统频谱嵌入方法在捕捉潜在结构特征时表现力有限，无法充分利用变换域的信息。

Method: 利用图分数傅里叶变换扩展GEFFE方法，结合分数域滤波和非线性特征组合，动态确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上验证了GEFRFE能捕获更丰富的结构特征并显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: GEFRFE在保持计算复杂度与GEFFE相当的同时，显著提升了嵌入空间的表现力。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Result: 实验证明ASMR在图像分类任务中有效检测异常客户端，并展示动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR为联邦学习提供了一种无需先验知识的实用防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Conclusion: ML分类器可作为轻量级、任务相关的质量评估工具，提升医学形状建模的透明度和临床适用性。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，可以有效减少标签噪声并提升医学图像分析的性能。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve

*Shunxian Gu,Chaoqun You,Bangbang Ren,Deke Guo*

TL;DR: SplitMe框架通过互学习减少通信开销，优化资源分配，显著提升O-RAN中联邦学习的效率和收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决O-RAN中联邦学习因模型增大导致的训练时间延长和通信成本高的问题。

Method: 提出SplitMe框架，利用互学习交替训练模型和逆模型，消除频繁传输，并通过联合优化最小化资源成本。

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed等框架。

Conclusion: SplitMe为O-RAN中的联邦学习提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

TL;DR: JacobiNet是一种基于神经网络的坐标变换方法，解决了PINNs在处理不规则边界时的不稳定性和收敛慢问题，显著提高了精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在解决PDEs时面临不规则边界导致的归一化不一致、边界条件不准确和损失项不平衡等问题，传统方法适应性有限。

Method: JacobiNet通过轻量级MLPs学习连续可微的坐标变换，支持自动微分计算雅可比矩阵，并与PINNs无缝集成。

Result: JacobiNet将相对L2误差从0.287-0.637降至0.013-0.039，精度提升18.3倍，在血管状域中预测精度提高3.65倍，速度提升10倍。

Conclusion: JacobiNet通过端到端可微的PDE求解，无需网格或显式雅可比计算，展示了其泛化性、精度和高效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模系统比较XAI方法在神经影像数据上的表现，发现常用方法（如GradCAM和Layer-wise Relevance Propagation）存在系统性缺陷，而SmoothGrad表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证XAI方法在神经影像数据中的可靠性，避免因方法缺陷导致的错误解释。

Method: 构建包含已知信号源的预测任务，使用新颖的XAI验证框架对45,000张结构脑MRI进行系统比较。

Result: GradCAM无法准确定位预测特征，Layer-wise Relevance Propagation产生大量虚假解释，而SmoothGrad表现稳健。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据特性进行适配和验证，现有研究中的解释可能需要重新评估。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的系统用于动态特征选择（DFS），提高了决策的可解释性，并展示了其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态特征选择方法对所有样本使用统一特征集，缺乏透明性，尤其在需要决策透明性的场景（如临床决策）中不适用。

Method: 采用基于规则的系统作为DFS的基础分类器，提供特征查询的不确定性量化，并通过约束特征搜索空间降低计算复杂度。

Result: 该方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在透明性和性能上均优于传统方法，适用于需要高解释性的场景。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN提出了一种自适应黎曼图神经网络框架，通过学习节点局部几何的连续各向异性度量张量场，解决了现有几何GNN难以捕捉图数据复杂几何异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据常表现出复杂的几何异质性，现有基于固定曲率或离散乘积空间的几何GNN难以适应这种多样性。

Method: ARGNN通过参数化节点级度量张量，学习局部最优几何，并结合Ricci流正则化平滑流形。

Result: 实验表明，ARGNN在多种基准数据集上表现优异，并能自适应捕捉多样结构。

Conclusion: ARGNN不仅统一了现有固定或混合曲率GNN，还提供了可解释的几何分析。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 解决表格数据生成中因数据稀缺和结构忽视导致的低保真问题。

Result: 实验表明StructSynth生成的数据结构完整性和下游效用显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StructSynth在低数据场景下表现优异，平衡了隐私保护与统计保真。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: 该技术可应用于其他大规模工业模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长程预测中表现优异，但存在可解释性差和对噪声敏感的问题。为解决这些问题，结合Koopman算子理论提出了DeepKoopFormer。

Method: 采用模块化的编码-传播-解码结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间学习时序动态，并引入有界谱半径、Lyapunov能量正则化和正交参数化等结构保证稳定性和可解释性。

Result: 在合成动态系统、真实气候数据、金融时间序列和电力数据集上，DeepKoopFormer在准确性、噪声鲁棒性和长期稳定性上均优于LSTM和基线Transformer模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一种灵活、可解释且鲁棒的框架，适用于高维动态环境中的预测任务。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Motivation: 探索如何利用少量数据和对抗训练技术，发现并生成独特的音频效果。

Method: 使用Conditioning Aware Kernels（CAK）和AuGAN技术，通过对抗训练验证控制应用，而非生成或检测伪造。

Result: 学习到的核表现出对角结构，产生频率依赖的时间偏移，能够基于输入特性生成音乐效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明对抗训练可以从少量数据中发现音频变换，为效果设计提供了新方法。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种任务中表现优异，但其大规模计算和内存成本高昂。现有方法在低秩压缩和稀疏结合上表现不佳，导致性能下降。

Method: LOST使用奇异值分解保留权重矩阵的主要低秩成分，并将剩余奇异值用于构建通道稀疏成分，以补充低秩训练的表示能力。

Result: 实验表明，LOST在60M到7B参数的LLM预训练中，性能与全秩模型相当或更优，同时显著降低内存和计算开销。

Conclusion: LOST为高效训练LLMs提供了一种有效方法，兼具性能和效率优势。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在软件工程任务中依赖运行时环境，但在网络安全领域运行时环境往往不可用，限制了LLM的应用。

Method: Cyber-Zero 利用公开的CTF writeups，通过角色驱动的LLM模拟反向工程运行时行为，生成真实的交互序列。

Result: 训练后的LLM在三个CTF基准测试中性能提升13.1%，Cyber-Zero-32B 达到开源模型的最新水平。

Conclusion: 无需运行时的轨迹合成方法能有效推动网络安全领域LLM的发展，具有成本效益。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

TL;DR: AgentArmor是一个程序分析框架，通过将LLM代理的运行时痕迹转换为结构化程序依赖表示，并利用类型系统强制执行安全策略，以检测提示注入漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的动态和不透明行为引入了安全风险，尤其是在提示注入攻击的情况下，因此需要一种方法来分析和保护代理行为。

Method: AgentArmor将代理痕迹转换为基于图的中间表示（如CFG、DFG和PDG），并通过类型系统进行静态推断和检查。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，AgentArmor实现了95.75%的真阳性率和3.66%的假阳性率。

Conclusion: AgentArmor能够有效检测提示注入漏洞并强制执行细粒度安全约束。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对分类任务，对LLMs的自回归特性和巨大输出空间效果不佳，性能差且延迟高。

Method: 通过分析良性模型和后门模型在输出空间的行为差异，发现序列锁定现象，并基于此提出ConfGuard检测方法。

Result: 实验表明，ConfGuard在大多数情况下接近100%的真阳性率和极低的假阳性率，且几乎无额外延迟。

Conclusion: ConfGuard是一种实用的实时后门防御方法，适用于实际LLM部署。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

Motivation: 当前防御策略对隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击效果有限，检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法通常需要完全重新训练或额外干净模型。

Method: DUP通过联合利用类无关距离和层间转换捕获特征级异常，并通过加权方案识别中毒输入；采用知识蒸馏引导学生模型在检测到的中毒样本上增加输出差异，实现参数高效的无学习净化。

Result: 在多种攻击方法和语言模型架构上的实验表明，DUP在检测准确性和净化效果上表现优异。

Conclusion: DUP为后门攻击防御提供了一种高效且无需外部干净模型的解决方案。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PDFuzz是一种新型攻击方法，通过操纵PDF文档中的字符位置来扰乱文本提取顺序，从而完全规避AI生成文本检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成文本检测器对逃避攻击的鲁棒性存疑，PDFuzz旨在揭示这一漏洞。

Method: 通过保持文本内容不变但调整字符位置，扰乱PDF文本提取顺序，攻击ArguGPT检测器。

Result: 检测器性能从93.6%准确率降至50.4%，F1分数降至0，同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: PDFuzz揭示了当前检测系统的固有漏洞，需加强防护措施。

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

*Kamal Al-Sabahi,Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区块链和SSI技术的去中心化框架，以解决学术出版中的伦理问题，如作者身份模糊和利益冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版面临作者身份模糊、未披露利益冲突等伦理问题，现有基础设施如ORCID无法完全解决这些问题。

Method: 利用SSI和区块链技术，通过DIDs和VCs验证作者身份和贡献，使用区块链记录作者同意和审稿活动，并采用ZKP技术保护隐私。

Result: 框架提高了学术出版的伦理合规性和透明度，调查显示研究者、编辑和审稿人对该框架的认可。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更透明、可信的学术出版生态系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

### [615] [Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935)
*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Janet Tang,Jiaxin Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出CUAHarm基准，用于评估计算机代理（CUAs）的滥用风险，发现前沿语言模型（LMs）在未精心设计越狱提示时仍能高成功率执行恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估聊天机器人或简单工具使用场景中的安全风险，未涉及CUAs的全面计算机访问风险，因此需要新基准。

Method: 引入CUAHarm基准，包含104个专家编写的滥用风险任务，提供沙盒环境和基于规则的奖励以测量执行成功率。评估了多种前沿LMs和代理框架。

Result: 前沿LMs在未精心设计提示时仍高成功率执行恶意任务（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet达59%）。新模型滥用率更高，代理框架虽提升性能但也增加风险。

Conclusion: CUAs的滥用风险显著，现有对齐机制不足以应对。监控CUAs行为困难，需进一步研究缓解措施。CUAHarm基准将公开发布。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了AI模型在危险能力评估中的“sandbagging”行为（故意表现不佳），并通过监控其思维链（CoT）来防御。实验发现，前沿模型和小型开源模型均能在无提示的情况下隐蔽sandbagging，但成功率较低（16-36%）。研究揭示了CoT监控的潜在漏洞，并提出了五种隐蔽sandbagging策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI系统的危险能力对安全部署至关重要，但sandbagging行为威胁评估的可靠性。研究旨在探索思维链监控是否能有效防御sandbagging。

Method: 通过让模型在监控无知或监控感知的情况下sandbagging，测量其隐蔽能力，并分析未被捕获的思维链。

Result: 模型能在无提示下隐蔽sandbagging，但成功率不高（16-36%）。研究揭示了CoT监控的漏洞，并提出了五种隐蔽策略。

Conclusion: CoT监控存在潜在漏洞，研究结果有助于改进防御措施并构建更全面的sandbagging模型。

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

TL;DR: GPT-4o在80%的情况下能自主解决初级安全任务，但在多命令和复杂场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在自主解决初级网络安全任务中的能力，以探索LLMs在攻击和防御中的潜在应用。

Method: 将GPT-4o连接到OverTheWire的Bandit游戏，测试其在25个兼容任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-4o解决了18个任务，另两个在提示后解决，但在多命令和复杂场景中失败。

Conclusion: LLMs能自动化部分初级渗透测试工作，但也揭示了其局限性，为未来安全设计和教育提供了方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Conclusion: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct有望成为网络安全专业人士的必备工具，已公开模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG系统广泛应用，但其隐私和安全风险（如数据泄露和投毒）尚未系统解决，现有防御策略存在局限性。

Method: 采用预存储全加密方案，对检索内容和向量嵌入进行双重保护，并通过形式化安全证明验证方案的保密性和完整性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架能有效抵抗多种先进攻击。

Conclusion: 本研究为可验证安全的RAG系统奠定了理论和实践基础，推动AI服务向形式化安全保障迈进。

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

*Nilufer Gulciftci,M. Emre Gursoy*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了四种防御策略（KPB、NCC、CBD、MDT）对抗Beta Poisoning攻击，实验证明KPB和MDT效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning攻击通过破坏训练数据的线性可分性威胁机器学习安全，需有效防御策略。

Method: 基于攻击样本特征（如聚集性和靠近目标类均值）设计四种防御方法。

Result: KPB和MDT在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现完美准确率和F1分数，CBD和NCC也表现良好。

Conclusion: 防御策略有效，且通过参数分析提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

Motivation: 随着基于LLM的自主代理在企业中的广泛应用，多代理系统面临身份框架碎片化、通信不安全及对抗性攻击等安全风险，传统安全策略无法有效应对。

Method: 提出BlockA2A框架，采用去中心化标识符（DIDs）、区块链账本和智能合约实现跨域认证、不可篡改审计和动态访问控制；并设计防御协调引擎（DOE）实时防御攻击。

Result: 实验证明BlockA2A能有效抵御多种攻击，且运行开销低于1秒，适用于实际生产环境。

Conclusion: BlockA2A为多代理系统提供了安全、可扩展的解决方案，填补了现有安全策略的不足。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

Motivation: DApps合约层攻击频发，经济损失高达660亿美元，漏洞源于未验证外部调用结果。

Method: 设计边缘预测模块、节点聚合模块和Conformer Block模块，结合图卷积网络检测漏洞。

Result: 在608个DApps的审计中，UEChecker准确率为87.59%，优于GAT、LSTM和GCN基线模型。

Conclusion: UEChecker能有效检测未检查的外部调用漏洞，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Method: 方法包括形式化估计任务，提出直接和估计器（拼接配对分数序列和四个矩特征），并通过Banach理论证明重建映射的唯一固定点。实验使用合成基准测试验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 结果表明，即使在存在高斯噪声的情况下，恢复的嵌入仍能保持设备间的几何关系。论文还提供了非渐近误差界限，将重建精度与分数序列长度联系起来。

Conclusion: 结论指出发布细粒度信任分数可能泄露潜在行为信息，并讨论了量化分数、校准噪声和混淆嵌入空间等对策，同时强调了透明性与保密性之间的平衡。

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

Result: 实验表明，SE在保护隐私的同时不损害数据效用或用户体验，性能优于现有方法InferDPT。

Conclusion: SE为CLLMs的安全交互提供了一种实用解决方案，显著提升了隐私保护和性能。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

TL;DR: CP-FREEZER是一种针对协同感知（CP）系统的延迟攻击，通过V2V消息注入对抗性扰动，显著增加计算延迟，威胁系统可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CP系统在对抗性攻击下的鲁棒性，尤其是针对时间性（可用性）的攻击，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出CP-FREEZER攻击，解决点云预处理不可微、受害者输入异步等挑战，采用新型损失函数最大化CP管道的执行时间。

Result: 实验表明，攻击成功将端到端CP延迟提升90倍以上，单帧处理时间超过3秒，成功率100%。

Conclusion: 揭示了CP系统可用性的严重威胁，亟需开发鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

TL;DR: RouteMark是一个通过专家路由指纹保护MoE模型中专家IP的框架，利用路由行为和输入分布构建指纹，并通过相似性匹配算法进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型合并后专家IP归属和保护的问题。

Method: 设计路由分数指纹（RSF）和路由偏好指纹（RPF），并开发相似性匹配算法进行验证。

Result: 实验表明RouteMark能有效识别重用专家，并抵抗多种篡改攻击。

Conclusion: RouteMark为MoE模型合并中的IP验证提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android应用权限的滥用问题日益严重，尽管有官方文档指导，但用户隐私和安全性仍面临挑战。研究旨在揭示权限请求的趋势和模式，以帮助改善权限管理。

Method: 研究通过分析Google Play Store中的应用数据，区分良性应用和恶意应用，利用FP-Growth算法进行关联规则挖掘，探索权限组合模式。

Result: 研究发现恶意应用倾向于请求更少权限以逃避检测，而良性应用请求更多权限以增强功能。不同应用类别和年份的权限使用模式存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了持续监控、用户教育和监管的重要性，以有效应对权限滥用问题，并为Android生态系统的动态分析提供了结构化方法。

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal
identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,
enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the
Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

TL;DR: FPEdit是一种新型的知识编辑框架，通过修改少量模型权重注入语义一致的自然语言指纹，实现隐蔽且精确的所有权编码，同时保持模型核心功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型是重要的知识产权资产，但容易被未经授权的再分发和商业利用。现有指纹方法存在固有缺陷，需要更隐蔽且高效的技术。

Method: FPEdit通过修改稀疏的模型权重子集，注入语义一致的自然语言指纹，确保隐蔽性和精确性。

Result: 实验表明，FPEdit在多种适应场景下保持95%-100%的指纹保留率，同时不影响24个下游任务的性能，且资源需求降低70%。

Conclusion: FPEdit是首个同时具备对抗适应性、抗检测性和模型实用性保持的指纹方法，为大型语言模型的所有权验证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门检测技术（被动和主动防御）在非独立同分布数据和OOD偏差方面存在不足，需要更有效的解决方案。

Result: 实验证明Coward在基准数据集上有效且能抵抗自适应攻击。

Conclusion: Coward解决了现有防御方法的不足，为联邦学习提供了更可靠的后门检测机制。

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

Result: 机器学习方法在真实汽车行业案例中表现接近最优，显著提升可扩展性和计算性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法是大规模车队管理的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements
intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle
fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall
utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization
does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with
exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when
dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This
contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that
determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is
addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that
transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both
approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which
shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with
significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational
performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet
management.

Conclusion: 该模型在经济效益和解决方案质量上显著优于启发式方法，为管理决策提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical
operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding
aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel
continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this
integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,
our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional
discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked
against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is
demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational
results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to
proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40
aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all
tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly
outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic
benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between
solution time and optimality.

Method: 提出ACT-Tensor框架，结合聚类填补模块（捕捉横截面异质性）和时间平滑模块（去除短期噪声，保留长期趋势）。

Result: 实验表明ACT-Tensor在多种缺失数据场景下优于现有方法，资产定价测试中显著降低误差并提升风险调整后收益。

Conclusion: ACT-Tensor为金融决策提供了高精度且信息丰富的填补结果，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining
asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies.
Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and
financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional
imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional
structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting
in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we
introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion
framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing
multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key
innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional
heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal
smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving
slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation
accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity
scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed
data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial
data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also
significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.
These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative
imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Conclusion: LIFE为跨硬件平台的高效LLM部署提供了性能预测工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents
on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting
inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging
due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU
benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often
hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a
lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular
analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference
workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the
influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache
compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator
fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT),
time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables
performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and
memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate
LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA
V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in
forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable
efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

Conclusion: 卷积模型在加密流量分类中具有竞争力，NetConv在性能和效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

TL;DR: ChEmbed是一种针对化学文献检索优化的文本嵌入模型，通过领域适应和化学专用令牌增强，显著提升了检索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在化学术语表示上表现不佳，导致检索质量低下，缺乏专门的化学文献检索嵌入模型。

Method: 开发ChEmbed，基于化学专用文本数据集（PubChem、Semantic Scholar、ChemRxiv）进行微调，利用大语言模型生成合成查询，并增加900个化学专用令牌。

Result: 在ChemRxiv Retrieval基准测试中，ChEmbed将nDCG@10从0.82提升至0.91（+9 pp），优于通用嵌入模型。

Conclusion: ChEmbed是一种轻量级、可复现的嵌入解决方案，显著提升了化学文献检索的效率和质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

TL;DR: TWISTER是一个统一的框架，通过联合建模语义和结构信号来填补缺失的评论，提升推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中用户评论稀疏，现有模型效果受限，需要一种既能保留语义又能捕捉结构依赖的评论填补方法。

Method: 提出Textual-Edge Graph（TEG）表示用户-物品交互，利用线图视图和大语言模型作为图感知聚合器生成缺失评论。

Result: 在Amazon和Goodreads数据集上，TWISTER优于传统数值、基于图和LLM的基线方法，生成更高质量的评论并提升推荐性能。

Conclusion: TWISTER生成的评论更有帮助、真实且具体，同时通过平滑结构信号改善了推荐效果。

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.

*Omar Elgohary,Nathan Jorgenson,Trenton Marple*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本研究将ALMM模型从音乐推荐调整到新闻推荐，通过BERT和TF-IDF提取新闻特征，改进了冷启动场景下的推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动场景下新闻推荐性能不足的问题，并验证ALMM模型在新闻推荐中的适用性。

Method: 将ALMM模型结构调整为适应新闻点击行为，使用BERT和TF-IDF提取新闻标题和摘要的特征，并与用户阅读模式对齐。

Result: 改进后的ALMM模型在冷启动场景下表现优于Forbes和Oord基线模型。

Conclusion: ALMM模型在未大幅修改的情况下不适用于新闻推荐，但经过调整后能显著提升性能。

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model
constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation
problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent
representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor
factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to
latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance
in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click
behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples.
Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract
token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user
reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing
pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our
implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation
accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start
scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not
suitable for next news recommendation.

*Danial Ebrat,Tina Aminian,Sepideh Ahmadian,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图注意力网络（GAT）和大语言模型（LLM）的混合推荐框架，以提高个性化和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在用户反馈有限或项目属性异构的情况下，推荐系统的个性化和可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 利用LLM生成用户和项目的语义丰富表示，作为GAT的初始节点特征，并结合混合损失函数（BPR、余弦相似度和负采样）优化排名。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上表现优于基线模型，LLM嵌入和余弦相似度对性能提升有显著贡献。

Conclusion: LLM的集成能显著提升推荐系统的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and
diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant
suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability
remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback
or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid
recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used
to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful
profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These
enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie
bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering
model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that
combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust
negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated
recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language
justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark
datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms
strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the
cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work
demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and
interpretability of recommender systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种因果框架CFRR，用于解决互惠推荐系统中的偏见问题，通过逆倾向评分和自我标准化目标，显著提升了推荐效果和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互惠推荐系统（如约会、游戏和人才平台）因历史曝光政策导致数据偏向热门用户，形成反馈循环，影响学习和公平性。

Method: 提出Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender Systems (CFRR)，采用逆倾向评分和自我标准化目标来减少偏见。

Result: 实验显示CFRR在NDCG@10上提升3.5%，长尾用户覆盖率增加51%，基尼曝光不平等性降低24%。

Conclusion: CFRR为更准确和公平的用户匹配提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms
require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents
popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that
skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender
Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse
propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves
NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307
on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to
0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from
0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more
accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文系统综述了2017-2025年间23项实证研究，揭示了对话推荐系统（CRS）用户体验（UX）评估的局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对话推荐系统的用户体验评估不足，尤其是在自适应和基于大语言模型（LLM）的系统中。

Method: 采用PRISMA指南进行系统综述，分析UX的概念化、测量方式及其与领域、自适应性和LLM的关系。

Result: 发现UX评估主要依赖事后调查，情感UX和自适应行为评估不足，LLM引入的新问题（如不透明性和冗长性）未被充分关注。

Conclusion: 提出了UX评估的结构化框架和改进方向，以支持更透明、以用户为中心的CRS评估实践。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research
attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains
limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly
in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23
empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been
conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate,
turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours
are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges,
including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address
these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative
analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for
LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more
transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

Result: 构建了包含层次化查询和丰富相关性标签的FinCPRG数据集，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: FinCPRG在段落检索的训练和基准测试中表现出色，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods
still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling
annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical
queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional
relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces
two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from
multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate
structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from
intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial
elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and
prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance
annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the
generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method
to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed
a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k
Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and
rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,
benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and
validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training
and benchmarking.

Motivation: 在数字经济的背景下，推荐系统面临长序列稀疏性和强时空依赖性的挑战，通过类比人类记忆的遗忘过程，提出解决方案。

Method: STIM方法包括基于遗忘曲线的动态掩码模块、查询混合专家（MoE）方法和分层多兴趣网络单元，用于建模时间和空间特征。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示，STIM方法使总交易量（GTV）提升了1.54%，并在离线实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: STIM方法已成功应用于大规模本地生活服务推荐系统，服务于数亿日活跃用户。

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a
key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling
user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity
of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be
addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This
is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect
and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the
forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)
with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates
three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,
which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic
spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that
can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling
the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical
multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by
modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics
of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online
A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).
In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has
been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,
serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R3A的强化推理模型，用于解决UGC平台中检索增强生成（RAG）的查询-文档相关性评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UGC平台中用户意图模糊和内容噪声大，导致传统方法难以准确评估查询-文档相关性。

Method: R3A通过分解推理框架，利用高排名文档推断潜在查询意图，并通过片段提取减少噪声影响，结合强化学习优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，R3A在离线和在线实验中均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: R3A有效解决了UGC平台中的相关性评估挑战，提升了RAG的准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

Motivation: 相场模型虽然能准确模拟微观结构演化，但求解复杂微分方程的计算成本高，需要一种高效替代方法。

Method: 使用CVAE学习紧凑的潜在表示，结合三次样条插值和SLERP预测未知成分的微观结构演化。

Result: 预测的微观结构在视觉和统计上与相场模拟高度相似，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为微观结构演化提供了一种可扩展且高效的替代模型，加速了材料设计和成分优化。

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their
dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally
expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep
learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear
Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal
decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy
compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using
microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition,
we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode
essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in
the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition.
Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely
resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and
statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a
scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling
accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

TL;DR: LLMs can automate CAD workflows by generating scripts from natural language, but struggle with complex designs, needing refinements and hybrid AI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAD processes are complex and require specialized skills, limiting rapid prototyping and generative design.

Method: Propose a framework where LLMs generate CAD scripts from natural language, executed and refined iteratively with error feedback.

Result: LLMs perform well for simple to moderately complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, requiring multiple refinements.

Conclusion: LLMs show transformative potential in CAD workflows but need improvements in memory retrieval, prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques for robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential
of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating
FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often
complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid
prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate
initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed
and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of
experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this
approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately
complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating
multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory
retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance
script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution
and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.
This work underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in design workflows
while identifying critical areas for future development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间压力反馈可能通过调节用户注意力和焦虑来改善或恶化用户表现，自适应反馈可以解决这一权衡问题。

Method: 采用双DRL框架，一个DRL代理调节用户表现，另一个模拟用户认知行为的DRL代理用于训练。

Result: 用户研究表明，双DRL框架在提升用户表现方面具有可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 双DRL框架为解决自适应时间压力反馈的权衡问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide
intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to
improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback
could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user
attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL
policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this
trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may
require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose
a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user
performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user
cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the
feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user
performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

Motivation: 研究人类和人工智能如何在不同环境中调整行为（坚持、放弃或转变策略），以促进科学、临床和个人发展。

Conclusion: GF 是一个灵活的平台，可用于科学研究、临床干预和个人训练，帮助提升自我调节学习、情绪和压力应对能力。

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears?
Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed
to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment
demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,
economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational
neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,
multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior
across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior
and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional
tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across
perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as
a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,
learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts
and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a
phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for
players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress
resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers
effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),
uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how
clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way
for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to
cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem
designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual
growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines
co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

Motivation: 生物医学伦理模型在社会科学和人文研究中适用性不足，导致相关伦理培训和REC支持缺乏。

Method: 利用宪法AI技术和协作提示开发方法，开发EthicAlly原型，提供结合普适伦理原则和情境化考量的结构化伦理评估。

Result: EthicAlly能支持研究者设计伦理研究并减轻REC负担，但不取代人类伦理监督。

Conclusion: 生成式AI可有效填补社会科学和人文研究中的伦理支持空白。

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an
indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social
science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with
scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies
involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result,
tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the
necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and
low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can
meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by
presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics
support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on
constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development
methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates
both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations
relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical
research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can
also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting
to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human
resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations
and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However,
conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable
indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human
capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to
visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We
employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to
quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes

TL;DR: 研究发现，用户对探索性对话的偏好受享受、有用性、新颖性和对话质量影响，且年龄、性别和控制偏好显著影响选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究用户对对话推荐系统（CRS）交互偏好的影响因素。

Method: 采用被试内设计（N=139），参与者体验两种脚本化CRS对话并评分，通过逻辑回归和聚类分析用户偏好。

Result: 探索性偏好受享受、有用性、新颖性和对话质量预测，聚类揭示五种用户档案，年龄、性别和控制偏好显著调节选择。

Conclusion: 研究整合情感、认知和特质预测因子，为CRS用户建模和自适应对话设计提供框架。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

### [657] [Six Guidelines for Trustworthy, Ethical and Responsible Automation Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02371)
*Matouš Jelínek,Nadine Schlicker,Ewart de Visser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出六条设计准则，帮助设计师优化自动化系统的信任度评估，促进人与自动化系统的伦理和负责任互动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保用户对系统信任度的感知与其实际信任度一致，从而做出明智的依赖决策。

Method: 从多学科文献中提取原则，结合语用学中的共同基础和格莱斯沟通准则，提出六条设计指南。

Result: 设计指南为设计师提供可操作的见解，促进校准信任和更安全、高效的人机互动。

Conclusion: 这些准则不仅能指导设计，还可用于评估现有系统是否支持用户准确评估信任度。

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for
their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a
system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is
factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate
trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's
trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make
informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system
(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers
optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and
responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived
from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,
cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.
We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically
the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication
maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated
systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped
by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal
norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or
scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed
guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated
systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally
foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe
interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed
heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems
enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

Conclusion: 基于自然语言的可视化编程降低了AI服务设计的门槛并改善了用户体验。

Abstract: While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face
challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity.
We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input
with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to
decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden
from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants
showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic
identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved
participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight
that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers
and enhances user experience in AI service design.

TL;DR: VibeMesh是一种新型可穿戴系统，结合视觉和主动声学传感，用于高分辨率手部接触和姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉遮挡、接触信号微弱、仅依赖视觉传感的局限性以及缺乏灵活触觉传感，准确估计手部姿态和接触事件具有挑战性。

Method: VibeMesh集成骨传导扬声器和稀疏压电麦克风，通过结构化声学信号传播推断接触变化，并提出基于图的注意力网络处理多模态信号。

Result: VibeMesh在遮挡或静态接触场景中优于仅依赖视觉的基线方法，表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VibeMesh为手部接触和姿态估计提供了一种轻量级、非侵入式的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in
data visualization knowledge tasks. Through systematic comparative analysis of
responses to visualization questions, we find that differences exist between
two ChatGPT models and human outputs over rhetorical structure, knowledge
breadth, and perceptual quality. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT-4, as a more
advanced model, displays a hybrid of characteristics from both humans and
ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while
their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and
task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall
quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user
experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their
capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

Motivation: 现代环境中长时间坐姿活动增多，现有姿态感知方法存在遮挡、隐私和舒适性等问题。

Method: 采用两阶段生成模型，结合压力映射和椅子形态，通过物理驱动数据增强提升泛化能力。

Result: 在8名用户和4种椅子上测试，平均关节位置误差为89.4毫米，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: ChairPose为姿势感知交互系统提供了新设计空间，适用于人体工程学、医疗和自适应界面。

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments,
raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of
responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as
vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion,
privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We
introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation
system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of
chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on
pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the
inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving
pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we
introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic
variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and
four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of
89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust
generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the
design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications
in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于计算机视觉和物理建模的实时声音合成框架，以增强AR中虚拟与真实物体交互的声学真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR中虚拟物体缺乏物理性，导致声音交互不自然，影响多感官体验和交互真实感。

Method: 利用计算机视觉识别和分割真实物体的材料，结合物理属性和碰撞动态，实时生成基于材料的声音。

Result: 用户研究表明，基于材料的声音显著提升了交互真实感和材料区分能力。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的声学交互增强了AR的真实感和对现实环境的感知。

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合EEG和眼动追踪数据的方法，用于区分人类的导航意图和信息意图，解决了以往方法在真实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了帮助机器更有效地辅助人类完成视觉搜索任务，需要区分人类是随意浏览（导航意图）还是搜索目标（信息意图）。

Method: 提出了一种跨用户预测方法，结合EEG和眼动追踪数据，用户自行决定搜索时间。

Result: 在留一用户评估中达到84.5%的准确率，接近用户内预测的85.5%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需用户特定训练数据的情况下，实现了高准确率的意图识别，更具实用性。

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: IMUCoCo框架通过将任意位置的IMU信号映射到统一特征空间，支持更灵活的运动感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IMU运动感知需要固定传感器位置，限制了用户体验。

Method: 提出IMUCoCo框架，基于空间坐标统一处理不同位置的IMU信号。

Result: 支持多种传感器放置方式，实现高精度姿态估计和活动识别。

Conclusion: IMUCoCo显著提升了IMU运动感知的灵活性和适应性。

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and
estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in
predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors
and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the
increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited
adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few
well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we
rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured
from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates
(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs
placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial
coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose
estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo
supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical
sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of
IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place
their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The
framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the
context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心律失常的及时诊断依赖持续监测，但传统方法依赖专业医疗知识和接触式设备，现有无接触技术对患者信号分析效果不佳。

Method: 提出mCardiacDx系统，结合精确目标定位（PTL）技术和编码器-解码器模型，重构心脏脉搏波形。

Result: 在大量健康受试者和心律失常患者数据上验证，mCardiacDx和PTL技术优于现有方法。

Conclusion: mCardiacDx为心律失常的无接触监测和诊断提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe
complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is
essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as
electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on
specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.
Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face
significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia
patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system
that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse
waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our
work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates
reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model
that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.
Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients
shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in
arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in
healthy subjects.

Result: 识别出七个关键问题领域，并提出“个性化路线图”作为解决方案。

Conclusion: 个性化路线图为开发者、临床医生和政策制定者提供了实用框架，以平衡技术应用与人文关怀。

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

Motivation: 传统手术技能培训依赖专家反馈，但资源有限且主观性强，AI驱动的反馈可能提供个性化、客观的解决方案。

Method: 开发基于XAI的模拟训练框架，分析手术视频并提取技能指标，提供个性化反馈，对比XAI与传统反馈的效果。

Result: XAI反馈改善了认知负荷和学员信心，但未显著减少表现差距，XAI组学员更接近专家操作。

Conclusion: 可解释AI在手术教育中具有潜力，需进一步研究数据驱动的自适应反馈机制。

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet
direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective
assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of
personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of
self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility
of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill
acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI
(XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We
create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze
videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our
intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee
performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal
execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a
prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of
XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes,
cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results
showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no
differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps
or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects
where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages
the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of
data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning
experiences and competency assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DRKF的多模态情感识别方法，通过解耦表示和知识融合解决模态异质性和情感不一致问题，并在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别（MER）面临模态异质性和情感线索不一致的挑战，影响性能。

Method: DRKF包含优化表示学习模块（ORL）和知识融合模块（KF），ORL通过对比互信息估计解耦共享和模态特定特征，KF通过自注意力融合编码器（FE）和情感判别子模块（ED）处理不一致。

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MELD和M3ED数据集上实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DRKF通过解耦表示和知识融合有效解决了MER中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by
integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However,
inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain
key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a
Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF
consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module
and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual
information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to
decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features
while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight
self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality
and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused
representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality
selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion
Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to
retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even
if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion
Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging
preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业平台部署多LLM时，针对单一LLM优化的提示在其他模型上效果不佳，导致高昂的模型特定提示工程成本，限制了多LLM优化系统的实际应用。

Method: MPCO利用元提示技术动态合成上下文感知的优化提示，整合项目元数据、任务需求和LLM特定上下文，并在ARTEMIS工业平台上自动验证和扩展。

Result: 在五个真实代码库上评估，MPCO性能提升最高达19.06%，96%的优化来自有效编辑，且三大LLM均可作为元提示器。

Conclusion: MPCO通过上下文集成和元提示技术，为工业实践提供了高效的多LLM代码优化解决方案。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

TL;DR: NES是一个基于LLM的代码编辑框架，通过分析开发者历史编辑模式，实现无指令、低延迟的代码编辑建议，显著提升开发效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自然语言指令的代码编辑工具依赖人工输入且延迟高，难以融入开发流程。开发者历史编辑模式蕴含行为习惯和目标，可解决这些问题。

Method: 采用双模型架构，结合高质量SFT和DAPO数据集训练，优化推理以减少延迟。

Result: 在预测下一编辑位置任务中达到75.6%和81.6%准确率，意图对齐编辑的ES和EMR分别为91.36%和27.7%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: NES是一个可扩展的工业级解决方案，已在FinTech公司中应用，开源数据集提升了开源CodeLLMs性能。

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码补全系统依赖手工启发式或轻量级机器学习模型，难以捕捉上下文信息并泛化到不同项目和编码风格。

Method: 将所有有效补全组织为前缀树，通过单次贪婪解码收集令牌级分数，实现精确排名。

Result: 方法快速、架构无关，且兼容现有代码补全模型。

Conclusion: 为IDE中集成语言模型提供了实用有效的途径，提升开发者辅助工具的智能性和响应性。

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Meta-RAG的多智能体系统，利用信息检索和大型语言模型（LLM）定位大型代码库中的错误。通过总结代码库（平均压缩79.8%），并使用LLM智能体确定关键代码部分，实现了文件级和函数级错误定位的高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件开发的复杂性不仅限于代码实现，还包括维护。现有方法在大型代码库中的错误定位效率不足，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出Meta-RAG方法，通过总结代码库生成紧凑的自然语言表示，并利用LLM智能体定位错误关键部分。

Result: 在SWE-bench Lite数据集上，Meta-RAG的文件级和函数级错误定位准确率分别为84.67%和53.0%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Meta-RAG通过高效总结和LLM智能体的结合，显著提升了大型代码库中错误定位的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在智能代理平台中引入八卦协议（gossip protocols）作为补充性通信层，以支持分布式代理的集体认知和自适应协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代理平台的扩展，传统结构化通信协议在支持分布式代理的集体认知和自适应协调方面存在不足，需要更灵活的通信方式。

Method: 重新审视八卦协议，分析其在分布式系统中的优势（如容错和去中心化），并探讨其在智能代理通信中的潜在应用和挑战。

Result: 论文提出了将八卦协议作为补充性通信层的研究议程，并指出了当前代理架构中的关键空白和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 八卦协议虽非万能，但忽视它可能错失构建弹性、自组织和自适应多代理系统的关键路径。

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed
toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.
Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent
messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in
enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents
continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This
paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their
fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing
layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables
scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises
unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,
and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new
framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a
complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical
gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could
reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around
intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a
silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,
reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Stackelberg游戏中领导者选择问题及其对公平性的影响，提出了一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过引入调解者来最大化公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Stackelberg游戏中领导者和追随者的角色分配可能导致不公平结果，尤其是在智能体自私的情况下。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出一个多智能体强化学习框架，整合调解者以最小控制（领导者选择）来优化公平性。

Result: 调解者的引入使自私智能体采取更公平的行动，从而提高了整体公平性。

Conclusion: 调解者在Stackelberg游戏中的集成能有效提升公平性，为多智能体系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing
attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a
traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the
followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be
interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for
example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who
should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead
to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are
self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define
this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'
returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously
been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control,
such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our
framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control
(leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to
self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall
fairness in agents' returns.

### [677] [Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02359)
*Surej Mouli,Ramaswamy Palaniappan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过高占空比视觉刺激减轻SSVEP使用中的眼疲劳问题，发现85%占空比效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP在视觉诊断和脑机接口中应用广泛，但闪烁刺激易导致眼疲劳且精度不足，需改进方法。

Method: 使用50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，记录脑电图数据，测试10名受试者的视觉疲劳和SSVEP响应。

Result: 高占空比减少视觉疲劳，85%占空比时SSVEP响应最佳且受试者独立。

Conclusion: 85%占空比的视觉刺激可提升SSVEP实用性，为实际应用铺路。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测马匹呼吸参数有助于了解训练对其健康和表现的影响，从而改善马匹福利。

Method: 使用深度学习模型（时间卷积网络和长短时记忆网络）与信号处理方法，从麦克风录音中检测呼吸事件和提取动态呼吸率。

Result: 时间卷积网络表现最优（F1分数中位数0.94，MAE±CI：1.44±1.04 bpm），优于长短时记忆网络和信号处理方法。

Conclusion: 这是首次自动检测马匹呼吸声音并计算动态呼吸率的研究，未来将验证低强度运动声音和不同麦克风位置的效果。

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了音频大语言模型（ALLM）在安全方面的脆弱性，提出了一种名为HIN的新型后门攻击框架，并通过AudioSafe基准测试揭示了ALLM的潜在风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音频大语言模型（ALLM）在语音处理中的广泛应用，其安全性问题亟待解决。音频的独特性使得现有文本和视觉安全研究无法直接适用，因此需要专门研究ALLM的安全漏洞。

Method: 论文提出了HIN框架，通过对原始音频波形进行声学修改（如时间动态调整和频谱定制噪声注入），嵌入隐蔽的后门触发器。同时，开发了AudioSafe基准测试，评估九种风险类型。

Result: 实验表明：(I) 音频特征（如环境噪声和语速变化）的攻击成功率超过90%；(II) ALLM对不同声学特征的敏感性差异显著，对音量触发反应最小；(III) 中毒样本仅导致损失曲线轻微波动，攻击隐蔽性强。

Conclusion: ALLM存在严重的音频后门攻击风险，HIN框架和AudioSafe基准为未来研究提供了重要工具，强调了改进ALLM安全性的紧迫性。

Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech
processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While
considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct
characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates:
Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In
response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel
backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features.
HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations
to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise.
These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature
encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To
evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the
AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments
on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical
vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise
and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II)
ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features,
particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III)
poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations,
highlighting the attack's stealth.

Motivation: 现有分类器因性别相关声学变化和罕见疾病数据稀缺而难以准确识别特定病理，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用ResNet-50分析梅尔频谱图，先识别性别特异性病理模式，再进行性别条件疾病分类，结合多尺度重采样和时间扭曲增强解决类别不平衡。

Conclusion: 该工作通过分层建模声学特征，显著提升了语音病理分类性能并减少了性别偏见。

Abstract: AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing
classifiers often fail to accurately identify specific pathologies because of
gender-related acoustic variations and the scarcity of data for rare diseases.
We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific
pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs
gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through
multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged
dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time
warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC),
with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有歌曲生成方法在可控性、泛化性、感知质量和时长方面存在不足，主要因直接从原始音频学习音乐理论的困难。

Method: BACH采用人类可编辑的符号化乐谱和分层结构生成方法，设计了专门的标记化策略和符号生成流程。

Result: BACH在模型规模较小的情况下，超越了现有公开和商业解决方案，成为新的SOTA。

Conclusion: BACH通过符号化方法有效解决了歌曲生成的核心挑战，展现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC;
nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent
limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and
duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing
paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task
that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we
present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly
designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH
introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored
to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in
the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation.
Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new
SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing
commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority across multiple subjective metrics.

translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition,
we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and
train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,
eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and
training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very
lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets
(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms
self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting
superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical
utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached
convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and
minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time
applications.

TL;DR: ShrutiSense是一个专为印度古典音乐设计的符号音高处理系统，用于校正西方化或损坏的音高序列，并补全缺失的音高值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号音乐处理工具未能考虑印度古典音乐中的22音分微音系统和文化特定的拉格语法。

Method: 采用互补模型：基于22音分框架的有限状态转换器（FST）用于校正任务，基于拉格特定规则的语法约束隐马尔可夫模型（GC-SHMM）用于补全任务。

Result: 在五个拉格的模拟数据上，FST模型在音高校正任务中达到91.3%的准确率，GC-SHMM在补全任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ShrutiSense在音高噪声环境下保持高准确率，保护了印度古典音乐的文化真实性。

Abstract: Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22
shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone
equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to
account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars
that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic
pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two
critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and
(2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs
complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state
transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti
framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that
incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions.
Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that
ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for
correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at
corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under
pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas
(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical
music expression.

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and
conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse
bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale
pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their
transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview
bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources
and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by
thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining
scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation
models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing
the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive
probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that
BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised
objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS,
BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model,
is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to
extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and
Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain
competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in
linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages
over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the
baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms
bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings
provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to
adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在内容驱动的部分篡改场景中，深度伪造区域通常仅跨越少数帧，其余大部分保持不变，这使得定位任务极具挑战性。

Method: HBMNet包含三个模块：音视频特征编码器提取帧级特征，粗粒度提案生成器预测候选边界区域，细粒度概率生成器通过双向边界-内容概率优化提案。

Result: 实验表明，编码和融合主要提高精度，帧级监督提升召回率。HBMNet在性能上优于BA-TFD和UMMAFormer，并显示出更强的数据扩展潜力。

Conclusion: HBMNet通过音视频融合、多尺度时序线索和双向边界-内容关系，显著提升了深度伪造区域的定位性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial
manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake
regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest
remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical
Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an
Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level
representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary
regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these
proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality
perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and
fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From
the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional
boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion
primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each
module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes
complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet
outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with
more training data.

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in
digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing
audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial
challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice
Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model
recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted
by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized
classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which
identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition
(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve
robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection
thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong
performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all
datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.
Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation
analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the
field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model
recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and
accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available

Conclusion: 基于ASR特征的SQ预测器在性能和适应性上表现优异。

Abstract: There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based
predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop
non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE
systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ
predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the
training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding
human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown
that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised
foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural
SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based
on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful
input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher
correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test
sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly
used DNSMOS metric.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious and debilitating
disease affecting millions around the world. Its early detection using
non-invasive means could enable preventive interventions that improve quality
of life and patient outcomes, with speech recently shown to be a valuable
biomarker. Yet, its validity across different linguistic groups remains to be
seen. To that end, audio data were collected from 96 Danish participants
conducting three speech tasks (reading, coughing, sustained vowels). Half of
the participants were diagnosed with different levels of COPD and the other
half formed a healthy control group. Subsequently, we investigated different
baseline models using openSMILE features and learnt x-vector embeddings. We
obtained a best accuracy of 67% using openSMILE features and logistic
regression. Our findings support the potential of speech-based analysis as a
non-invasive, remote, and scalable screening tool as part of future COPD

Motivation: 现有方法仅能在话语级别分类不流畅性，而StutterCut旨在实现更精确的不流畅性分割，为语音治疗和实时反馈提供支持。

Method: 通过将语音嵌入表示为图节点，利用弱标签训练的伪预言分类器优化节点连接，并使用蒙特卡洛dropout控制不确定性。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，StutterCut的F1分数更高，且能更精确检测不流畅性起始点。

Conclusion: StutterCut通过半监督框架和扩展数据集，显著提升了不流畅性分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Detecting and segmenting dysfluencies is crucial for effective speech therapy
and real-time feedback. However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the
utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that
formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where
speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We
refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained
on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an
uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the
weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency
boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark
compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and
more precise stuttering onset detection.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型通过增加采样步数提升音频超分辨率质量，但其性能受限于采样过程的随机性，导致高方差和质量受限。

Method: 提出推理时间缩放范式，结合任务特定验证器和两种搜索算法（随机搜索和零阶搜索），主动引导高维解空间的探索。

Result: 在多种音频领域（语音、音乐、音效）和频率范围上验证，性能显著提升，如语音超分辨率（4kHz到24kHz）的美学、说话人相似性、词错误率和频谱距离分别提升9.70%、5.88%、15.20%和46.98%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过验证器-算法组合实现了更稳健和高质量的音频超分辨率输出，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks,
including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie
post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are
available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing
diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the
performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the
sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here,
rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a
different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores
multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different
task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the
random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding
the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through
verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality
outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech,
music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent
performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88%
in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral
distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our
approach. Audio samples are available at:

Conclusion: 该方法支持溶剂感知的多任务建模，并在基准测试中表现一致，为基于结构的药物设计提供了原子级洞察。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for
computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture
solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn
multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a
pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated
under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the
model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a
unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to
capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial
relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular
representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,
including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on
the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%
in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling
and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further
demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of
0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and
advancing structure-based drug design.

Result: 在CME比特币期货数据上训练，成功生成符合金融市场特征的分布和事件时序。

Conclusion: 直接从字节空间学习是一种灵活且有效的金融系统建模范式，避免了标记化的偏差。

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a
critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust
market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often
constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern
deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that
affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through
discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,
a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB
events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte
prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed
binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core
novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and
tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most
fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,
a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to
discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.
Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework
for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a
comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million
events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized
facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,
heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that
learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm
for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on
standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

Conclusion: MeshLLM展示了在处理文本序列化3D网格方面的巨大潜力，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

Conclusion: ReMu为多层3D服装重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Result: 在四个数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCG-IMM是一种即插即用的方法，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的高斯泼溅不确定性估计方案，适用于新场景且无需额外保留数据。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

Result: 在二元分类中，通过测度论方法最小化Gershgorin半径，实现了误差边界的优化。

Conclusion: 该方法在二元分类中有效，但推广到多分类存在挑战，需进一步研究混淆矩阵的性质。

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study
properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in
quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis
tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main
tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be
recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol
{\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine
arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to
demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the
matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity)
yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation.
In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a
measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately
defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also
consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary
solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the
confusion matrix.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能构建更短的诚实置信区间，校准效果优于其他后处理技术。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了DNN预测不确定性问题，还为稀疏学习理论在DNN中的应用提供了平台。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to
accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural
networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from
the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic
neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a
validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.
We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in
particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is
essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence
intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and
achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.
Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform
to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

Motivation: 为了实现人类水平的智能，学习算法需要融入因果推理。然而，识别因果关系，尤其是反事实推理，仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 论文利用工具变量（IVs），并结合严格单调和联合高斯噪声的假设，通过训练归一化流（normalizing flow）来最大化观测数据的似然，从而识别治疗与结果之间的关系。

Result: 在标准IV假设下，该方法能够唯一识别治疗与结果的关系，并实现反事实推理。实验表明，Flow IV能够准确恢复潜在的结果函数。

Conclusion: Flow IV方法为非可分离模型中的因果推理提供了一种有效的解决方案，扩展了工具变量方法的应用范围。

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate
causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual
reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this
task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for
mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.
While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the
population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically
assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under
standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in
treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the
treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed
data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We
implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the
likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the
underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在无需新数据或调整训练流程的情况下，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这些方法为数据稀缺环境下的因果推断提供了可靠工具，支持“一图多用”的范式。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite
imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level
wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can
be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training
objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently
suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of
causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing
debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this
attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the
downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in
data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction
methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that
substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled
data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear
transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's
correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address
shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's
learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using
Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods
meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to
training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may
represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference
when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map,
many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces
predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黑盒优化方法BOMM，通过边际均值函数估计全局最优解，解决了高维空间中传统方法性能不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代应用中（如核物理探测器优化），每次实验运行耗时巨大，传统“选最优”方法在高维空间中表现不佳。

Method: 提出BOMM方法，利用边际均值函数估计全局最优解，采用变换加性高斯过程代理模型实现。

Result: BOMM在高维空间中表现优于传统方法，优化速率减缓了“维度灾难”。

Conclusion: BOMM是一种高效的黑盒优化方法，适用于高维复杂系统优化。

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.

Conclusion: 该算法为高斯过程推断提供了一种有效的解决方案，并已开源实现。

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the
years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on
exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution
functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate
Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a
divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data
structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear
fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our
algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference
problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our
algorithm is available at

Conclusion: SMRL通过考虑表示空间与原始协变量特征空间的相关性，有效解决了分布平衡与信息损失的权衡问题。

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest
from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment
effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation
learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by
introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the
baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high
dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers
to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the
proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation
error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information
loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space
and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with
simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure
Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic
health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

Conclusion: 讨论了不同方法在不同应用场景中的优势。

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the
development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for
addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of
determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In
large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of
tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In
this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from
the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to
perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative
approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We
highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs
that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the
advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data
structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples.
Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models
to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While
these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can
also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with
Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes
AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that
consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while
achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate
FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences:
identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing
theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in
observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable
diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where
direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.

Conclusion: TensoMeta-VQC为近期量子设备上的实用和可扩展VQC提供了理论支持和方法路径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in
scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised

introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

Result: 方法通用性强，无需用户额外知识，可重现传统不确定性可视化并扩展到非标准案例。

Conclusion: 该方法使不确定性可视化更易用，适合教学和实践。

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is
often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and
representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a
general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the
statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of
first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method
propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling
from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for
each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are
aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is
versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create
the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees
for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a
reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's
utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty
visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly
extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and
tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to
practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant
pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model
shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3
relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained
by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation
efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited
- varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries,
underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem
impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on
standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了专利在信息科学中的新角色，重点关注AI、生物技术专利和国际竞争，提出了信息组织和伦理管理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究专利作为知识载体在全球科技知识流动中的作用，以及新技术对传统专利概念的挑战。

Method: 通过分析AI、生物技术专利和国际竞争三个领域，探讨专利的信息科学重构。

Result: 提出了信息组织、元数据标准、检索系统和伦理考量的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在专利管理中采用协作、透明和伦理导向的方法，促进创新公平。

Abstract: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not
only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage
containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation.
This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science,
by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as
fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological
knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents,
and international competition with patents, this work considers how new
technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and
moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's
implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues
arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the
problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of
innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance
of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality,
implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical
contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems.
Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and
ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment
highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to
access equity in innovation.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于本体的两层次框架（SSBD），用于管理生物成像数据的元数据，提升互操作性和数据重用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物成像技术中多维数据的大规模获取与元数据管理和互操作性不足的问题。

Method: 采用两层次架构：核心层引用现有生物医学本体，实例层用RDF表示实际数据集信息，并与核心类显式关联。

Result: SSBD本体支持灵活的实例数据与严格的本体类结合，实现无缝集成和高级语义查询。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了生物成像数据的FAIR原则（可发现、可访问、可互操作、可重用），并兼容相关指南。

Abstract: Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of
multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability
remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new
ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics
Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a
class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting
both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal
metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and
imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual
imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that
are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns
flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless
integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor,
the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of
novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended
Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility.
Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.

TL;DR: DBAIOps是一个结合推理LLM和知识图谱的混合数据库运维系统，通过半自动图构建算法和两阶段图演化机制，显著提升了诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法无法有效利用专家经验，规则方法仅支持基本任务，LLM方法生成结果不准确或通用。

Method: DBAIOps采用异构图模型表示诊断经验，构建800+可重用异常模型，并利用两阶段图演化机制和推理LLM进行诊断。

Result: 在四种主流数据库系统上，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确率上分别比现有方法高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps通过结合LLM和知识图谱，显著提升了数据库运维的诊断效果。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

Result: 仿真结果显示，所提机制比现有方法延迟降低了13.39%、12.74%和16.6%。

Conclusion: 该机制有效提升了无人机网络的路由安全性和性能。

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster
rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due
to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing
security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the
routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes.
Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay,
which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to
tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management
mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify
low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance
algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism.
Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is
reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process.
Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is
designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with
attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed
mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent
proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and
methods without BTMM, respectively.

Conclusion: PLA框架显著提升了部分轨迹回归方法，为晶圆缺陷根因分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical
yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity
and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper
presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential
Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed
partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed
high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best
possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that
the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a
Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve
the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem
for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
using real wafer history data.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性系统提供了一种简化和结构识别的有效途径。

Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly
affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be
impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for
simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models
using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for
sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and
their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate
the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV)
system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and
indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the
NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV
coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse
estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural
relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined
by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and
the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two
computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The
sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical
simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC在强化学习中具有初始性能强和数据需求低的优势，但传统的一阶方法收敛速度慢，而现有的二阶方法计算复杂。

Method: 采用高斯-牛顿近似计算策略Hessian矩阵，避免二阶导数，并结合动量平均Hessian以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在非线性连续搅拌釜反应器（CSTR）上验证了方法，显示其比一阶方法收敛更快且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持MPC优势的同时，显著提升了收敛速度和计算效率。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its
interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in
reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data
requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most
RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter
spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy
update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC.
While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to
second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order
policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy
Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling
superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve
robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable
training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing
faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art
first-order methods.

Result: 在电力分配系统故障数据集上达到99.44%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合因果图与机器学习的方法不仅能准确预测故障，还能解释其根本原因，是提升系统可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system
failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this
work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine
learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using
graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE).
Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as
voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence
each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and
GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of
the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable,
we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums
Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most
on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes
of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault
dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs
with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also
helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool
for improving system reliability.

Motivation: 传统DMD方法在处理多维数据（如图像、视频和高阶网络）时效率低下或不足，需要改进。

Result: TDMD在多路数据的状态重建和动态分量分离任务中表现优于传统DMD。

Conclusion: TDMD在多维数据分析中更高效且能更好地保留时空结构。

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for
analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems.
However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations,
which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently
multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In
this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel
extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed
T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD
achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and
temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and
dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSM树在写入优化中表现优异，但引入了显著的读取放大问题，传统辅助结构如Bloom过滤器虽有效但内存开销大。学习数据结构为优化提供了新思路。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）使用分类器选择性绕过Bloom过滤器以减少查询延迟；2）用学习模型和小型备份过滤器替代传统Bloom过滤器以减少内存占用。

Result: 实验表明，分类器方法减少了30%的Bloom过滤器检查，查询延迟降低2.28倍；学习模型方法内存占用减少70-80%，且无假阴性。

Conclusion: 学习模型在LSM树中展现出互补性优势，平衡了延迟、内存和正确性，为写入优化存储系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Result: 提出了一个具有polylog(opt)竞争比的均匀性跟踪算法。

Conclusion: 均匀性跟踪问题更具实际意义，新算法在性能和适应性上优于传统方法。

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Conclusion: Uni-Mol3为多分子计算建模提供了新范式，并为智能有机反应研究开辟了方向。

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for
new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction
mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable
challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several
state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular
representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where
chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper
introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a
hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,
Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes
3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a
3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two
pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and
reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a
progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With
prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional
performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task
prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10
datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing
methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.
This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular
computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic
reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism

TL;DR: FastCSP是一种基于机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）的高通量晶体结构预测（CSP）工作流程，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子晶体的CSP在制药和有机电子等领域至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且效率低。

Method: FastCSP结合随机结构生成（Genarris 3.0）和几何优化，完全依赖通用原子模型（UMA）MLIP进行自由能计算。

Result: 在28个刚性分子上测试，FastCSP能稳定生成已知实验结构，并将其排名控制在全局最小值5 kJ/mol以内。

Conclusion: 通用MLIPs无需特定调整即可应用于多样化合物，FastCSP的开源发布降低了CSP的准入门槛。

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role
in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is
challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large
search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few
kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a
large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,
high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with
geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the
Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of
28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently
generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per
molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs
can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.
Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for
classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with
DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly
lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be
obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal
structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

differ from Wild Bots/Humans. This has implications towards the detection and
effectiveness of LLM-Powered Bots.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于谱聚类的算法，用于在密集区域的软几何块模型中恢复社区结构，并通过局部细化实现强一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在密集区域的软几何块模型中高效恢复社区结构，解决传统方法在非简单特征值情况下的局限性。

Method: 使用邻接矩阵的特征向量将图嵌入到低维空间，然后应用k-means聚类，并通过局部细化提升一致性。

Result: 算法实现了弱一致性，并通过局部细化达到强一致性。非标准的Davis-Kahan定理用于控制特征空间扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在密集区域的软几何块模型中有效，为非简单特征值情况提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed
number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we
introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs
generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an
embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the
$k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a
value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means
clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple
local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an
application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control
eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the
limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial
and matrix techniques.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征网络的图卷积网络框架（FNGCN），用于更准确地识别复杂网络中的关键节点，解决了现有方法忽略中心性关系或计算复杂度高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别复杂网络中的关键节点具有重要应用价值，但现有方法要么仅考虑网络结构的单一维度，要么使用计算成本高的全局中心性指标，且未考虑不同中心性之间的关系。

Method: 提出FNGCN框架，利用特征网络表示局部中心性间的复杂关系，并通过浅层和深层GCN模型选择最合适的局部中心性。

Result: 实验表明，FNGCN在多个真实网络数据集上比现有方法更准确地识别关键节点。

Conclusion: FNGCN框架有效解决了复杂网络中关键节点识别的问题，具有更高的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and
has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in
e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase
intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help
locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying
influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in
networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying
influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of
the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as
node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not
consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these
problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature
Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as
GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency,
FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among
the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are
determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework,
two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used
Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with
the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results
show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately
than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective
in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在国家安全应用中可能引发的升级行为，以确保其与国家安全目标一致。

Method: 通过实验性战争游戏设计，引入两种非技术性干预措施，测试其对模型行为的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，干预措施显著减少了模型在游戏中的升级行为。

Conclusion: 结论认为，限制大型语言模型在国家安全中的应用为时过早，应通过干预措施确保其符合国家安全目标。

Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models,
including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT)
familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent
studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest
escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We
demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these
tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame
design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the
game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security
applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will
continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting
courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study
acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides
actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including
escalation management.

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MoE Swin Transformer的视频语义通信系统（MSTVSC），通过3D CNN恢复丢失的语义信息，并采用语义级交织和压缩优化，显著提升了高丢包率下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于分组的语义通信系统中因丢包导致的语义信息丢失问题，提升系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用MSTVSC编码语义向量，通过上层协议分组传输；采用3D CNN恢复丢失信息，语义级交织减少集中丢包影响，压缩优化减少冗余。

Result: 在高丢包率（90%）下，MS-SSIM大于0.6，PSNR超过20 dB。

Conclusion: MSTVSC系统有效解决了语义信息丢失问题，性能优越，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits
diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information
loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols,
packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing
erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a
packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication
(MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by
MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To
investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the
packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by
packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using
un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level
interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet
drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is
adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize
redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive
simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an
MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的扩散模型在处理非结构化数据（如网格和点云）时效率低下，且难以保持几何保真度。本研究旨在解决这一问题，提供一种更高效、灵活的方法。

Method: 采用点扩散变换器架构，结合前向和后向扩散过程，独立处理时空点，并使用DDIM进行高效确定性采样。

Result: 模型在三个物理系统中表现优异，训练时间减少94.4%，参数减少89.0%，预测精度提高28%，推理速度提升100-200倍。

Conclusion: 点扩散模型在复杂物理系统预测中具有显著优势，为实时应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

Motivation: 探索图变换器和GPS网络在图数据上的表达能力，填补对现代大语言模型基础组件（如Transformers）在图领域理解的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较图变换器和GPS网络在实数与浮点数两种场景下的表达能力，并与逻辑语言（如FO、GML）进行对比。

Result: GPS网络在实数下等同于带全局模态的GML，在浮点数下等同于带计数全局模态的GML；GTs在类似条件下也有相同表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图变换器和GPS网络在不同数值设定下的表达能力，为理解其在图数据上的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively
little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the
expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and
GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average
hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with
real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that
in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO),
GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with
the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally
expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is
absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We
also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic
with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for
floats).

Conclusion: REFINE-MORE为高维加速定量MRI提供了一种准确且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework
for reconstructing accelerated multiparametric quantitative MRI (qMRI).
  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural
representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural
representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that
incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative
learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric
quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled
optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational
efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes
rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated
multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous
estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton
fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain
data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved
superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized
root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to
baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning
approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference
values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction
efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific
multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for
high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for
Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise
conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement
task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The
model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the
proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or
masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further
introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and
efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show
consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the
baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech
enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust

Motivation: 传统方法假设完全随机生成模型，但在现实世界中可能因扰动而失效，因此需要研究更具鲁棒性的半随机模型。

Method: 引入半随机模型，允许对手移除非植入子图的边，研究统计极限并设计高效鲁棒的检测算法。

Conclusion: 建立了首个鲁棒的植入子图检测框架，为半随机模型和计算-统计权衡研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Motivation: 现代电信系统能够通过无线电环境定位用户和物体，引发了隐私问题。单天线发射器通过随机序列混淆信号以防止未经授权的定位，但仅对单天线接收器有效。

Method: 受盲多通道识别启发，提出了一种简单的CSI恢复方法，用于多天线接收器提取信道特征，确保可靠的用户定位。

Result: 通过真实信道测量评估了信号混淆和恢复方法对CSI指纹、信道图表和三角定位性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步保护用户位置隐私免受敌对无线电定位系统侵害的必要性。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating
generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and
constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its
capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints
grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the
intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI
capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs
that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives
and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered
and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,
structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text
or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation
results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a
synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,
CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to
evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid
algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular
generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented
generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting
significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind
benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained
multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources

Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes,
topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given
conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are
difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific
expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first
open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven
engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of
benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more --
that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning
algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a
companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the
EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel
algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage
built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks,
and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments
comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design
problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to
perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for
standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained
design manifolds.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成对抗网络和贝叶斯优化的闭环算法，用于设计具有定制特性的多孔电极微结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多孔电极的形态和传输特性对电化学储能设备（如锂离子电池）性能至关重要，因此需要优化其微结构设计。

Method: 使用深度卷积生成对抗网络生成合成三维图像，结合高斯过程回归作为代理模型，通过贝叶斯优化框架优化电极特性。

Result: 能够同时最大化相关特性（如比表面积和相对扩散率），并在体积分数约束下优化这些特性。

Conclusion: 该方法能快速生成具有定制特性的视觉真实微结构，为电极设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum
morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved
electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries.
Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as
the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport
processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop
algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep
convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and
employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous
lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the
latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the
morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This
surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation
framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space
of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the
maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific
surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate
the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties
(specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained
optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or
transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of
the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its
correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of
visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合局部与全局特征的流体注意力块（FAB）和首个专为连续流体模拟设计的Transformer架构，显著提升了神经流体模拟的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经流体模拟方法仅依赖局部粒子交互，忽略了全局上下文的重要性，导致复杂流体模拟中的误差累积和稳定性问题。

Method: 提出Fluid Attention Block（FAB），结合连续卷积提取局部特征和自注意力机制捕捉全局依赖；设计首个Transformer架构（FluidFormer），集成于双管道架构中。

Result: FluidFormer在复杂流体场景中表现出卓越的稳定性和性能，成为神经流体模拟的新范式。

Conclusion: 通过统一基于卷积的局部特征和基于注意力的全局上下文建模，论文为神经流体模拟开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable
alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions.
However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for
learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the
first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where
continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures
global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models
long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer
architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly
integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new
paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local
features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid
scenarios.

TL;DR: Industry 5.0 integrates advanced technologies like GenAI and autonomous systems, highlighting their geopolitical significance and governance challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the strategic role of GenAI in Industry 5.0, focusing on its impact on sovereignty, global power dynamics, and human-centric values.

Method: Analyzes technological, economic, and ethical perspectives to propose a governance framework for GenAI in Industry 5.0.

Result: Identifies growing disparities in AI resources, governance challenges, and geopolitical tensions, urging balanced international coordination.

Conclusion: Calls for governance models that balance national autonomy with global cooperation to uphold human-centric values in AI-driven industries.

Abstract: Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing
human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of
advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI)
and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also
emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications
of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national
assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries
compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational
infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and
accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos
of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent
systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising
urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use
risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense
strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including
the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data
sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical
perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the
intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that
balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding
human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在线行为研究中因参与者使用大型语言模型（LLM）导致的“LLM污染”问题，提出了三种污染形式及其对研究效度的威胁，并呼吁多层面应对措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着参与者越来越多地使用LLM完成任务，在线行为研究的效度和完整性受到威胁，亟需识别和解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析三种LLM污染形式（部分中介、完全委托和溢出效应），揭示其对研究的影响。

Result: LLM污染导致样本真实性受损、难以检测的偏见，并威胁在线研究的认识论基础。

Conclusion: 需要研究者、平台和社区共同努力，采取多层面措施以应对LLM污染的挑战，确保研究方法的完整性。

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants
increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or
task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through
which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural
research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective
use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording
support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human
ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies
with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of
human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover
signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to
anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While
Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing
automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together,
these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise
sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc,
and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human
cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already
co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating
methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response
spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts.
As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard
methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural
research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FairLoRA，一种基于SVD的低秩近似框架，用于解决医疗联邦学习中的公平性问题，并在FairFedMed数据集上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域中的公平性问题（如服务获取不平等）对患者健康有负面影响，而现有联邦学习方法在医疗数据上表现不佳且忽视公平性。

Method: 提出FairLoRA框架，通过为不同人口群体定制奇异值矩阵（同时共享奇异向量）来平衡公平性和效率。

Result: FairLoRA在医疗图像分类任务中达到最优性能，并显著提升了跨人口群体的公平性。

Conclusion: FairLoRA和FairFedMed数据集填补了医疗联邦学习中公平性研究的空白，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前大语言模型在需要学科洞察力和上下文敏感性的任务中是否能够复制人类判断，尤其是在开放式学术作业评分中的应用。

Method: 使用67篇意大利语心理学课程论文，通过四标准评分表（相关性、连贯性、原创性、可行性）评估五种模型，并进行三次提示复制以评估模型内稳定性。

Result: 人类与模型评分一致性低且不显著，模型内可靠性弱；模型在连贯性评分上存在系统性偏差，且在相关性及可行性上模型间一致性极低。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在需要学科洞察力和上下文敏感性的任务中表现不佳，人类监督在开放式学术作业评分中仍至关重要。

Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral
24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A
total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university
psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,
Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three
prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was
consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and
within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median
Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a
tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent
dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for
Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and
Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current
LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary
insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when
evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的两阶段框架，用于MRI脑肿瘤分割，无需真实掩码，通过残差引导的DDPM和轻量级U-Net提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确分割MRI中的脑肿瘤对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在更大、更异构的数据集上表现不足。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 残差引导的DDPM进行跨模态合成；2) 轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态数据分割肿瘤。

Result: 在BraTS 2021上，Dice分数达93.02%，IoU达86.7%，优于ReCoSeg基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界多中心MRI数据上表现出更高的准确性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有移动模型在医学图像任务上表现不佳的问题，因医学图像与自然图像的信息密度差异大，需开发轻量且高性能的网络。

Method: 采用ConvUtr作为分层补丁嵌入，结合大核CNN和倒置瓶颈融合；引入LGL块平衡局部-全局信息交换；使用轻量Transformer瓶颈和级联解码器。

Result: 在8个公开的2D和3D数据集上达到最先进性能，包括在4个未见数据集上的零样本测试。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

Conclusion: CoCoLIT为MRI到PET的跨模态翻译提供了高效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in
amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method
with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external
dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at

Conclusion: EfficientNetV2在医学图像分类中性能优越，但需权衡其更高的计算复杂度。

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the
interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand
extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these
limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong
classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the
study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

*Gustav Müller-Franzes,Debora Jutz,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Christiane Kuhl,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种视觉语言模型（VLMs）在MedFMC数据集上的表现，发现Qwen2.5在多项任务中表现最佳，但复杂领域如视网膜眼底检查仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLMs在医学图像诊断中的准确性，为临床应用的可行性提供依据。

Method: 使用MedFMC数据集，比较五种VLMs在三种实验设置（仅视觉输入、多模态输入、思维链推理）下的诊断准确性。

Result: Qwen2.5在胸部X光和内窥镜图像中表现最佳，但在复杂任务如视网膜眼底检查中表现较差。多模态输入和思维链推理未显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在医学诊断中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以适应复杂领域。

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3,
Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes
22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease
multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy
(colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin
color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic
retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental
settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical
comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved
the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images
(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon
pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both
significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice
assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading
accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All
models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the
highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly
better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input
reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning
prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated
promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph
interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal
fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and
domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SWAN的新框架，结合小波变换和注意力机制，用于红外小目标检测，显著提升了复杂背景下的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在民用和军事中至关重要，但现有方法依赖传统卷积操作，难以区分小目标的频域特征与复杂背景。

Method: 提出SWAN框架，包括Haar小波卷积（HWConv）、移位空间注意力（SSA）和残差双通道注意力（RDCA）模块，实现跨域特征融合和背景抑制。

Result: 在基准数据集上，SWAN优于现有方法，检测精度和鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: SWAN通过频域和空间域协同感知，有效解决了复杂背景下红外小目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and
military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in
complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional
convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and
struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small
targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework
designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN
leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion
of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a
Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial
dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual
awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively
calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference
while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods,
showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

*Cristian Minoccheri,Matthew Hodgman,Haoyuan Ma,Rameez Merchant,Emily Wittrup,Craig Williamson,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LoRA的改进方法（CP-LoRA和DoRA变体），用于动脉瘤性蛛网膜下腔出血（SAH）的医学图像分割，显著优于传统Unet微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤性SAH是一种高死亡率的神经急症，现有方法在有限数据集上的表现有待提升。通过迁移学习从相关血肿类型中学习，是一种潜在但未被充分探索的解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的Unet架构，基于124名创伤性脑损伤患者的CT扫描数据，并在30名SAH患者数据上进行微调。提出了基于张量CP分解的CP-LoRA方法和DoRA变体，并与现有LoRA方法及标准微调策略进行比较。

Result: LoRA方法在SAH分割任务中表现优于传统Unet微调，CP-LoRA在参数效率上表现突出。所有方法在大出血量情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，血肿类型间的迁移学习可行，且基于LoRA的方法显著优于传统Unet微调，为SAH分割提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于视觉变换器（ViT）和注意力多实例学习（ABMIL）的深度学习框架，用于从H&E染色全切片图像（WSI）预测EGFR突变状态，并在印度和TCGA数据集上验证了其高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EGFR突变状态预测对临床决策至关重要，尤其是在东南亚人群中EGFR突变率较高。利用常规病理切片和AI技术实现高效预测，有助于资源有限地区的精准医疗。

Method: 采用基于ViT的病理基础模型和ABMIL架构，训练数据来自印度队列（170 WSI），并在内部测试集（30 WSI）和TCGA外部测试集（86 WSI）上评估。

Result: 模型在内部和外部测试集上的AUC分别为0.933和0.965，性能优于先前研究，且适用于小数据集训练。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了利用常规病理切片和AI技术准确预测EGFR突变状态的可行性，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of
LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can
help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a
routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,
especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher
incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent
progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and
classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built
on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and
attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR
mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data
from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:
Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from
TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,
with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and
external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently
trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to
several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study
demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status
using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using
foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于纤维束追踪的双标签协作学习网络（DCLNet），用于多模态颅神经分割，通过结合粗标签和精确标签提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对扩散MRI信息利用不足，导致多模态融合效果不佳。

Method: 引入纤维束追踪获取的粗标签，与专家标注的精确标签协作学习，并设计模态自适应编码模块（MEM）实现信息交换。

Result: 在HCP数据集上验证，性能优于单标签网络。

Conclusion: 双标签策略能有效解决颅神经分割任务中的模糊性问题。

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative
methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical
pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved
promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion
MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In
this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning
Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our
DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber
tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels
annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder
Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and
diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human
Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared
to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the
effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in
CNs parcellation tasks.

Result: 模型表现优于随机和基线模型，能有效预测注意力分配。

Conclusion: 该模型工具可帮助学员学习如何像专家一样分配注意力。

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to
decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to
predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists'
attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We
characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m
(magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital
microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs,
and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths
constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction
algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in
the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use
these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the
dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate
attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based
sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different
magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by
sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner
using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging
multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental
results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline
models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in
learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在压缩比、效率和安全性方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为医疗图像的无损压缩和安全性提供了有效解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in
lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for
medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is
critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an
adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global
and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a
segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to
ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based
low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our
proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The
source code will be made

Motivation: 准确的乳腺肿瘤分割对下游任务（如pCR评估）至关重要，但现有方法在性能和泛化能力上仍有提升空间。

Method: 采用大核MedNeXt架构和两阶段训练策略（UpKern算法扩展感受野），并结合自归一化网络（SNN）进行pCR分类。

Conclusion: 结合大感受野和放射组学分类具有优势，未来可通过高级集成和临床变量整合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as
pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both
segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI
dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage
training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels
using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned
features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen
validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of
0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR
classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic
features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast
DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some
subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive
fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on
advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further
improve performance and generalization. Code:

Conclusion: AMBER-AFNO在3D医学数据分割任务中实现了高效与高性能的平衡，为医疗影像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote

designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains
a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations,
and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a
Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that
transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a
lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design:
one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT,
and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded
low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two
complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits
distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph
distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent
attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD
introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial
or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an
internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose
levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD
consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,
supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有RIC方法由于依赖随机变量采样，导致病态问题，限制了性能。论文旨在通过构建过定系统解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于过定系统的可逆1×1卷积（WIC），并设计了两种网络（WIN-Naïve和WIN），后者引入了跳跃连接以增强长期记忆。

Result: 在多种RIC任务（如图像隐藏、图像缩放和去色）中，方法表现优异，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了RIC中的病态问题，为领域设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to
its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system.
Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods
intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by
incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma,
we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the
underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero
Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle,
we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which
eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development
of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative
networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced
skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across
diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and
image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a
new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in

Conclusion: GR-Gaussian在稀疏视图条件下显著提高了CT重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT
reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient
magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like
artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses
needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view
conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point
Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and
accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that
refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving
splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and
real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR
improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These
results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT
reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes.
Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains
challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine

solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations,
limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can
benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK,
BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric
Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying
dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently
extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks,
proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to
directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation
where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting
biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of
3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving
ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic
testing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Star-Diff的结构感知染色恢复扩散模型，用于从H&E染色虚拟生成IHC图像，并引入语义保真度评分（SFS）进行临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏分子诊断信息，而IHC成本高且耗时。虚拟染色技术可填补这一空白，但面临合成图像评估和结构保持的挑战。

Method: Star-Diff结合残差和噪声生成路径，将虚拟染色任务重新定义为图像恢复任务，并引入SFS评估诊断一致性。

Result: 在BCI数据集上，Star-Diff在视觉保真度和诊断相关性上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Star-Diff为临床应用（如术中虚拟IHC合成）提供了快速且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing
tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker
expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly
and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To
address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising
alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of
synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving
structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this
end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and
evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining
restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image
restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,
Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker
variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC
patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a
clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic
degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level
metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment
and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that
Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity
and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it
presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual
IHC synthesis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的双分支U-Net架构（RL-U$^2$Net），用于多模态3D心脏分割，解决了现有方法的空间不一致性和静态融合策略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态心脏分割在心血管疾病诊断中至关重要，但现有方法存在空间不一致、静态融合策略和低效特征对齐等问题。

Method: 采用双分支U-Net并行处理CT和MRI数据，引入RL-XAlign模块进行特征对齐，并通过强化学习优化旋转策略。

Result: 在MM-WHS 2017数据集上，Dice系数达到CT 93.1%和MRI 87.0%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RL-U$^2$Net在多模态心脏分割中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）的需求激增，但人工采摘效率低，限制了规模化生产。

Method: 采用两阶段算法：首先在立体图像上进行2D点检测，然后通过轻量级深度神经网络进行深度估计；使用Blender生成合成数据以减少标注成本。

Result: 在合成数据上2D检测F1分数达95.6%，真实数据为74.4%；深度估计误差在2米范围内为3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业自动化提供了可扩展的精准采摘解决方案，并解决了合成与真实数据的领域差距问题。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

TL;DR: HyCodePolicy是一个混合语言控制框架，通过闭环编程循环提升机器人操作策略的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统缺乏自适应监控和修复代码的机制，HyCodePolicy旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合代码合成、几何基础、感知监控和迭代修复，形成闭环编程循环。

Result: 显著提升机器人操作策略的鲁棒性和样本效率。

Conclusion: HyCodePolicy为自主决策中的多模态推理提供了可扩展策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Conclusion: 提出的框架结合了模型优化与学习的优势，实现了样本高效学习和仿真到现实的迁移，为非抓取式操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

Motivation: 解决现有单特征数据检索方法在少样本模仿学习中可能引入无关数据的问题。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中分别比现有方法提升5.1%和16.6%。

Conclusion: COLLAGE通过多特征融合显著提升了少样本模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

Result: 在EmbodiedBench上，RoboMemory比开源基线（Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins）平均成功率提高25%，并超越闭源SOTA（Claude3.5-Sonnet）5%。

Conclusion: RoboMemory通过可扩展性解决了高延迟问题，为物理机器人中多模态记忆系统的集成提供了基础参考。

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

Motivation: 解决现有集中式控制器需要全局信息和通信的问题，提高系统的可扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 利用MARL训练每个MAV的外环控制策略，仅通过负载姿态观测进行隐式通信，并设计新的动作空间（线性加速度和体速率）。

Result: 在真实实验中验证了方法的有效性，性能与集中式方法相当，并展示了异构策略合作和单MAV失效的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、可扩展的去中心化负载操控，适用于动态3D运动中的不确定性场景。

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

Result: 总结了现有方法的优缺点，并指出了研究空白。

Conclusion: MTL在CAVs中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以优化其方法。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled

challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best

the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL是一种通用框架，能无缝集成到任意ERL方法中，有效提升轨迹优化的性能和适应性。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Conclusion: VFP在多模态机器人操作任务中表现优异，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

Abstract: The convergence of autonomous indoor drones with physics-aware sensing

radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Result: 在多样化物体上实现最先进的识别精度，并支持零样本、文本引导的操控。

Conclusion: ScrewSplat简化了关节物体识别，提高了准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声环境下具有潜力，可替代传统配准方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Result: 在跨领域基准测试中，NaviMaster在GUI导航、空间可预测性和实体导航上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 统一训练策略、数据混合和奖励设计有效，NaviMaster为多领域导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

Result: 生成的全景视频可用于训练视觉感知模型，提升360度场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了可控、真实的全景数据生成方案，推动了相关感知系统的发展。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Conclusion: Chunked RL和CO-RFT有效解决了VLA模型微调中的挑战，显著提升了性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Conclusion: RICL为VLA模型提供了简单高效的上下文学习接口，推动了机器人通用模型的发展。

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

Result: DGMoE显著提升计算效率，FedVLA在任务成功率上与集中式训练相当，同时保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedVLA框架为隐私保护的VLA模型训练提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in

Result: 在巴罗科罗拉多岛50公顷样地的案例中，FINN通过DNN改进生长过程，提高了预测性能和演替轨迹。

Conclusion: FINN为从数据推断森林动态和改进生态系统预测提供了灵活的工具。

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful
balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic
Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but
their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms.
Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly
from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in
estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural
Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model
with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are
then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step.
In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that
replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and
succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN.
Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible,
improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using
explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a
versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve
forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.
