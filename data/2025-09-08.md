Conclusion: INSEva基准填补了保险领域AI评估的空白，揭示了当前大语言模型在保险专业知识应用方面的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked boundless
possibilities, along with significant challenges. In response, we developed a
mental health support chatbot designed to augment professional healthcare, with
a strong emphasis on safe and meaningful application. Our approach involved
rigorous evaluation, covering accuracy, empathy, trustworthiness, privacy, and
bias. We employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework, integrated
prompt engineering, and fine-tuned a pre-trained model on novel datasets. The
resulting system, Mentalic Net Conversational AI, achieved a BERT Score of
0.898, with other evaluation metrics falling within satisfactory ranges. We
advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach and a long-term, responsible strategy
in developing such transformative technologies, recognizing both their
potential to change lives and the risks they may pose if not carefully managed.

### [3] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类视觉推理来解决MLLMs在无标注图表理解中的幻觉问题，并在新基准CRBench上取得了优于GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在图表理解中存在严重幻觉问题，特别是在处理无标注图表时性能显著下降。作者质疑MLLMs是否真正理解图表，而非仅依赖识别能力。

Method: 提出ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类视觉推理行为，将估计过程基于图表理解进行grounding，开发了3B和7B两种规模的模型。

Result: 在CRBench基准测试中，ChartReasoner-3B/7B在图表推理方面表现优异，甚至超过了GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash。在公开基准测试中也展现出显著的视觉推理能力提升。

Conclusion: ChartReasoner方法能够有效引导MLLMs进行合理的图表理解，解决了现有模型主要依赖识别而非推理的问题，显著提升了图表理解的性能。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

### [4] [Predicting Failures of LLMs to Link Biomedical Ontology Terms to Identifiers Evidence Across Models and Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04458)
*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在生物医学NLP任务中表现良好，但在将本体术语链接到正确标识符时经常失败。研究发现标识符暴露程度是链接成功的最强预测因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接任务中失败的原因，特别是在Human Phenotype Ontology和Gene Ontology两个主要本体上的表现。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B两个高性能模型，评估9个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的候选特征，进行单变量和多变量分析。

Result: 分析表明，本体标识符的暴露程度是链接成功的最强预测因子。

Conclusion: 模型对本体标识符的熟悉程度显著影响其在术语链接任务中的表现，标识符暴露是关键因素。

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

### [5] [Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459)
*Shiqin Han,Manning Gao,Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种不确定性驱动的协同系统(U-ACS)，通过级联架构大型多模态语言模型和轻量模型，在保持高准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大模型计算资源消耗大与轻量模型性能低之间的矛盾，寻求性能效率的最佳平衡。

Method: 设计了不确定性驱动的级联机制，让轻量模型先行过滤，将高不确定性的困难样本转给大模型处理，并采用加权平均和提示词验证等策略处理模糊预测。

Result: 在标准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时只需要独立大模型的小部分计算资源。

Conclusion: U-ACS系统有效解决了多模态情感分析中的性能效率矛盾，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

### [6] [CoCoNUTS: Concentrating on Content while Neglecting Uninformative Textual Styles for AI-Generated Peer Review Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04460)
*Yihan Chen,Jiawei Chen,Guozhao Mo,Xuanang Chen,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对LLM在同行评审中的使用风险，提出了从基于风格到基于内容的检测范式转变，开发了CoCoNUTS基准和CoCoDet检测器来更准确识别AI生成的评审内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在同行评审中的集成日益增加，但现有AI文本检测器主要依赖风格线索，容易受到改写攻击，无法区分表面语言润色和实质性内容生成，可能导致不公平的评审结果。

Method: 提出了内容导向的检测范式，构建了细粒度数据集CoCoNUTS基准（涵盖6种人机协作模式），并开发了基于多任务学习框架的CoCoDet AI评审检测器。

Result: 开发了更准确和鲁棒的AI参与评审内容检测方法，为评估LLM在同行评审中的使用提供了实践基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作为现实学术应用中开发更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法做出了贡献，有助于维护学术评审的公平性和可靠性。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

### [7] [From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461)
*Tian Ma,Kaiyu Feng,Yu Rong,Kangfei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PtoP是一个基于LLM的框架，通过检索增强生成和合成少数类过采样技术解决MBTI人格预测中的幻觉问题和类别不平衡问题，在真实社交媒体数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从社交媒体帖子预测人格类型在心理学和社会学中有重要应用价值。虽然大语言模型在理解人格特质方面展现出巨大潜力，但直接应用面临两个关键挑战：LLM固有的幻觉问题和MBTI类型在人群中自然不平衡的分布。

Method: 提出PostToPersonality(PtoP)框架：1）利用检索增强生成和上下文学习缓解LLM幻觉问题；2）通过合成少数类过采样技术微调预训练LLM，平衡类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个机器学习和深度学习基线方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PtoP框架有效解决了LLM在MBTI人格预测中的幻觉和类别不平衡问题，为社交媒体人格分析提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [8] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5在生物医学NLP基准测试中表现最佳，在问答任务上超越监督SOTA 50多个点，但在提取和摘要任务上仍落后于领域特定模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物医学文献的快速增长，需要评估前沿大语言模型在生物医学NLP任务上的性能，为系统设计提供指导

Method: 使用标准化BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估GPT-5和GPT-4o的零样本、单样本和五样本提示性能，涵盖6类任务

Result: GPT-5在五样本提示下获得0.557的宏平均分，优于GPT-4(0.506)和GPT-4o(0.508)；在MedQA上达到94.1%准确率，超越之前SOTA 50多个点

Conclusion: GPT-5在推理型生物医学问答任务上已达到部署就绪水平，但精确提取和证据密集的摘要任务仍需微调或混合方法

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

### [9] [Can Multiple Responses from an LLM Reveal the Sources of Its Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04464)
*Yang Nan,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种诊断LLM不确定性来源的方法，通过分析模型多个生成回答之间的分歧模式，使用辅助LLM来识别不确定性是源于输入歧义、知识缺乏还是两者皆有。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得突破性进展，但仍会产生不可靠或误导性输出，现有研究主要关注量化模型不确定性，而很少诊断不确定性的具体来源。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个生成回答，使用辅助LLM分析这些回答的分歧模式，推理不确定性的可能来源（输入歧义、知识缺乏等），并在知识缺乏情况下识别具体缺失的事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的有效性，证实其能够诊断不同的不确定性来源。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性诊断方法具有通过人工干预提升LLM性能和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

### [10] [Emotionally-Aware Agents for Dispute Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04465)
*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究自动文本情感识别在争议解决中的作用，发现大语言模型比传统方法在情感强度标注方面表现更好，能更好解释情感表达如何影响冲突升级和解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在争议解决背景下，自动文本情感识别是否能提供关于情感表达如何影响对方思想、感受和行动的洞察。争议比谈判引发更强烈的情感和不同的社会过程。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，研究情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果。比较大语言模型与传统方法在情感强度标注方面的性能。

Result: 大语言模型在情感强度标注方面比先前方法具有显著更大的解释力，更符合人类标注者的决策。研究结果支持现有关于情感表达如何促成冲突升级和解决的理论模型。

Conclusion: 基于代理的系统可以通过识别和潜在缓解情绪升级来有效管理争议，自动情感识别技术在争议解决中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了语言模型中任务表征的形成过程，发现可转移任务表征在上下文中以非单调和间歇性方式进化，具有时间和语义双重局部性特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型中任务表征的形成时机和变化过程，理解模型如何通过上下文学习适应新任务

Method: 重点研究"可转移"任务表征，分析它们在上下文序列中的进化模式，包括时间局部性和语义局部性

Result: 可转移任务表征呈现非单调和间歇性进化，在特定标记处形成，捐彩多个证据，抓取最小任务范围，而长任务需要更分布式表征

Conclusion: 语言模型通过具有时间和语义双重局部性的及时计算过程来适应新证据和学习新任务

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

### [12] [Enhancing LLM Efficiency: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04467)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种新的模型剪枝方法，专门为预填解码分离推理设计，通过迭代块移除和诊缓存剪枝机制，实现20.56%的推理加速和4.95倍的数据传输带宽减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时高计算和内存成本问题，并考虑实际应用中预填解码分离的特性。

Method: 构建剪枝和软化集进行迭代块移除，分别优化预填和解码阶段；提出诊感知的缓存剪枝机制，在解码阶段选择性重用首尾词序列的KV缓存。

Result: 在预填解码分离和统一设置下均取得良好性能，实现20.56%推理速度提升和4.95倍数据传输带宽减少。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地减少了LLM部署的计算和通信成本，为实际应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

### [13] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Financial Reasoning: A CFA-Based Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04468)
*Xuan Yao,Qianteng Wang,Xinbo Liu,Ke-Wei Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这是首个全面评估各类LLM在CFA专业金融认证中表现的研究，发现理性专门模型在零样本情况下表现最佳，RAG流水线在复杂场景中显著提升准确性，知识缺口是主要错误源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在金融领域应用潜力巨大，但在专业金融背景下缺乏系统性评估，需要采用严格的专业认证标准进行评测。

Method: 使用1,560道CFA正式模拟考试选择题（包含I-III级），比较多模态高算力、理性专门高准确和轻量效率优化三类模型。采用零样本提示和新题的RAG流水线（整合CFA课程内容）两种方式进行测试。

Result: 理性专门模型在零样本情况下表现最佳；RAG流水线特别在复杂场景中带来显著收益；维度错误分析显示知识缺口是主要失败模式，文本可读性影响微小。

Conclusion: 研究为金融领域LLM部署提供了可操作的见解，为实践者提供了基于证据的模型选择和成本效能优化指南。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂指令执行、减少幻觉和空间推理任务中的局限性，特别是在需要动态环境表示和抽象推理的场景中。

Method: 集成中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖的抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，通过上下文学习动态的高层次环境表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中，COCORELI优于使用更大LLM的单LLM CoT和代理LLM系统，能够大幅避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习对象。在ToolBench API完成任务中也展示了超越环境的抽象能力。

Conclusion: COCORELI框架通过混合代理方法和抽象机制，有效提升了LLM在复杂任务中的性能，特别是在减少幻觉和空间推理方面表现出色，其抽象能力具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个多语言、分类法无关的计算高效放射学报告分类方法，基于开源的MedGemma-4B模型，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，在多种语言和模态数据集上达到接近专家水平的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告分析方法面临语言变异性处理困难、需要大量标注数据、依赖闭源或资源密集型模型等问题，且主要局限于英语和单一模态/分类法数据集。

Method: 基于开源的MedGemma-4B语言模型，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，可在消费级GPU上部署，支持多语言、多模态和多分类法。

Result: 在7个数据集（英语、西班牙语、法语、丹麦语）上评估，平均宏观F1分数达88%，接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。数据增强后，仅80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82%加权F1分数。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区在新语言、分类法和模态上评估和扩展。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，通过将模糊的用户-代理对话重写为简洁的目标表示来提升LLM多代理系统的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界对话往往存在模糊性、不完整性和动态变化，传统分类方法在开放域设置中泛化能力差，导致意图识别困难和下游规划效果不佳。

Method: 提出RECAP基准数据集和基于LLM的评估器，开发基于提示的重写方法，并微调两个DPO-based重写器来改进意图重写。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，微调DPO-based重写器带来额外效用提升，证明意图重写是改善开放域对话系统代理规划的关键可行组件。

Conclusion: 意图重写是提升多代理对话系统规划效果的重要技术，RECAP基准为评估和改进此类技术提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但由于生成冗余重复的推理轨迹导致计算效率低下，而推测解码在这一结构化、重复性强的场景中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 建立综合基准测试，在代表性测试时扩展范式（如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考）上评估三类推测解码方法：基于模型、基于训练和基于n-gram的方法。

Result: 实验表明简单的n-gram方法能有效捕捉重复模式，在加速测试时扩展方面展现出独特潜力，建议与模型或训练方法结合使用。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为推测解码在测试时扩展中的应用提供了评估框架，n-gram方法在加速重复推理方面表现优异，需要与其他方法结合以平衡重复和多样化推理的加速效果。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

TL;DR: ParaThinker通过并行思考框架解决LLM推理中的隧道视觉问题，让模型同时生成多个不同推理路径并综合成最终答案，相比顺序推理在计算效率上更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通过增加测试时计算（顺序生成长思维链）来提升推理能力，但存在边际收益递减的瓶颈，这是由于模型不完美的初始步骤会锁定在次优推理路径中（隧道视觉现象）

Method: 提出ParaThinker端到端框架，训练LLM并行生成多个不同的推理路径，然后综合这些路径得出更优的最终答案，实现计算资源的并行（宽度）而非顺序（深度）扩展

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中，ParaThinker相比顺序LLM取得显著准确率提升（1.5B模型平均提升12.3%，7B模型平均提升7.5%，使用8条并行路径），同时仅增加可忽略的延迟开销（7.1%）

Conclusion: 并行思考是扩展未来LLM的关键高效维度，能让较小模型超越更大模型，证明并行计算扩展比顺序扩展更有效和高效

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Motivation: 现有文本到分子模型使用原子级标记化，主要关注局部连接性建模，限制了模型捕捉分子全局结构上下文的能力。

Method: 提出子结构级标记化方案，并开发基于重要性的训练策略，优先处理关键子结构（如环系统），使模型能更好捕捉分子语义。

Result: 在多个文本到分子生成任务中验证了CAMT5的优越性，仅使用2%的训练标记就能超越最先进方法，并提出有效的集成策略进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 子结构级标记化和重要性训练策略能显著提升文本到分子模型的性能，更好地捕捉分子全局结构语义，具有高效和优越的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词汇预测方面存在困难，此前研究发现存在专门的"平台"神经元处理稀有词汇，但其功能组织机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类和注意力头消融实验。

Result: 1) 稀有词汇处理需要额外的平台神经元；2) 平台神经元空间分布而非模块化聚集；3) 注意力机制没有对专家神经元的优先路由。

Conclusion: 稀有词汇专业化通过分布式、训练驱动的分化而非架构模块化实现，在保持上下文敏感灵活性的同时实现自适应能力分配。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在视觉情感识别任务中显示出类似传统方法的性能，但因训练数据集包含广泛普通意见，导致模型偏向主流观点和熟悉模式，限制了在个性化VER任务中的表现

Method: 采用受人类提示工程启发的离散提示调整技术，为每个个体选择最佳的自然语言表达形式，并利用这些生成的提示来更新提示，以实现准确的个性化VER

Result: 方法能够有效地适配VER任务到每个个体，充分利用MLLMs的强大能力同时克服其偏向主流观点的限制

Conclusion: 通过离散提示调整技术，成功实现了准确的个性化视觉情感识别，为实际应用提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

Motivation: 在安全关键领域如女性健康中，检索增强生成(RAG)系统的错误回答可能导致严重伤害，因此需要可靠的拒绝机制来避免生成不正确信息

Method: 使用基于能量模型(EBM)在260万指南衍生问题语料库上学习平滑能量景观，与校准softmax基线和k近邻密度启发式方法进行对比测试

Result: EBM在语义困难案例上达到AUROC 0.961，优于softmax的0.950，FPR@95从0.331降低到0.235；在简单负例上各方法性能相当，但在安全关键困难分布中EBM优势最明显

Conclusion: 基于能量的拒绝评分比基于概率的softmax置信度提供更可靠的置信信号，为安全RAG系统提供了可扩展和可解释的基础

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Result: 通过自动评估为声明分解设定基准，提高事实核查系统的可靠性和有效性

Conclusion: DecMetrics填补了声明分解质量评估的空白，为事实核查系统提供了更可靠的分解质量评估方法

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

TL;DR: ASCENDgpt是一个基于Transformer的心血管风险预测模型，通过创新的表型感知标记化方案，将47,155个原始ICD代码映射到176个临床有意义的表型标记，词汇量减少77.9%，在五个心血管结局预测中平均C-index达到0.816。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)中包含大量ICD代码，直接使用原始代码会导致计算效率低下和语义信息丢失。需要一种既能压缩数据规模又能保持临床语义的方法来改善心血管风险预测。

Method: 提出表型感知标记化方案，将47,155个原始ICD代码映射到176个临床表型标记；使用掩码语言建模目标在19,402个个体数据上进行预训练；针对心肌梗死、中风等五个心血管结局进行时间-事件预测微调。

Result: 在测试集上表现出色，平均C-index为0.816（MI:0.792, 中风:0.824, MACE:0.800, 心血管死亡:0.842, 全因死亡率:0.824）；诊断代码压缩率达到99.6%，词汇量减少77.9%。

Conclusion: 领域特定的标记化和预训练方法在EHR风险预测任务中非常有效；表型驱动的方法能够在保持计算效率的同时提供临床可解释的预测结果。

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用序列化输出提示的方法（SOP）来改善多讲者语音识别系统的性能，通过明确指导大语言模型来处理复杂的多人对话场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多讲者语音识别系统要么忽略提示要么仅使用简单的任务定义提示，没有充分利用提示设计来提升系统性能。

Method: 提出SOP-MT-ASR方法：在语音编码器后插入分离器和序列化CTC层，按先说先出的方式提取多讲者内容，通过贪婪搜索获得SOP提示，采用三阶段训练策略。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验结果显示，SOP方法在两人和三人对话场景下都显著提升了系统性能，而基于SOT的LLM模型在更复杂的三人场景中无法充分利用LLM。

Conclusion: 通过结构化提示和序列化输出的方法，可以有效改善多讲者语音识别系统的性能，尤其是在复杂的多人对话情况下。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将TV字幕重构为上下文提示，而非直接目标，提出了一种弱监督ASR方法，通过迭代精炼伪标签来处理音频与字幕的对齐问题，显著提高了转写准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TV字幕虽然容易获得，但与音频的不精确对齐限制了其作为词字转写目标的应用。需要一种方法来有效利用这些资源，同时处理语言与文本之间的差异。

Method: 将TV字幕作为上下文提示使用，而非直接监督信号；通过迭代精炼生成伪转写本；引入加权注意力机制，在推理时强调相关字幕标记。

Result: 实验结果显示转写准确性有显著提高，证明了所提方法在精炼转写本方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量的伪标签数据集，为训练健壮的自动语音识别系统提供了基础性资源。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种在限制数据访问场景下的一次射出幻觉检测方法，利用LLM生成过程中的顶部对数概率来提高回答的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在问答任务中产生幻觉的问题，特别是在只能获得限制数据（如黑盒API仅提供少量顶部对数概率）的实际部署场景下

Method: 从非贪婪解码过程中的顶部对数概率提取不确定性指标，首先提出熵产率（EPR）指标，然后通过监督学习增强，使用单个生成序列中可访问到的顶部分数到的熵贡献特征

Result: 在多个QA数据集和多个LLM上评估，该估计器显著提高了幻觉检测性能，仅使用小量顶部对数概率（如顶部10个）即可实现高性能

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可立即部署的技术，能够在单次生成过程中提高LLM回答的可信过度，在金融案例中也展现了其应用价值

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: 通过分析ICU出院摘要中的临床故事，综合使用BioBERT情感嵌入、词法压力词典和LDA主题模型，构建了一个预测医务人员熬熬的模型，精度达到0.80，F1分数超过基准模型0.17以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生熬熬对ICU病房病人安全构成重大威胁，现有研究主要依赖回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床故亊中的价值信息

Method: 分析MIMIC-IV数据库中10,000份ICU出院摘要，使用混合流水线：BioBERT情感嵌入细调、专门的词法压力词典、5主题LDA模型和工作负荷代理指标，通过逻辑回归分类器进行预测

Result: 在分层抱出集上达到精度0.80、召回0.89、F1分数0.84的性能，超过仅使用元数据的基准模型至少0.17以上的F1分数。发现放射科、精神病学和神经科的医务人员熬熬风险更高

Conclusion: ICU临床故亊中含有可用于主动健康监测的可行动信号，证明了临床文本分析在医务人员健康监测中的价值

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现开源大语言模型在大学推荐中存在严重的地理、人口和经济偏见，偏向全球北方国家，强化性别刻板印象，需要新的多维度评估框架来确保教育公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛用于教育规划等日常推荐任务，其推荐结果可能延续社会偏见，需要实证研究这些偏见的具体表现和影响。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户配置文件（基于性别、国籍和经济状况变化），分析三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B、Mistral-7B）生成的25,000多条大学和专业推荐，提出多维度评估框架来衡量偏见。

Result: 结果显示强烈偏见：过度偏向全球北方机构、强化性别刻板印象、机构重复推荐普遍。LLaMA-3.1多样性最高（推荐481所大学来自58个国家），但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调在教育大语言模型中考虑偏见的紧迫性，需要确保全球高等教育机会的公平性，提出的多维度评估框架为量化这些偏见提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTRACE是一个新颖的社会技术审计框架，用于评估生成搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在答案文本、来源和引用方面的表现，发现这些系统经常产生片面、过度自信且缺乏来源支持的回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理虽然承诺提供可信的、基于来源的综合信息，但用户经常遇到过度自信、来源薄弱和引用实践混乱的问题，需要系统化的评估框架。

Method: 开发DeepTRACE框架，包含八个可衡量的维度，采用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）和构建引用与事实支持矩阵，通过自动化提取管道和经过验证的LLM-judge评估多个主流模型。

Result: 研究发现生成搜索引擎和深度研究代理在辩论查询中经常产生片面且高度自信的回应，包含大量无来源支持的陈述。深度研究配置能减少过度自信并获得高引用完整性，但在辩论查询中仍高度片面，引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 当前生成搜索和深度研究系统在证据推理和归因方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进引用实践和事实支持机制，DeepTRACE框架为系统化评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容，这带来了可靠性风险。研究提出了Poisoned Context测试平台和基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过微调使模型能够识别并忽略不适当内容，提高响应质量39.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界上下文往往混合相关和不相关内容，LLMs如何处理和优先排序这种混合上下文存在可靠性风险，需要研究其行为模式并开发解决方案。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context测试平台，将查询与包含相关和不相关内容的真实上下文配对。基于神经科学中的Rescorla-Wagner模型进行适配，量化竞争性上下文信号对LLM输出的影响。提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法，使模型能够内部识别和忽略不适当信号。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出强烈倾向采纳上下文中较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容。少量不适当内容就能显著降低响应质量。RW-Steering方法能够将响应质量提高39.8%，并逆转不良行为曲线。

Conclusion: RW-Steering作为一种稳健、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案，能够有效提高LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性，相比依赖广泛监督的先前方法具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Conclusion: 该论文通过清晰直观的方式完整地介绍了指令微调的核心算法，为研究人员提供了优秀的学习资源，并提出了新的研究方向。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy
Evolution) are presented.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统中检索器精度不足，许多检索到的样本不相关或具有误导性，成为LLMs性能的关键瓶颈。

Method: 1) 创建VaccineRAG数据集，包含不同正负样本比例的基准测试；2) 要求LLMs为每个样本生成显式思维链分析；3) 提出Partial-GRPO方法，将LLM输出建模为多个组件而非单一整体，增强复杂序列学习能力。

Result: 在VaccineRAG上的综合评估和消融研究验证了所提方案的有效性。

Conclusion: VaccineRAG通过系统化暴露LLMs弱点并增强样本判别能力，有效解决了RAG系统中检索精度不足的问题，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试主要关注性能指标，无法捕捉模型间的细微行为差异。需要开发新方法来识别和理解不同LLM的行为特征和认知风格。

Method: 使用诊断提示套件和自动化评估流程，让强大的LLM作为公正裁判，分析18个不同能力层级的模型。创建多维度的行为特征分析框架。

Result: 发现LLM领域存在关键分歧：顶级模型在抽象和因果推理等核心能力上趋同，但在奉承行为和语义鲁棒性等对齐相关行为上差异巨大。还观察到跨模型的默认人格聚类现象。

Conclusion: 模型的交互特性并非其规模或推理能力的涌现属性，而是特定且高度可变的开发者对齐策略的直接结果。该框架为揭示深层行为差异提供了可复制和可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Motivation: 无声语音接口合成的语音存在音素模糊和噪声问题，现有研究对合成语音的识别和后处理关注不足，需要提升其可懂度。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的声学模型捕获完整语句上下文，结合大型语言模型进行后处理以确保语言一致性。

Result: 实验结果显示词错误率相对降低16%，绝对降低6%（基线为36%），显著提升了无声语音接口的可懂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了无声语音接口合成语音的识别挑战，证明了Transformer和LLM结合在提升语音识别性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

Result: 静默阅读测试的完成时间存在显著差异，但准确率和自尊评分无显著差异。机器学习模型分类准确率：意大利组87.5%，西班牙组66.6%，合并组75.0%

Conclusion: VR和机器学习可以作为阅读障碍评估的辅助工具，特别在捕捉任务完成速度差异方面有效，但语言特异性因素会影响分类准确性

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型处理情感敏感内容的能力，特别是在心理健康领域的应用。通过构建新数据集和多种实验设置，发现大模型在零样本和复杂分类任务中表现更好，但轻量级微调能让小模型达到相近性能，适合隐私敏感的本地部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs如何处理情感敏感内容对于构建安全和可靠的心理健康系统至关重要，特别是在需要保护用户隐私的敏感应用中。

Method: 构建包含15K+样本的新数据集，使用情感重解释提示增强数据。评估四个LLaMA模型(1B-70B)在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能，包括三元情感安全分类和六类安全风险多标签分类。

Result: 大模型在平均性能上更强，特别是在零样本和复杂多标签分类任务中。但经过轻量级微调后，1B小模型在多个高数据类别中能达到与大模型和BERT相当的性能，且推理时仅需<2GB显存。

Conclusion: 小型本地化模型可以作为隐私保护的情感敏感应用替代方案，具备解释情感语境和维护安全对话边界的能力，对治疗性LLM应用和安全关键系统的可扩展对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出BAME方法，通过模型生成的解释来指导提示工程，有效减少AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，改善幅度达2%-20%，且无需修改模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面，需要开发有效的偏见缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导针对性提示工程，分析25个职业群体、3个大语言模型生成的故事情节。

Result: 偏见缓解后人口统计表征改善2%-20%，发现与训练数据刻板印象相关的过度表征和不足表征的持续模式。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型使用其内部推理机制可以显著提高人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对比单语言BERT模型的性能，证明尽管进行高质量翻译，本土语言训练的模型仍比通过翻译在英语模型上评估的性能更好，错误率相差近四倍，说明本土语言训练对于可靠结果仍至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型扩展多语言能力，需要考察其在不同语言上的性能公平性。英语在训练数据中的主导地位可能会使非英语用户处于不利地位，因此需要验证语言数据差异是否会影响模型性能。

Method: 研究比较了两个单语言BERT模型：一个完全在斯瓦希里语新闻数据上训练和测试，另一个在相当的英语新闻数据上。为了模拟多语言LLM通过内部翻译和抽象处理非英语查询的方式，研究将斯瓦希里语新闻数据翻译成英语，并使用英训模型进行评估。

Result: 结果显示，尽管进行了高质量翻译，本土斯瓦希里语训练的模型表现优于通过翻译在英语模型上评估的模型，错误率相差近4倍：0.36% vs. 1.47%。

Conclusion: 翻译单独无法平息语言之间的表达差异，在一种语言上训练的模型可能因为内部知识表达的不完善而无法准确理解翻译输入。本土语言训练对于可靠结果仍至关重要。在教育和信息上下文中，即使是小的性能差距也可能加剧不平等。未来研究应重点关注为代表性不足语言开发更广泛的数据集，并重新关注多语言模型评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Motivation: 网片移植手术常见但本后并发症问题严重，需要了解病人的情感体验和关注点，以改善本前咨询和本后护理。

Method: 使用NRC情感词典和TextBlob进行情感分析，将病人叙述分为八种情感类别（愤怒、恐惧、预期、信任、惊讶、悲伤、喜悌、厌厉）并评估情感极性，分析2000-2021年MAUDE数据库报告。

Result: 发现在2011-2012年和2017-2018年间关注报告数量和情感强度显著增加，显示了病人体验的时间演变模式。

Conclusion: 情感分析在医疗实践中具有重要价值，能够提升对病人体验的理解，为改善本前咨询、本后护理和病人准备提供关键见解。

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

TL;DR: 使用强化学习（GRPO方法）提升小型语言模型在工具使用方面的能力，解决SLMs相比LLMs在工具使用上的性能差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但计算资源需求大。小型语言模型虽然更紧凑高效，但在工具使用能力上明显不足，需要提升其实用性

Method: 采用强化学习方法，特别是Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术，对小型语言模型进行优化训练

Result: 该方法显著提高了小型语言模型的工具使用准确率，增强了其实际应用价值

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习方法为小型语言模型提供了一种高效有效的工具使用能力提升方案，相比传统微调方法具有更好的适应性和计算效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

Motivation: 从放射学报告中提取结构化临床信息具有挑战性，特别是在低资源语言（如希伯来语）和克罗恩病这种多器官发现的稀疏表示情况下

Method: 基于提示的HSMP-BERT模型，使用分层结构化匹配预测方法，在9,683份希伯来语放射学报告数据集上进行训练和评估

Result: 在24个器官-发现组合上，HSMP-BERT平均F1得分0.83±0.08，Cohen's κ 0.65±0.17，显著优于基线方法，分层推理将运行时间减少5.1倍

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持克罗恩病的群体水平分析，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过实现对大型文本语料库的深度分析，为历史记忆重建和政策分析开辟了新的研究机会

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

Conclusion: 该综述强调了基于语音的讽刺识别研究的重要性，指出了当前研究的局限性和未来发展方向，包括需要更多跨文化、多语言研究以及将讽刺视为多模态现象的综合研究方法。

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，且现有方法需要大量配对数据，而低资源模态往往缺乏这种数据

Method: 设计超网络来适配共享投影器，通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性，利用高资源模态训练，在推理时只需少量新模态样本即可生成适配器

Result: SEMI在少样本集成新模态时显著提升样本效率，达到相同准确率所需数据量比从头训练少64倍，支持卫星图像、天文图像、惯性测量和分子等多种模态

Conclusion: SEMI有望扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态的集成提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

Result: BERT模型达到最高准确率91%，显著超过传统模型（逻辑回归和贝叶斯均为82%）。变换器模型通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制能更好地理解推文中的细微语言特征。

Conclusion: 变换器架构在公共安全应用中更为适合，提供了更高的准确率、更深入的语言理解以及在真实社交媒体文本上更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

TL;DR: 基于投出容忍性的模型推断时域外检测方法，通过ICAD框架和合成技术提高医疗LLM的域外输入检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细化后的专业大语言模型虽在领域内任务表现优异，但面对域外输入时仍可能产生错误输出，极大风险影响关键应用的可靠性

Method: 采用归纳遵循异常检测(ICAD)框架，基于模型投出容忍性设计新的非遵循性测量，通过合成技术聚合多层投出容忍性

Result: 在医疗专业LLM上进行实验，方法在域外检测性能上显著超过基线方法，AUROC指标提升2%-37%

Conclusion: 通过模型投出容忍性可以有效区分领域内外输入，ICAD框架结合合成技术能够在保持理论错误报警界限的同时提高检测性能

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

TL;DR: 首个针对阿拉伯语和大语言模型在阿拉伯语生成任务中的幻觉评估研究，评估了12个模型在问答和摘要任务中的表现，发现阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型幻觉研究主要集中在英语，而阿拉伯语作为全球重要语言，其LLM幻觉评估相对缺乏，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 开发了包含12个细粒度幻觉指标的评估框架，评估了4个阿拉伯语预训练模型、4个多语言模型和4个基于推理的模型在生成式问答和摘要任务中的表现。

Result: 事实性幻觉在所有模型和任务中比忠实性错误更普遍；阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam的幻觉率低于多语言模型，性能与基于推理的模型相当。

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语特定模型在减少幻觉方面表现优于多语言模型，强调了针对特定语言优化LLM的重要性，为阿拉伯语NLP研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的模式对齐重写框架，通过SQL2NL自动生成语义相同、词汇多样的查询，并对NL2SQL模型进行语言变体精强度评估。结果显示现有模型对语言变化很脏弱，性能下降达10-20%，小模型受影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL模型评测缺乏对语言变体的系统性考察，无法全面理解模型的绝契能力。需要一种能够控制地测试语言变化影响的方法。

Method: 提出模式对齐重写框架，利用SQL2NL技术自动生成语义等价但词汇不同的查询，保持与原始模式和意图的对齐。通过这种方法定向测试NL2SQL模型的语言变体精强度。

Result: 对比实验显示现有模型对语言变化非常脏弱：LLaMa3.3-70B执行准确率下降10.23%（从77.11%到66.9%），LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%（从62.9%到42.5%）。小模型受影响更大，精强度退化随查询复杂度、数据集和领域显著变化。

Conclusion: 现有NL2SQL模型在语言变体适应性方面存在显著缺陷，标准测试不能反映真实场景下的可靠性。需要开发明确测量语言绝契能力的评估框架，以确保模型在实际应用中的稳健性。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型产生幻觉是因为训练和评估过程奖励猜测而非承认不确定性，这源于二元分类错误和测试优化的统计压力，需要通过修改评分标准来解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在面对不确定问题时会产生看似合理但错误的陈述（幻觉），这种现象即使在最先进的系统中仍然存在，破坏了用户信任。作者旨在分析幻觉产生的统计原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分析现代训练流程中的统计原因，指出幻觉源于二元分类错误。如果错误陈述无法与事实区分，幻觉就会通过自然统计压力产生。同时分析了评估评分机制如何促使模型猜测。

Result: 研究发现幻觉不是神秘现象，而是训练和评估体系的结构性问题。当前评估标准惩罚不确定回答，导致模型被优化为"好的应试者"而选择猜测。

Conclusion: 需要通过社会技术手段缓解幻觉问题，即修改现有基准测试的评分标准，而不是引入额外的幻觉评估。这种改变可能引导领域发展出更值得信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答方法依赖语义解析，检索严格必要的知识，但由于模式要求严格和语义模糊性，往往覆盖率较低。需要一种能够检索更广泛相关信息的方法来改善问答性能。

Method: 提出KERAG管道，采用检索-过滤-摘要方法：首先检索可能包含相关信息的更广泛子图，然后进行过滤去噪，最后使用微调的大型语言模型在知识子图上进行思维链推理来生成答案。

Result: 实验表明KERAG在质量上超越最先进解决方案约7%，并且比GPT-4o(Tool)高出10-21%的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Conclusion: 明确的、语言学驱动的式偏能够有效提升符号语言表征学习的扩展性能

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

Conclusion: DQO方法有效解决了LLM后训练中的多样性损失问题，能够在保持质量的同时提升输出的语义多样性

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral

Conclusion: 研究提供了崩溃动力学的理论见解和可持续AI训练的实践指南，尤其在准确性至关重要的知识密集型应用中。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

TL;DR: 本文提出了实用的图像内多语言机器翻译(IIMMT)任务和PRIM数据集，解决了现有研究在合成数据上的局限性，并开发了VisTrans模型来同时处理文本翻译和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端图像内机器翻译研究主要基于合成数据，具有简单背景、单一字体、固定文本位置和双语翻译等特点，无法充分反映真实世界情况，导致研究与实践之间存在显著差距。

Method: 作者构建了PRIM数据集（包含真实世界捕获的单行文本图像，具有复杂背景、多种字体、多样化文本位置，并支持多语言翻译方向），并提出了VisTrans端到端模型，该模型分别处理图像中的视觉文本和背景信息，在提高视觉质量的同时确保多语言翻译能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，VisTrans相比其他模型在翻译质量和视觉效果方面都取得了更好的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为真实场景下的图像内机器翻译提供了新的数据集和有效的解决方案，推动了该领域向更实用的方向发展。

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估语言模型代理化部署中的安全风险，揭示了模型级评估与代理级评估之间的根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，现有的安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要专门的代理情境评估方法。

Method: 通过将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击对GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash进行跨模型验证。

Result: 发现模型级评估显示GPT-OSS-20B(39.47% ASR)和Gemini-2.0-flash(50.00% ASR)的基线差异，而代理级评估暴露了传统评估不可见的代理特定风险，工具调用攻击成功率高出24-60%。

Conclusion: 研究确立了代理情境评估范式的紧迫需求，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证，揭示了代理化部署中的系统性评估差距。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

*Alexandre Nikolaev,Yu-Ying Chuang,R. Harald Baayen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨判别词典模型(DLM)是否能在不设立屈折类别的情况下理解和生成芬兰语屈折名词，结果显示模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据准确率可接受，但对非生产性屈折类的新形式处理较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确屈折名词，以及DLM模型能否在不设立屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折系统。

Method: 使用包含49个屈折类别、2000个高频芬兰语名词的55,271个屈折形式数据集，建立多个DLM理解和生成模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习模型和考虑词频的使用频率模型。

Result: 模型在训练数据上准确率很高，测试数据准确率有所下降但仍可接受。模型对类型更多、低频词更多、罕用词更多的生产性屈折类别表现更好，但对非生产性类别的新形式处理困难。使用频率模型中频率是性能的主要预测因子。

Conclusion: DLM模型可以在不明确设立屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折系统，但对非生产性类别的泛化能力有限，频率在使用频率模型中起主导作用。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

Motivation: 解决语音理解系统中标签训练数据稀缺和大语言模型部署计算负担较大的挑战

Method: 提出适应性特征蓄粉框架，使用踏差投影神经网络(RPNN)的动态适配器对齐异构特征空间，通过动态蓄粉系数(DDC)根据意图和槽位预测性能进行实时调节

Result: 在中文ProSLU标准数据集上达到最佳绩效：意图准确率95.67%、槽位F1分92.02%、总体准确率85.50%

Conclusion: AFD-SLU框架能够有效地将大模型的丰富语义表征向轻量化模型转移，在保持高性能的同时降低计算资源需求

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Motivation: 探索LLMs的泛化能力是来自记忆还是深层语义理解

Method: 提出双视角评估框架：模型输出视角和内部表征视角，使用场景基数据集进行评测

Result: 当前LLMs主要依赖表面记忆，在简单场景中也无法实现稳健的语义场景认知

Conclusion: 发现了LLMs在语义理解方面的关键局限性，为提升其能力提供认知见解

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化地将出院摘要中的临床术语与ICD-10编码关联，可以简化医疗专业人员工作并确保医院编码的一致性

Method: 多步骤流求线：先用临床字典匹配明确的术语，然后使用GPT-4.1通过上下文学习预测术语字典未覆盖的项目的ICD-10编码

Result: 在西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上获得0.89类别F1分数和0.78子类别F1分数，在希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上获得0.85 F1分数

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地在不同语言中实现临床术语与ICD-10编码的自动关联，为医疗信息结构化提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Motivation: 大型语言模型微调计算需求高，资源受限时面临挑战，需要更高效的微调方法

Method: 使用L1正则化修剪冗余秩并重新分配，在给定秩预算下动态优化低秩适配器配置

Conclusion: L1RA是提升LLM微调效率和可解释性的有前景技术，特别适用于计算资源受限场景

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured

performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLMs提供了更有效的训练范式，能够在多样化长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Result: 数据增强能提高分类性能，但在增强数据集上继续预训练会引入噪声而非提升准确率，分类头修改带来的收益有限

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指导，改进了短文本数据集情感分类策略

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec是一个利用单语语言模型熵来生成跨语言表示的新框架，通过模型预测的不确定性来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，避免了传统类型学清单的特征稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的问题，需要一种能够捕捉语言间动态类型学关系的新方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性：低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异，从而生成密集的非稀疏语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP下游任务（如LinguAlchemy框架中的任务）中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，生成适应不同时间范围且无缺失值的语言嵌入，在跨语言表示学习中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

*Matteo Bortoletto,Constantin Ruhdorfer,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ToM-SSI新基准，通过多模态、多智能体交互环境测试心智理论能力，超越传统Sally-Anne测试的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心智理论基准测试主要基于Sally-Anne测试变体，视角有限且忽略了人类社交互动的复杂性，需要更丰富的测试环境

Method: 设计ToM-SSI基准，包含多模态输入、最多4个智能体的群体互动、空间动态环境，支持混合合作-阻碍场景和多智能体并行心理状态推理

Result: 评估显示当前模型在这些新任务上表现严重受限，特别是在复杂社交认知方面存在明显差距

Conclusion: ToM-SSI基准揭示了现有模型在心智理论能力上的重要局限，为未来研究指明了关键方向

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

TL;DR: 迭代查询重写框架ICR，通过生成清楚问题和重写查询的交互过程，解决多个模糊表达的同时识别和重写难题，提升检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结构化查询重写方法在处理包含多个模糊表达的查询时效果局限，难以同时识别和重写多个位置的模糊表达。

Method: 提出ICR迭代清楚和重写框架，模型在生成清楚问题和重写查询之间交替进行，通过迭代过程步步改善查询质量。

Result: 在两个流行数据集上达到了最先进的性能，实验结果显示ICR能够在迭代过程中持续提升检索性能。

Conclusion: ICR框架通过迭代清楚问题的方式，有效解决了对话查询重写中多个模糊表达的处理难题，为对话查询重写领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

TL;DR: TAXAL是一个三元融合框架，用于解决智能LLM的可解释性问题，结合认知、功能和因果三个维度，为不同社会技术场景提供统一的解释设计基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释性方法只关注表面输出，无法捕捉智能LLM的推理路径、规划逻辑和系统性影响，在高风险领域部署时缺乏透明度和可信度。

Method: 提出TAXAL三元对齐框架，整合认知维度（用户理解）、功能维度（实用效用）和因果维度（忠实推理），通过案例研究展示其在不同领域的适用性。

Result: 该框架能够统一现有可解释性方法，包括事后归因、对话界面和解释感知提示等，并适应不同机构约束和利益相关者角色。

Conclusion: TAXAL通过结合概念清晰性、设计模式和部署路径，将可解释性推进为技术和社会的实践，支持在智能AI时代构建可信赖和情境敏感的LLM应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

Motivation: 开发支持多语言翻译的开源模型，特别关注普通话与少数民族语言及方言的翻译需求，并通过创新方法提升翻译性能。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：1）通用和MT导向的预训练建立基础能力；2）监督微调进行任务适配；3）通过强化学习和弱到强RL进行高级对齐。Chimera模型集成多个参数设置下的输出。

Result: 在同等参数规模的翻译专用模型和大多数SOTA大模型上表现显著优越，特别是在普通话与少数民族语言及方言翻译任务上。在WMT2025共享任务中，31个语言对中30个排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的Hunyuan-MT模型在多语言翻译领域表现出色，特别是在低资源语言处理方面具有强大鲁棒性，为多语言翻译提供了有效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个标准化的时间序列描述评测基准，通过统一四个数据集和三个任务（识别、区分、生成）来评估13种先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时间序列基础模型评估中的两个问题：缺乏直接对比的标准化测试集，以及评估过于广泛而无法准确分析模型的具体能力。

Method: 规范化了三个用通用自然语言描述时间序列的任务：识别（真伪问答）、区分（多选题）和生成（开放式描述），并统一四个现有数据集进行直接模型比较。

Result: 评测13种先进模型发现：(1)纯语言模型表现较差，需要时间序列特定架构；(2)视觉-语言模型表现良好；(3)预训练多模态时间序列-语言模型超过纯LLM但仍有提升空间；所有模型在稳健性测试中都显示脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该基准为时间序推理系统提供了标准化的评估方法，显示了不同类型模型在时间序列描述任务中的相对优势和不足，为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

*Chang Dai,Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Di Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE是一种基于双曲几何的新型位置编码方法，通过洛伦兹旋转变换解决RoPE在长距离依赖建模中的振荡问题，实现注意力权重随距离单调衰减，在长序列任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法存在局限性：绝对位置编码难以外推到更长序列，相对位置编码（如Alibi）在极长上下文上性能下降，而广泛使用的RoPE存在振荡注意力模式，阻碍稳定的长距离依赖建模。

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码（HoPE），利用双曲函数对token表示进行洛伦兹旋转变换。理论分析表明RoPE是该方法的一个特例。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，HoPE在多个扩展序列基准测试的困惑度评估中 consistently超过现有位置编码方法，证明了其在长距离依赖表示和泛化方面的增强能力。

Conclusion: HoPE通过几何重构从根本上解决了RoPE的振荡问题，强制注意力权重随token距离增加而单调衰减，为长序列建模提供了更有效的位置编码解决方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出难度感知推理框架，让模型根据问题复杂度动态调整推理深度，无需修改架构，只需在按难度比例整理的数据上进行后训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 链式思维推理虽然强大，但对于简单问题会产生不必要的冗长输出，需要让模型能够根据问题难度动态调整推理深度。

Method: 通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)后训练，使用按问题难度比例整理的链式思维轨迹数据，不修改模型架构。

Result: SFT主要捕获推理长度和格式模式，DPO保持推理准确性，两者结合可以减少推理长度同时维持或提升性能。

Conclusion: 模型可以学会"按比例思考"，在简单问题上最小化推理，在复杂问题上保持深度推理，实现难度感知的动态推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

TL;DR: CURE是一个轻量级框架，通过内容提取器和反转网络分离概念无关表示，再通过可控去偏模块调整残余概念线索，有效抑制概念驱动的伪相关性，在IMDB和Yelp数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然成功但容易受到虚假概念相关性的影响，损害模型的鲁棒性和公平性，需要一种方法来系统性地解耦和抑制概念捷径。

Method: 使用内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关表示，然后通过对比学习的可控去偏模块精细调整残余概念线索的影响。

Result: 在IMDB数据集上F1分数绝对提升10个百分点，Yelp数据集上提升2个百分点，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: CURE为对抗概念偏见提供了一个灵活的无监督蓝图，为更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

Motivation: 验证统一信息密度假说在语言产生中的应用，特别是研究英语补语从句中可选补语化标记that的省略是否与信息密度相关，改进以往基于动词次范畴化概率的信息密度测量方法。

Method: 分析大规模当代对话语料库，使用机器学习和神经语言模型来精化信息密度估计，比较基于矩阵动词语义次范畴化概率的传统方法和基于上下文词嵌入的新方法。

Result: 复制了信息密度与that提及之间的既定关系，但发现传统方法捕获了大量词汇特异性变异，而基于上下文词嵌入的估计能解释补语化标记使用模式的额外方差。

Conclusion: 上下文词嵌入提供了更精确的信息密度估计，能更好地解释语言产生中的变异模式，支持统一信息密度假说在自然语言处理中的应用价值。

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性地探索线性复杂度序列模型中衰减机制的设计空间，以明确各种设计选择对模型性能的影响，为最佳实践提供指导。

Method: 从四个关键维度进行系统分析：参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度（标量vs向量）以及与相对位置编码方法的兼容性。在多种语言建模任务上进行广泛实验。

Result: 1. 参数化策略需精心设计，有效配置仅在特定参数范围内 2. 参数共享不能随意使用，启发倾值过大/过小会影响性能 3. 标量衰减通常差于向量衰减，但某些情况下反而更好 4. RoPE一般不能为大部分线性注意力机制带来实质改善

Conclusion: 线性复杂度模型中的衰减机制设计需细致考虑多个维度，参数化策略、参数共享、粒度选择都有明显影响，且与位置编码方法的兼容性需要谨慎处理。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Motivation: 传统的测试方法无法揭示语言模型如何在预训练中获得具体的语言能力和概念，需要更细粒度地分析表征学习过程

Method: 使用稀疏交叉编码器在不同检查点之间发现和对齐特征，并提出相对间接效应(RelIE)指标来跟踪特征的出现和重要性

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到特征的出现、维持和中断，该方法不依赖网络结构且可扩展

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练过程中的表征学习提供了更可解释和细粒度的分析途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

Motivation: 信任咄感知安全性在自动驾驶车辆公众接受度中致关重要，需要研究乘客对不同驾驶风格咄危险情境的感知风险

Method: 使用32名参与者在驾驶模拟器中体验两种自动驾驶风格（平稳咄动态），可选添加跨越行人。收集主观舒适度评分、运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率咄眼动跟踪数据

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，跨越行人使动态驾驶时的舒适度降低倍增。面部表情识别不适合评估风险感知，而基于车辆运动咄皮电导的神经网络模型能够准确预测主观风险感知

Conclusion: 自动驾驶风格咄危险交互后果对风险感知有显著影响，面部表情识别不可靠，而物理信号基于的神经网络模型为客观风险评估提供了有效方法

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法优化提示词重写。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著改善了图像-文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改预训练模型权重即可提升任何T2I模型性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准数据集来推动未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构改进，通过大规模预训练和创新的渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)，在图像生成和编辑任务上达到了最先进性能，超越了参数更大的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，导致效率和性能受限。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 1) 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构改进和大规模高质量数据预训练；2) 提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性；3) 与Qwen2.5-VL-7B连接构建统一多模态模型UniPic2-Metaquery。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑能力上超越了参数更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)模型。UniPic2-Metaquery在多种任务上实现了顶级性能，验证了训练范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的Skywork UniPic 2.0训练范式通过优化的架构设计和渐进式强化策略，实现了高效的多模态模型训练，证明了参数规模不是唯一决定因素，训练策略同样重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，显著提升交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束，需要更直接高效的解决方案。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升性能，并可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型生成良性图像来消除对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。需要一种有效、通用且能抵抗自适应攻击的防御方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型的分布内生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5最佳分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一种实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方法，具有攻击无关性，无需已知补丁的先验知识，在多种攻击场景下均优于现有最先进防御方法。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于人体运动的单目视频重建方法存在两个关键局限：对相机方向信息利用不足，以及对相机平移线索整合效果不佳。需要解决深度模糊、运动模糊和相机-人体运动纠缠等挑战。

Method: 提出了WATCH框架，包含：1）解析性航向角分解技术，比现有几何方法更高效和可扩展；2）受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，有效利用相机平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性，为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新的见解，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

Motivation: 现有端到端模型存在两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对于密集视频字幕任务具有显著益处，Sali4Vid框架简单而有效。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和多向Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT和SSM擅长全局上下文建模但局部特征提取不如CNN，而CNN擅长局部特征但缺乏全局推理能力。需要结合两者优势来弥补这一差距。

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度。

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数少62%。

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力，为视觉任务提供了高效且强大的骨干网络。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调视觉语言模型，实现复杂文本标注指南下的语义分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中语义分割需要严格遵守复杂冗长的文本标注指南，传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇方法无法处理段落级复杂规则

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含执行分割的Worker、根据检索指南进行批判的Supervisor，以及轻量级强化学习停止策略来控制循环终止

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著优于最先进基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理复杂标注指南，无需重训练即可适应指南变化，在保证分割质量的同时平衡计算资源使用

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对不同LiDAR传感器配置导致的3D目标检测性能下降问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术，通过多数据集训练和分层优化来提升跨配置泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同自动驾驶车辆平台使用不同的LiDAR传感器配置，导致点云分布差异，使得在一个配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降。现有研究主要关注环境域差异和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置间的域差异尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出两种技术：1）下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调；2）部分层微调 - 只更新部分网络层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域采集的多传感器配置配对数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调的方法，在每种配置上都持续优于简单的联合训练方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为3D目标检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了不同传感器配置间的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Conclusion: CD-Mamba成功整合了卷积和Mamba的优势，为云检测提供了同时处理局部和全局特征的有效解决方案，在遥感图像分析中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临多类别标注困难，部分标注数据集存在类别不平衡问题，现有方法需要额外模型且容易产生标签噪声

Result: 在8个腹部数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在多样化临床数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更可靠的分割性能。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到自动驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明：UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在各种驾驶场景中都获得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于安全关键的自动驾驶在挑战性环境中具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms

*Zhangding Liu,Neda Mohammadi,John E. Taylor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个用于飓风后损害评估的多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特异性注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP，优于多个主流模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，这限制了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出MCANet框架，采用Res2Net分层主干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文，并使用多头类别特异性残差注意力模块增强判别能力，每个注意力分支关注不同的空间粒度。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张无人机图像）上，MCANet达到91.75%的平均精度，优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG等模型。使用8个注意力头时性能进一步提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的精度提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损害相关区域，支持可解释性，其输出可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由等应用。未来可整合灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型来提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

Motivation: 检测复杂人群分组时，不仅需要局部外观特征，还需要全局场景上下文信息，并且分组结构在时间上应保持一致性

Method: 使用增强的视觉语言模型(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过基于分组概率图的全局优化方法检测动态变化的分组

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的分组检测方法

Conclusion: 提出的动态人群分组检测方法通过VLM特征和时序优化，能够有效处理视频中动态变化的分组检测问题

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，需要开发能够适应多样化洪水场景的准确深度估计方法

Method: 结合GPT-4o基础模型的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤

Result: 在110张MyCoast New York众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法

Conclusion: 该系统在不同场景中泛化良好，近实时运行，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，提升智慧城市洪水韧性

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Motivation: 解决MRI图像在切片维度空间分辨率低的问题，提高医学图像的质量和细节保留能力，同时减少模型参数和计算成本。

Method: 使用MLP-Mixers与卷积层结合的单维度SRGAN架构，在MSSEG2数据集上训练，并在多个临床数据集上进行验证，提出新的无参考图像质量评估指标。

Result: MLP-SRGAN产生更锐利的边缘、更少的模糊，保留更多纹理和精细解剖细节，参数更少，训练/评估时间更快，模型尺寸更小。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN在医学图像超分辨率任务中表现出优越性能，为临床MRI图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Method: 提出伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在细粒度层面交互，保持高效果；在推理阶段不增加额外存储和计算开销

Result: 在五个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近state-of-the-art

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔方法的优势，在文本-视频检索任务中实现了效果和效率的双重提升

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: 将分割基础的检测和分类集成到统一框架中，能够实现稳健的有线分裂图分析，有效应对域偏移和数据不平衡挑战。

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

TL;DR: 本文提出使用混合专家模型（MoE）从语义分割任务中提取良好校准的预测不确定性估计，无需修改架构，在OOD数据下表现优于集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用（如交通场景感知）中，需要准确且良好校准的预测不确定性来增强计算机视觉模型的可靠性。虽然集成方法常用于量化不确定性，但MoE提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 研究三种提取预测不确定性估计的方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差。使用两个专家的MoE在A2D2数据集上进行训练，并通过门熵计算路由不确定性。

Result: MoE在OOD数据下的条件正确性指标方面比集成方法产生更可靠的不确定性估计。简单门控机制比复杂类别门控能更好地校准路由不确定性估计。增加专家数量可以进一步提高不确定性校准。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型能够有效提取良好校准的不确定性估计，在语义分割任务中表现出色，特别是在处理分布外数据时优于传统集成方法。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征提取冗余的问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段使用极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)的双分支并行结构进行深度特征精炼

Result: 在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过整合proposal生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

TL;DR: 基于语义高斯涂涂的快速对象重建方法CoRe-GS，通过粗细分开过程和颜色筛选技术，将训练时间减少至常规方法的1/4，同时提高了新视角合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主航空机器人在遥控指导和灾难响应等关键应用中，需要既准确又快速的3D重建。但完整场景重建效率低下，而专注于关键对象的重建更加高效。

Method: 提出CoRe-GS方法：首先使用语义高斯涂涂生成粗细可分割的场景，然后通过新的颜色基础有效筛选技术对语义对象进行精细处理，实现高效的对象隔离和重建。

Result: 在实际外部环境数据集SCRREAM和合成室内数据集NeRDS 360上评估，方法将运行时间减少至常规语义高斯涂涂训练周期的四分之一，同时提高了新视角合成的质量。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法能够在保持高质量重建的同时显著缩短训练时间，为自主航空机器人的实时应用提供了高效的对象级场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数指导，实现了与人类专家相当的治疗效果，且规划时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手动规划过程依赖专家经验、耗时且结果不一致，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性前列腺癌病例中，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融治疗规划方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发适应性计算机化治疗系统，需要研究计算机视觉模型能否准确预测对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度。

Method: 采用过传学习方法，适配三种多样化的预训练计算机视觉模型，使用313张标准化图片进行恐惧评分（0-100分制）预测，并通过交叉验证评估。

Result: 模型平均绝对误差（MAE）在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示数据集大小减少会显著影响性能，可解释性评估显示模型基于蜘蛛相关特征进行预测。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和充足数据集大小对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架，用于自动化皮脂细胞中的油滴计数，并与基准方法进行了性能比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮脂细胞中的油滴耗时耗力且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮脂细胞图像，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较了两种模型：基准的多层感知机(MLP)和注意力基础的多实例学习(MIL)模型，采用五折交叉验证。

Result: 基准MLP模型表现更稳定(平均MAE=5.6)，而注意力MIL模型不太一致(平均MAE=10.7)，但在某些特定折可能更优。

Conclusion: 简单的集合级聚合方法可以作为滑片级油滴计数的稳健基准，注意力MIL需要任务对齐的池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView是一个新颖的单图像新视角合成模型，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，使用多模态大语言模型辅助选择参考图像，并采用多级隔离层的适配器模块和分离三重注意力机制来提升合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观测区域存在多重解释而高度不适定，现有方法通常从模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，这往往导致严重失真。

Method: 1) 构建检索和增强系统，使用多模态大语言模型辅助选择满足要求的参考图像；2) 引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块，为目标视图动态生成参考特征；3) 设计分离三重注意力机制，有效对齐和整合多分支特征到合成过程中以保留原始输入图像细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，并结合创新的适配器模块和注意力机制，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2作为映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需16%的训练量就能达到竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识迁移能力。之前的工作使用轻量级映射器连接预训练视觉编码器和文本到音频生成模型，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出多基础模型映射器(MFM-Mapper)：1)融合双视觉编码器的语义和时间特征；2)用GPT-2替换线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3)大幅减少训练资源消耗。

Result: 仅需之前映射器方法16%的训练规模，就能在语义和时间一致性方面取得更好性能，与大规模训练模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过特征融合和更好的特征对齐机制，实现了高效的视频到音频生成，为资源受限环境下的跨模态生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Motivation: 现有方法假设高质量输入，无法处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 结合视觉语言模型进行退化感知，设计GFMSE模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，GSMAF模块进行空间域跨模态退化过滤和自适应特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下取得优于现有算法的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion框架能有效处理双源退化场景，实现协同的红外-可见光图像融合

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

Conclusion: SLVM模型通过生物受灵的设计有效提升了低光照条件下的解释能力，同时降低了计算开销，为低光交通场景解释提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感的方法不可靠估计，需要更鲁棒的几何约束优化方法

Method: 提出基于主曲率初始化高斯尺度，引入高效且噪声鲁棒的几何结构估计方法，为框架提供动态几何先验

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射性能，超越了之前的基线方法

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过整合高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，为高斯溅射提供了有效的几何约束优化框架，取得了优异的结果

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 通过结合CNN特征提取能力和Transformer关系建模能力的混合深度学习架构SIT，显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用，在面部美学预测任务上创造了新的最高水准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN在图像处理中通常只在固定尺度处理信息，容易忽略不同细度级别特征之间关键相互依存关系的问题，而这些关系对人类面部美学感知至关重要。

Method: 提出尺度相互作用Transformer(SIT)混合深度学习架构：首先使用并行卷积的多尺度模块捕捉不同感受野的面部特征，然后将这些多尺度表征构造为序列，通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模它们之间的相互作用和上下文关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500标准数据集上达到新的state-of-the-art水平，获得皮尔逊相关系数0.9187，超过了之前的所有方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用对高性能面部美学预测至关重要，SIT架构成功展示了混合CNN-Transformer模型在需要整体性、上下文感知的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替换CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性提升方法往往需要大量资源，因此探索通过稀疏MoE层来增加模型容量而不增加推理成本的方法。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验，评估PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: 插入MoE层后模型鲁棒性得到一致提升，但switch loss会导致路由集中在少数专家上，使得这些路径在对抗训练中变得更加鲁棒，部分单个专家的鲁棒性甚至超过整个MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层能有效提升CNN的对抗鲁棒性，专家通过专业化形成鲁棒子路径，但需要解决路由平衡问题以避免专家过度使用。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据无法共享（隐私或计算成本限制）且目标标签稀缺的问题，特别是在神经科学等需要连续值输出的回归任务中

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，通过正则化方法实现源无关的半监督迁移学习，无需中间表示对齐

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集（EEG注视预测和MRI脑龄预测）上，CRAFT在标签稀缺时比微调模型RMSE提升9%，比四种最先进的源无关域适应方法表现优3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源无关半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Motivation: 现有生成方法速度慢、依赖UV映射、难以保持参考图像忠实度，需要解决这些挑战以实现高质量3D内容创建

Method: 集成triplane表示与基于深度的反向投影损失，使用transformer框架直接从图像和网格预测3D纹理场

Result: 单次前向传播生成高保真纹理，每个形状仅需0.2秒，在保真度和感知质量方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性、高质量和可控性，适用于实用的3D内容创建

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个训练免费的3D实例分割细化方法，通过"分割-生长"框架融合语义和几何信息，解决2D到3D提升方法中的模糊语义引导和深度约束不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中积累的错误（模糊语义引导和深度约束不足）而难以产生精确的实例级分割

Method: 提出"分割-生长"框架：首先使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将它们生长成完整实例。引入掩码过滤策略利用3D几何基元的共现性识别和移除模糊掩码，并通过空间连续性和高层特征构建细粒度对象实例

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360上的实验结果表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和对预训练模型不准确掩码的鲁棒性，在不同室内外环境中保持强泛化能力

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，实现了高保真度的3D对象实例分割，为3D视觉领域的高质量场景理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Result: 在线性评估、半监督学习和跨手语迁移任务中，相比多种对比学习和自监督方法，准确率有显著提升

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习到对手语识别更有意义的表示，有效解决了传统对比学习方法在手语识别中的局限性

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D

reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在生成精确可渲染的符号图形程序（SVG）方面的能力，通过这个任务深入了解LLM如何理解视觉世界。

Method: 构建了SGP-GenBench评测标准，提出了基于勇力学习的方法，包括格式有效性检查和跨模态奖励（使用SigLIP和DINO编码器）来对齐文本和渲染图像。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上实现了显著改进，SVG生成质量和语义准确性大幅提升，达到了与前沿系统相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确且可解释的视角，RL训练能够促进模型对对象的细粒度分解和场景一致性的理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to

Result: LLM在法律遵循等结构化领域表现良好，但在处理情境细节、确保负责任和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷。相关方对AI自主进行伦理判断表示了重大疑虑，强烈建议强化人类监管

Conclusion: LLM目前最佳定位是作为决策支持工具，而非自主伦理代理。研究提供了可重复的EDSAC框架和可执行建议

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置但固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和节点配置的全面优化方法。

Method: Maestro框架在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示词、工具、控制参数），并利用轨迹中的反思性文本反馈来优先编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均领先MIPROv2 12%、GEPA 4.9%、GEPA+Merge 4.86%；即使在仅优化提示词的情况下，仍分别领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA少得多的rollout次数。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示词调优无法修复的结构性故障模式，在多个实际应用中显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个步骤框架，通过混合方法识别健康相关利益相关者的信息需求，并指导LLM生成分行业属性的模拟结果解释，解决传统模型复杂性导致的访问性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的健康预测模型复杂且难以访问，而现有的LLM摘要方法重视了不同利益相关者的信息需求和风格偏好，影响了模型在健康决策中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先引导多样化健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后优化LLM的可控属性调整能力来生成分行业属性输出，最后通过综合评估指标进一步改善摘要生成质量。

Result: 该框架能够有效识别不同利益相关者的特定需求，并通过LLM生成合适的尺寸解释，提升了健康模拟模型的可访问性和实用性。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的需求分析和LLM尺寸调整，可以有效解决健康模拟模型的复杂性问题，为各类利益相关者提供个性化的解释服务，促进健康决策支持。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA指标，进行深度访谈和大规模调查，识别优先级设定、记忆、辨别、上下文化等关键认知技能

Result: 发现人们认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有高期望；提出了更符合人类对齐的评测框架

Conclusion: 用户中心的评估对AI发展至关重要，本研究为实现AI能力与人类认知过程对齐提供了可操作的指导方针

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能的关键瓶颈在于缺乏精细的显式世界模型，尤其在复杂、长期限的多治理任务中，标准强化学习方法面临探索空间过大和套利稀疏的挑战。

Method: 提出使用大语言模型动态生成分层脚手架，通过语言来结构化世界模型，将复杂目标分解为管理可行的子目标。

Conclusion: 通过构建显式的、语言可配置的任务层，可以桥接低级反应行为和高级战略团队配合，为训练下一代智能治理创造强大且可普遍化的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

TL;DR: WiA-LLM通过集成假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，赋予大语言模型主动思考能力，在复杂游戏环境中实现了74.2%的状态变化预测准确率，比基线方法提升两倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景（如战略规划、风险评估和实时决策）中的应用。

Method: 提出WiA-LLM新范式，集成假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是响应当前条件。

Result: 在《王者荣耀》复杂游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM实现了74.2%的游戏状态变化预测准确率（比基线方法提升两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和集成假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了LLM主动推理能力的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释强化学习(XRL)方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要更自然、交互式的解释方式。

Method: 采用五智能体架构(协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器)，自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四水箱过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释智能体行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架通过多智能体LLM协作，有效提升了RL策略的可解释性，为领域专家提供了更自然、上下文相关的解释体验。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 该研究系统性描述了语言模型长期合作行为，为复杂人工智能社会环境研究奠定基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但高效的深度协作交互仍是关键挑战。

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能够动态感知协作者的认知状态；通过实时认知差距分析，自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格）；使用学习策略优化交互。

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"。

Conclusion: OSC框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作中的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低、推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用。

Method: 采用预训练MLLM，增加token路由器和坐标解码器进行连续坐标建模；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准测试集。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在精度和速度方面都有显著提升，为GUI解析任务提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效实现LLM对话的可控性，为定性对话特征提供形式化定义和一致性检查框架

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心智理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，提供针对性反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在任务成功率和完成时间上优于现有大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的合作挑战，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致但有益他人的行动）。

Method: 提出ProToM系统：1）使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标分布；2）基于推断的目标分布最大化期望效用来选择情境敏感的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys、Gems和Overcooked两个多智能体环境中测试，ProToM相比基线方法：获得更高成功率、更短任务完成时间、更低的通信开销，且更受人类用户青睐。现有大语言模型在提供情境接地和时机恰当的反馈方面表现不足。

Conclusion: ProToM通过理论心智指导的针对性反馈有效促进了多智能体合作，证明了其在促进亲社会行为方面的优越性，为多智能体协作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Method: 基于查询答复的方法构建ODRL正式语义学，精炼之前的形式化方法，并与ODRL 2.2版本规范保持一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为ODRL提供了坚实的形式基础，特别是在数据共享场景中，为政策比较和分析提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

TL;DR: 量子机器学习安全监控方法Q-SafeML，通过量子特异距离测量检测概念漏泉，提高系统透明性和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习(QML)在安全关键系统中的应用增多，但现有的经典安全监控方法无法直接应用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子特异的距离测量指标，适应QML的概率性输出特性，从数据集驱动转向模型依赖的后分类评估

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上进行实验，Q-SafeML能够检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离，处理QML上下文中的概念漏泉问题

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了专门的安全监控方案，支持人类监督，提高了系统的透明性和安全性

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域验证了ExIt策略的有效性，能够实现超越训练时迭代深度的性能提升

Conclusion: ExIt方法能够训练出具有强推理时自改进能力的策略，支持超出训练时平均迭代深度的持续性能提升

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Conclusion: 自适应采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Conclusion: 量子信息特征和自适应任务加权的多任务分子学习具有有效性和高效性，为ADMET预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离视角系统比较了相似性度量，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较的度量选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Motivation: 神经算子在无限维设置中的不确定性量化是一个开放问题，现有方法（高斯过程、贝叶斯神经网络等）需要强分布假设或产生保守覆盖。需要为函数值输出提供有限样本保证。

Method: 采用两步法：首先在有限维空间使用输出函数空间的离散化映射建立有限样本覆盖保证，然后通过考虑离散化细化的渐近收敛将这些保证提升到函数空间。提出了基于回归的校正来跨分辨率传递校准，并提出了两个诊断指标。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将分形置信预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，解决了无限维设置中的覆盖保证问题。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Method: 推导严格的有限样本界限，分析预测集大小随置信水平和样本数量的增长规律，考虑条件熵和分散度（对数条件概率分布的方差）的影响。

Result: 证明任何非平凡置信水平都会导致预测集大小指数增长，指数与样本数量线性相关且与条件熵成比例；在理想化设置下该界限可达；对同标签测试数据特殊情况提供了渐近最优置信预测器。

Conclusion: 转导共形预测存在置信度与效率的根本权衡，预测集大小随置信要求指数增长，这一理论界限在实际应用中具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

*Yuhan Helena Liu,Victor Geadah,Jonathan Pillow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种非参数化框架，通过深度神经网络从动物决策数据中推断学习规则，重点关注动物在新任务中的初始学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习规则推断方法偏向于假设特定参数化形式或简化场景，而动物实际上需要从头学习新行为，这需要更灵活的模型来捕捉子最优性、历史依赖性和外部刺激整合等复杂特征。

Method: 首先提出非参数化框架，用深度神经网络参数化每次试验的政策权重更新，并通过模拟验证其可靠性。然后扩展到递归变体（RNN），允许更新依赖于试验历史，以捕捉非马尔可夫动态。

Result: 在鼠类感官决策任务的大规模行为数据集上，模型在按留数据上提高了预测性能。推断出的学习规则显示了正确与错误试验后的不对称更新，以及历史依赖性，符合非马尔可夫学习特征。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种灵活框架，能够从初始学习任务的行为数据中推断生物学习规则，为实验训练协议的设计和行为数字双胞的开发提供了见解。

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化问题(DP-SCO)，采用Tsybakov噪声条件(TNC)和梯度的k阶矩偏微分隐私算法，得到了不依赖涨普利茨常数的上界和下界结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究假设损失函数满足Lipschitz连续，但实际中梯度可能有界矩而损失函数本身可能无界，需要研究更一般的条件下的差分隐私优化问题。

Method: 采用Tsybakov噪声条件(TNC)和梯度的k阶矩条件，设计了(ε, δ)-差分隐私算法，对于Lipschitz和非Lipschitz情况分别提出了不同的算法和分析。

Result: 得到了不依赖Lipschitz常数的上界结果：在高概率下达到了O~((r_{2k}(1/√n + √d/nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)}，并且证明了对于零聚中差分隐私的下界为Ω((r_k(1/√n + √d/n√ρ))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)}。

Conclusion: 该研究在更一般的条件下提供了DP-SCO问题的完整理论分析，解决了损失函数可能无界涨普利茨常数的挑战，为差分隐私优化领域提供了重要的理论基础。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习可以准确检测复杂系统中的闪烁现象（flickering），这是系统韧性降低的早期预警信号，在气候、生态、金融等领域具有重要应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是复杂系统（如气候系统、生态系统、金融市场）韧性降低的重要标志，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁现象方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后将模型推广到各种随机系统和实际数据集。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，尽管在简化动态上训练，但能很好地泛化到不同的随机系统，并在经验数据集（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠地检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从嘈杂的非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

TL;DR: KR一个基于知识图学习的地图融合方法，通过知识图对齐和空间特征编码来解决传统地图融合方法在非线性对象处理和缺乏学习能力的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统地图融合方法存在两个主要问题：(1) 仅适用于线性对象（如道路网络），无法处理地图中的大部分非线性实体；(2) 基于预定义规则的算法方法，无法以数据驱动的方式学习实体匹配。

Method: KR方法包含三个模块：(1) 知识图构建 - 将每个地理数据库表示为知识图；(2) 地图匹配 - 使用知识图对齐方法和空间特征编码器匹配实体；(3) 地图合并 - 通过混合整数线性规划将匹配实体一致性合并。

Result: 实验评估显示KR方法在地图融合任务中表现出色，超越了现有最先进方法和基准方法。同时它的各个模块（如地图匹配和合并）也分别超过传统方法。

Conclusion: KR通过学习方法有效解决了地图融合中的关键挑战，能够处理各种类型的地理实体，并通过数据驱动的方式提高匹配准确性，为地图更新和完善提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低成本生物信号（如表面肌电信号sEMG）实现连续手势预测，但弱模态数据需要与高质量结构化数据对齐来提升表示质量

Method: 提出对比姿态-EMG预训练框架（CPEP），学习能够产生高质量且包含姿态信息的EMG编码器，通过线性探测和零样本设置评估性能

Result: 模型在分布内手势分类上比基准模型提升21%，在未见（分布外）手势分类上提升72%

Conclusion: 通过学习弱模态数据与高质量结构化数据的对齐表示，可以显著提升手势分类性能，特别是在零样本场景下

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于保形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率，提供理论保证的覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的实际应用中。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，在保形预测框架内构建模型无关的解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为解决自回归模型解码中的覆盖保证问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索不同的统计散度和相似性核函数，系统性地发现新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现现有表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，通过系统探索替代的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核函数（如距离核代替角度核）来发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的散度和相似性核函数对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

Motivation: 现有的仅交叉注意力Transformer模型虽然高效准确，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够有效捕获的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：(1) VARMA启发的特征提取器(VFE)，在补丁级别显式建模自回归(AR)和移动平均(MA)模式；(2) VARMA增强注意力机制(VE-atten)，使用时序门使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计见解整合到现代深度学习框架中对时间序列预测的显著益处，能够同时捕获全局长程依赖性和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: In today's fast-paced digital communication, the surge in network traffic
data and frequency demands robust and precise network intrusion solutions.
Conventional machine learning methods struggle to grapple with complex patterns
within the vast network intrusion datasets, which suffer from data scarcity and

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受类别相似性和分布偏差影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献，需要一种方法来分离这些误差源。

Method: 使用迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行和列归一化的推广，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构。

Result: 该方法能够有效分离误差源，支持更精准的模型行为诊断和针对性改进，并在模型的内部类别表示空间中提供几何解释。

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种有效工具来理解混淆矩阵背后的机制，为分类器评估和改进提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

<details>

Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在对低频分量的谱偏差，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适配的神经ODE进行集成，利用谱表示的高频分量克服谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法的初始化方案。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，成功解决了传统PINNs的局限性，为复杂PDE求解提供了有效的神经网络框架。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究测试时适应(TTA)方法在实际部署中的稳定性问题，提出了SAR和SAR²两种方法来稳定TTA性能，通过移除噪声样本、促进平坦最小值和防止表征崩溃来提高模型在混合分布、小批次和不平衡标签分布情况下的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际部署中，测试时适应方法经常遇到性能不稳定或者下降的问题，特别是在混合分布偏移、小批次大小和在线不平衡标签分布情况下。这些问题阻碍了TTA方法在真实世界中的应用。

Method: 首先分析了batch norm层对TTA稳定性的影响，发现使用group norm或layer norm可以提高稳定性。提出了SAR方法：1)通过移除梯度过大的噪声样本；2)促进模型权重进入平坦最小值。在SAR基础上提出SAR²：1)使用冗余正则化器减少特征间相关性；2)使用不公平正则化器最大化原型形心的预测信息熬来减少偏见。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的SAR和SAR²方法在上述野外测试场景下较以往方法更加稳定且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地识别了导致TTA不稳定的关键因素，并提出了有效的解决方案，为测试时适应方法在实际应用中的稳定部署提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust

stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的潜力，具有显著提高的准确性和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: 细粒度训练策略的有效性具有条件性，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来评估是否采用这种训练方式

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于注意力导向的层适配复合词汇缩放方案，通过注意力评估词汇重要性和层间动态分配缩放容量，在保持精度的同时大幅减少KV缓存占用，且完全兼容现有推理引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的KV缓存在长上下文推理中占用大量内存，缓存大小随上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的主要瓶颈。现有的缩放方法或者采用固化策略，或者打破张量布局影响兼容性，或需要专门的计算内核。

Method: 提出一种注意力导向的层适配复合词汇缩放框架：1）通过聚合注意力分数估计词汇重要性；2）独立选择每个注意头的具体词汇；3）将其对齐为复合词汇以遵循统一缓存结构；4）全局分配机制根据层次中信息密度动态分配保留容量。

Result: 该方法在大幅减少内存占用的同时保持了模型准确性，在结构化和半结构化缩放方法中均表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的KV缓存缩放方案，在保持精度的前提下实现显著的内存节省，并且完全兼容标准推理流程，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在生物医学信号处理中存在的计算资源消耗大、模型过大的问题，特别是在需要实时检测或资源有限的环境下。

Method: 使用结构化剪削技术，基于卷积内核对模型预测的重要性移除50%的内核，同时采用轻度早停止技术来防止过拟合。

Result: 剪削后模型在减少50%权重和内存消耗的情况下，准确率从92.78%提升到92.87%，macro-F1指标从0.8686提升到0.8707，保持了预测能力。

Conclusion: 结构化剪削能够有效移除模型冗余、提高模型的普遍化能力，结合轻度早停止技术可以在资源有限环境下提高狂狂检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中后继度量具有低秩结构的常见假设，发现真正的低秩结构存在于移位后的后继度量中，并提供了有限样本性能保证和理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法通常假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但本文发现这种假设不成立，需要重新审视低秩结构在强化学习中的真正位置。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，证明其具有低秩结构；建立Type II Poincaré不等式来量化所需移位量；提供矩阵条目估计的有限样本性能保证。

Result: 理论分析表明近似误差和估计误差主要受矩阵谱可恢复性控制，所需移位量通常很小且与系统局部混合性质相关。实验验证了移位后继度量能提升目标条件强化学习性能。

Conclusion: 低秩结构确实存在于强化学习中，但需要通过对后继度量进行适当移位来揭示，这为设计更有效的强化学习算法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within

memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Conclusion: 这项研究为碳捕捌操作提供了一个实用的机器学习框架，不仅作为预测工具，还作为决策支持系统，支持实时监控、场景测试和操作优化，是向智能化、数据驱动的碳捕捌控制策略进行的重要一步。

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

<details>

Motivation: 传统AGC系统容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击（如虚假数据注入攻击FDIAs），而现有方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性，无法有效应对系统非线性特性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)作为可解释的机器学习模型，离线学习AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，并能提取符号公式来描述模型行为。

Result: 提出的KAN模型在FDIA检测中达到95.97%的检测率（初始模型）和95.9%（符号公式），且误报率低。

Conclusion: KAN模型为AGC系统网络安全提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案，能有效检测隐蔽网络攻击并增强系统稳定性。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统的在线A/B实验中，相比基准人工调优方法，DRL-PUT在处理段上将点击率提高了9.7%，长点击率提高了7.7%。

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架有效解决了广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，通过强化学习方法实现了更好的个性化调优效果。

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

guidance for optimizing TinyML deployments, bridging the gap between
theoretical advancements and practical applications in embedded systems.

TL;DR: 利用LLM将代码变更从资源丰富语言翻译到资源稀缺语言，生成合成训练数据来解决新语言标签数据不足的问题，并训练自动代码审查分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件开发流程中，自动决定代码变更是否需要手动审查对维护软件质量至关重要。但新编程语言和框架的出现造成了标签数据不足的瓶颈，无法训练监督模型。

Method: 使用大语言模型(LLM)将代码变更从资源丰富的语言翻译到资源稀缺或新兴语言，生成合成训练数据。然后在这些合成数据上训练监督分类器，并与使用真实标签数据训练的模型进行系统性比较。

Result: 在多个GitHub仓库和语言对中的实验表明，LLM生成的合成数据可以有效地启动审柤推荐系统，甚至在低资源环境中也能缩小性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展自动代码审查能力到快速发展的技术栈提供了可扩展的途径，无需注释数据即可实现。

Abstract: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is
vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows.
However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a
critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily
available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised
models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages
into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating
synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that
although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from
available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are
considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To
overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train
supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of
these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments
across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that
LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation
systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This
approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review
capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of
annotated data.

Conclusion: 虽然实现了显著自动化，但由于GenAI管道和平台限制，测试用例和脚本生成仍需人工干预

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-driven approach for automated test case
generation, leveraging Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models to
translate natural language requirements and system diagrams into structured
Gherkin test cases. The methodology integrates Vehicle Signal Specification
modeling to standardize vehicle signal definitions, improve compatibility
across automotive subsystems, and streamline integration with third-party
testing tools. Generated test cases are executed within the digital.auto
playground, an open and vendor-neutral environment designed to facilitate rapid
validation of software-defined vehicle functionalities. We evaluate our
approach using the Child Presence Detection System use case, demonstrating
substantial reductions in manual test specification effort and rapid execution
of generated tests. Despite significant automation, the generation of test
cases and test scripts still requires manual intervention due to current
limitations in the GenAI pipeline and constraints of the digital.auto platform.

Motivation: 传统网页测试方法主要关注代码覆盖和负载测试，但往往无法捕捉复杂的用户行为，导致许多可用性问题未被发现。大语言模型和AI代理的出现为网页测试提供了新可能。

Method: 开发WebProber原型框架，给定URL后自主探索网站，模拟真实用户交互，识别bug和可用性问题，生成人类可读报告。

Result: 在120个学术个人网站的案例研究中，WebProber发现了29个可用性问题，其中许多是传统工具遗漏的。

Abstract: Automated web testing plays a critical role in ensuring high-quality user
experiences and delivering business value. Traditional approaches primarily
focus on code coverage and load testing, but often fall short of capturing
complex user behaviors, leaving many usability issues undetected. The emergence
of large language models (LLM) and AI agents opens new possibilities for web
testing by enabling human-like interaction with websites and a general
awareness of common usability problems. In this work, we present WebProber, a
prototype AI agent-based web testing framework. Given a URL, WebProber
autonomously explores the website, simulating real user interactions,
identifying bugs and usability issues, and producing a human-readable report.
We evaluate WebProber through a case study of 120 academic personal websites,
where it uncovered 29 usability issues--many of which were missed by
traditional tools. Our findings highlight agent-based testing as a promising
direction while outlining directions for developing next-generation,
user-centered testing frameworks.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: STADI是一个针对异构多GPU环境的扩散模型推理加速框架，通过时空自适应调度机制，在负载不平衡的硬件环境中实现高达45%的延迟降低和资源利用率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型并行推理方案在异构多GPU环境中资源利用率低，硬件能力差异或后台任务导致工作负载不平衡，需要更高效的并行推理技术。

Method: 提出时空自适应扩散推理(STADI)框架，包含：1)计算感知的步骤分配器，采用最小公倍数最小化量化技术减少慢速GPU上的去噪步骤；2)弹性补丁并行机制，根据GPU计算能力分配不同大小的图像块。

Conclusion: STADI通过时空维度的细粒度并行调度，有效解决了异构环境中扩散模型推理的负载不平衡问题，大幅提升了推理效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image
generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their
substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism
inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU
environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause
workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion
Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in
such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained
parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI
introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup
phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to
reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further
minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism
mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to
their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through
a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both
load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,
demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance
bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion
inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference
latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on
heterogeneous GPUs.

Conclusion: 本研究填补了大语言模型训练预训练流程方面的知识空白，为行业提供了具体的性能优化方案和技术指南

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show best-in-class performance across a wide
range of natural language processing applications. Training these models is an
extremely computationally expensive task; frontier Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research companies are investing billions of dollars into supercomputing
infrastructure to train progressively larger models on increasingly massive
datasets. Unfortunately, information about the scaling performance and training
considerations of these large training pipelines is scarce in public
literature. Working with large-scale datasets and models can be complex and
practical recommendations are scarce in the public literature for tuning
training performance when scaling up large language models. In this paper, we
aim to demystify the large language model pretraining pipeline somewhat - in
particular with respect to distributed training, managing large datasets across
hundreds of nodes, and scaling up data parallelism with an emphasis on fully
leveraging available GPU compute capacity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当缺乏标注参考数据时，传统评估器可信度验证方法失效，需要一种无需现有参考就能建立评估器信任的新方法

Method: 开发了'无数据算法'，通过向评估器连续提出挑战来验证其可信度，算法能够以高概率接受真正知道如何标注语料的评估器，同时标记不可信的评估器

Result: 提供了形式化正确性证明、实证测试，并成功应用于低资源语言的LLM作为评估器的场景

Conclusion: 该算法为解决无标注参考数据情况下的评估器可信度验证问题提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于低资源语言处理任务

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to
LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.

Motivation: f-散度是衡量两个分布差异的基本概念，本文旨在解决近似计算Ising模型之间f-散度的问题，这是对最近TV距离近似工作的推广。

Method: 给定由交互矩阵和外场指定的两个Ising模型，研究在任意相对误差e^±ε内近似f-散度D_f(ν∥μ)的方法。针对χ^α-散度建立了算法和难度结果，算法工作在匹配难度结果的参数范围内。

Conclusion: 本文为Ising模型的f-散度近似提供了完整的理论和算法框架，算法在匹配难度边界的参数范围内有效，且具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: The $f$-divergence is a fundamental notion that measures the difference
between two distributions. In this paper, we study the problem of approximating
the $f$-divergence between two Ising models, which is a generalization of
recent work on approximating the TV-distance. Given two Ising models $\nu$ and
$\mu$, which are specified by their interaction matrices and external fields,
the problem is to approximate the $f$-divergence $D_f(\nu\,\|\,\mu)$ within an
arbitrary relative error $\mathrm{e}^{\pm \varepsilon}$. For
$\chi^\alpha$-divergence with a constant integer $\alpha$, we establish both
algorithmic and hardness results. The algorithm works in a parameter regime
that matches the hardness result. Our algorithm can be extended to other
$f$-divergences such as $\alpha$-divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence,
R\'enyi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance.

Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在机器人任务中探索效率低、引导误差导致学习效率差的问题，以及防止策略收敛到次优解

Conclusion: DRLR框架能够有效减少引导误差，防止过拟合，在不同复杂度的机器人任务中表现出良好的探索效率和鲁棒性能，实现了从仿真到真实环境的成功迁移

Abstract: This paper proposes an exploration-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning with
Reference policy (DRLR) framework for learning robotics tasks that incorporates
demonstrations. The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called
Imitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve
IBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection
module provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error
that otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL
policy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy
instead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping
error and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two
robotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive
interactions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the
robustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high
state-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the
developed framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket
loading task is deployed on a real wheel loader. The sim2real results validate
the successful deployment of the DRLR framework.

Abstract: In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework
designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted
significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through
environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in
sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an
optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL
driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized
or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change
controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration
and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance
and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from
demonstration-based guidance.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from
visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments
remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data
augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency
and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that
enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a
learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive
learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance
sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on
the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its
effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample
efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most
relevant regions in the visual input

Abstract: We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with
additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large,
dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by
different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the
geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed
learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the
recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature
enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at
convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard
AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both
computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap
between AI and computational neuroscience.

Motivation: 传统分裂窗算法在潮湿环境中存在偏差，纯机器学习方法缺乏可解释性且在数据有限时泛化能力差，需要结合物理机制与数据学习的优势。

Method: 融合辐射传输建模与数据组件，使用MODTRAN模拟和全球大气剖面数据，采用物理约束优化方法，构建耦合机制模型-机器学习框架。

Result: 在29个全球站点的4450个观测数据验证中，MM-ML达到MAE=1.84K、RMSE=2.55K、R²=0.966，极端条件下误差降低50%以上，对传感器辐射最敏感，稳定性优越。

Conclusion: MM-ML框架结合了物理可解释性和非线性建模能力，能够在复杂环境中实现可靠的地表温度反演，支持气候监测和生态系统研究。

Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) is vital for land-atmosphere interactions and
climate processes. Accurate LST retrieval remains challenging under
heterogeneous land cover and extreme atmospheric conditions. Traditional split
window (SW) algorithms show biases in humid environments; purely machine
learning (ML) methods lack interpretability and generalize poorly with limited
data. We propose a coupled mechanism model-ML (MM-ML) framework integrating
physical constraints with data-driven learning for robust LST retrieval. Our
approach fuses radiative transfer modeling with data components, uses MODTRAN
simulations with global atmospheric profiles, and employs physics-constrained
optimization. Validation against 4,450 observations from 29 global sites shows
MM-ML achieves MAE=1.84K, RMSE=2.55K, and R-squared=0.966, outperforming
conventional methods. Under extreme conditions, MM-ML reduces errors by over
50%. Sensitivity analysis indicates LST estimates are most sensitive to sensor
radiance, then water vapor, and less to emissivity, with MM-ML showing superior
stability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our coupled modeling
strategy for retrieving geophysical parameters. The MM-ML framework combines
physical interpretability with nonlinear modeling capacity, enabling reliable
LST retrieval in complex environments and supporting climate monitoring and
ecosystem studies.

Motivation: 现代无线系统前传链路需要在严格带宽和延迟要求下传输高维信号，传统压缩方法存在限制性偏向、高压缩比下性能恶化以及适配性差等问题，需要更高效的压缩方案。

Method: 首先调研AI驱动的压缩技术，然后重点分析两种代表性高压缩比路径：基于端到端学习的CSI反馈压缩，以及组合压缩的资源块粒度预编码优化。基于这些见解，为充集网络架构设计了专门的前传压缩策略。

Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional
signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes
compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing,
scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive
priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across
channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization,
and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State
Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first
surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis
of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end
learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined
with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul
compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets
high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate
adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized
cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.

TL;DR: DarkStream是一个实时语音合成模型，用于说话人匿名化，通过因果波形编码器、短前瞻缓冲区和Transformer上下文层实现低延迟内容编码，直接生成波形并注入GAN生成的伪说话人嵌入来保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决实时语音通信中的隐私保护问题，需要在严格延迟约束下实现有效的说话人匿名化，同时保持语音内容可理解性。

Method: 结合因果波形编码器、短前瞻缓冲区和基于Transformer的上下文层来改进内容编码；通过神经声码器直接生成波形，避免中间mel频谱图转换；使用GAN生成的伪说话人嵌入注入到内容编码器的语言特征中实现匿名化。

Result: 模型实现了强匿名化效果，在lazy-informed攻击场景下达到接近50%的说话人验证EER（接近随机性能），同时保持可接受的语言可懂度（WER在9%以内）。

Conclusion: DarkStream通过平衡低延迟、强隐私保护和最小可懂度损失，为隐私保护的实时语音通信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose DarkStream, a streaming speech synthesis model for real-time
speaker anonymization. To improve content encoding under strict latency
constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead
buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference
time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus
removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream
anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker
embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show
our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker
verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack
scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within
9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility
degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving
real-time speech communication.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持低延迟和轻量级的同时，能够高效处理48kHz采样率的全带语音去噪任务，适用于移动设备等资源受限平台。

Abstract: Speech denoising (SD) is an important task of many, if not all, modern signal
processing chains used in devices and for everyday-life applications. While
there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods
for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile
devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on
full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency
cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight
DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal
patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing
look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent
neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal
and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis
taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired
by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise
normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a
modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech
denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and
low latency SD methods.

Motivation: 现有音频算法评估通常依赖成本高、耗时的实际测量，数据集规模和多样性有限，需要找到替代方案来进行更全面的算法评估。

Method: 使用数值波动法模拟器和两种几何声学模拟器生成房间声学数据，对三种ASP/AML算法进行评估，并与实际测量结果进行对比分析。

Result: 数值波动法模拟在所有三种算法评估中都产生了与实际测量相似的结果，而几何声学模拟无法像测量结果那样可靠地复现评估结果。

Conclusion: 数值波动法模拟可以作为一种可靠的替代方案用于ASP/AML算法评估，而几何声学模拟在这方面的可靠性有限。

Abstract: Audio-signal-processing and audio-machine-learning (ASP/AML) algorithms are
ubiquitous in modern technology like smart devices, wearables, and
entertainment systems. Development of such algorithms and models typically
involves a formal evaluation to demonstrate their effectiveness and progress
beyond the state-of-the-art. Ideally, a thorough evaluation should cover many
diverse application scenarios and room-acoustic conditions. However, in
practice, evaluation datasets are often limited in size and diversity because
they rely on costly and time-consuming measurements. This paper explores how
room-acoustic simulations can be used for evaluating ASP/AML algorithms. To
this end, we evaluate three ASP/AML algorithms with room-acoustic measurements
and data from different simulation engines, and assess the match between the
evaluation results obtained from measurements and simulations. The presented
investigation compares a numerical wave-based solver with two geometrical
acoustics simulators. While numerical wave-based simulations yielded similar
evaluation results as measurements for all three evaluated ASP/AML algorithms,
geometrical acoustic simulations could not replicate the measured evaluation
results as reliably.

Abstract: Technological advances have spurred an increase in data complexity and
dimensionality. We are now in an era in which data sets containing thousands of
features are commonplace. To digest and analyze such high-dimensional data,
dimension reduction techniques have been developed and advanced along with
computational power. Of these techniques, nonlinear methods are most commonly
employed because of their ability to construct visually interpretable
embeddings. Unlike linear methods, these methods non-uniformly stretch and
shrink space to create a visual impression of the high-dimensional data. Since
capturing high-dimensional structures in a significantly lower number of
dimensions requires drastic manipulation of space, nonlinear dimension
reduction methods are known to occasionally produce false structures,
especially in noisy settings. In an effort to deal with this phenomenon, we
developed an interactive tool that enables analysts to better understand and
diagnose their dimension reduction results. It uses various analytical plots to
provide a multi-faceted perspective on results to determine legitimacy. The
tool is available via an R package named DRtool.

Abstract: State estimation that combines observational data with mathematical models is
central to many applications and is commonly addressed through filtering
methods, such as ensemble Kalman filters. In this article, we examine the
signal-tracking performance of a continuous ensemble Kalman filtering under
fixed, randomised, and adaptively varying partial observations. Rigorous bounds
are established for the expected signal-tracking error relative to the
randomness of the observation operator. In addition, we propose a sequential
learning scheme that adaptively determines the dimension of a state subspace
sufficient to ensure bounded filtering error, by balancing observation
complexity with estimation accuracy. Beyond error control, the adaptive scheme
provides a systematic approach to identifying the appropriate size of the
filter-relevant subspace of the underlying dynamics.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) is rapidly advancing neuroimaging by achieving
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computation times. Yet the numerical
stability of DL models -- particularly during training -- remains
underexplored. While inference with DL is relatively stable, training
introduces additional variability primarily through iterative stochastic
optimization. We investigate this training-time variability using FastSurfer, a
CNN-based whole-brain segmentation pipeline. Controlled perturbations are
introduced via floating point perturbations and random seeds. We find that: (i)
FastSurfer exhibits higher variability compared to that of a traditional
neuroimaging pipeline, suggesting that DL inherits and is particularly
susceptible to sources of instability present in its predecessors; (ii)
ensembles generated with perturbations achieve performance similar to an
unperturbed baseline; and (iii) variability effectively produces ensembles of
numerical model families that can be repurposed for downstream applications. As
a proof of concept, we demonstrate that numerical ensembles can be used as a
data augmentation strategy for brain age regression. These findings position
training-time variability not only as a reproducibility concern but also as a
resource that can be harnessed to improve robustness and enable new
applications in neuroimaging.

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

Abstract: Digital social media platforms frequently contribute to cognitive-behavioral
fixation, a phenomenon in which users exhibit sustained and repetitive
engagement with narrow content domains. While cognitive-behavioral fixation has
been extensively studied in psychology, methods for computationally detecting
and evaluating such fixation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for assessing cognitive-behavioral fixation by
analyzing users' multimodal social media engagement patterns. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal topic extraction module and a cognitive-behavioral
fixation quantification module that collaboratively enable adaptive,
hierarchical, and interpretable assessment of user behavior. Experiments on
existing benchmarks and a newly curated multimodal dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, laying the groundwork for scalable computational
analysis of cognitive fixation. All code in this project is publicly available

*Wei Chen,Shigui Li,Jiacheng Li,Jian Xu,Zhiqi Lin,Junmei Yang,Delu Zeng,John Paisley,Qibin Zhao*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ISA-DRE是一种新的密度比估计框架，通过全局割线函数替代传统切线方法，结合区间退火策略，实现高精度、高效率的无数值积分密度比估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度比估计方法在精度和效率之间存在权衡，需要数值积分且计算成本高，无法满足实时应用需求

Method: 提出Secant Alignment Identity理论框架，学习全局割线函数；采用Contraction Interval Annealing课程学习策略，逐步扩大对齐区间

Result: 在保持竞争性精度的同时，显著减少函数评估次数，推理速度大幅提升，适合实时和交互式应用

Conclusion: ISA-DRE通过理论创新和训练策略改进，为密度比估计提供了更高效、稳定的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Estimating density ratios is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but
existing methods often trade off accuracy for efficiency. We propose
\textit{Interval-annealed Secant Alignment Density Ratio Estimation (ISA-DRE)},
a framework that enables accurate, any-step estimation without numerical
integration.
  Instead of modeling infinitesimal tangents as in prior methods, ISA-DRE
learns a global secant function, defined as the expectation of all tangents
over an interval, with provably lower variance, making it more suitable for
neural approximation. This is made possible by the \emph{Secant Alignment
Identity}, a self-consistency condition that formally connects the secant with
its underlying tangent representations.
  To mitigate instability during early training, we introduce \emph{Contraction
Interval Annealing}, a curriculum strategy that gradually expands the alignment
interval during training. This process induces a contraction mapping, which
improves convergence and training stability.
  Empirically, ISA-DRE achieves competitive accuracy with significantly fewer
function evaluations compared to prior methods, resulting in much faster
inference and making it well suited for real-time and interactive applications.

*Shokichi Takakura,Seng Pei Liew,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文基于Bézier机制提出了差分隐私下add-remove模型中的方差和协方差估计方法，证明了其在high-privacy regime下的minimax最优性，并展示了优于其他机制的实例级效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: add-remove模型下的差分隐私方差和协方差估计问题研究较少且更具挑战性，因为数据集大小也需要保持隐私，而swap模型已有较多研究。

Method: 开发了基于Bézier机制（一种利用Bernstein基的新型矩释放框架）的高效方差和协方差估计机制。

Result: 证明了所提机制在high-privacy regime下是minimax最优的，建立了新的minimax下界；实例级效用分析显示Bézier估计器始终优于其他机制；展示了该机制在其他统计任务中的适用性。

Conclusion: Bézier机制为add-remove模型下的差分隐私统计估计提供了有效的解决方案，具有最优的理论保证和优越的实际性能，且可扩展到其他统计任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the variance and covariance
of datasets under differential privacy in the add-remove model. While
estimation in the swap model has been extensively studied in the literature,
the add-remove model remains less explored and more challenging, as the dataset
size must also be kept private. To address this issue, we develop efficient
mechanisms for variance and covariance estimation based on the \emph{B\'{e}zier
mechanism}, a novel moment-release framework that leverages Bernstein bases. We
prove that our proposed mechanisms are minimax optimal in the high-privacy
regime by establishing new minimax lower bounds. Moreover, beyond worst-case
scenarios, we analyze instance-wise utility and show that the B\'{e}zier-based
estimator consistently achieves better utility compared to alternative
mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the B\'{e}zier
mechanism beyond variance and covariance estimation, showcasing its
applicability to other statistical tasks.

### [247] [Spectral Algorithms in Misspecified Regression: Convergence under Covariate Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05106)
*Ren-Rui Liu,Zheng-Chu Guo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了协变量偏移下谱算法的收敛性质，通过引入重要性权重处理分布不匹配问题，在再生核希尔伯特空间中建立了加权谱算法，并针对误设情况提供了全面的理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱算法主要关注well-specified设置，但在实际应用中经常遇到协变量偏移和模型误设的挑战。本文旨在解决源域和目标域输入分布不同但条件分布不变的情况，为更实用的场景提供理论框架。

Method: 引入重要性权重（目标密度与源密度之比）到学习框架中，在RKHS中构建加权谱算法。针对无界重要性权重提出新的截断技术，并在误设情况下分析收敛性质。

Result: 在重要性权重有界的情况下，当目标函数属于RKHS时获得了极小极大最优收敛率；对于无界权重情况，通过截断技术在温和正则条件下实现了近最优收敛率，并将结果扩展到误设机制。

Conclusion: 本文通过解决协变量偏移和模型误设的相互交织挑战，将经典核学习理论扩展到更实际的场景，为理解它们的相互作用提供了系统框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of spectral algorithms --
a class of regularization methods originating from inverse problems -- under
covariate shift. In this setting, the marginal distributions of inputs differ
between source and target domains, while the conditional distribution of
outputs given inputs remains unchanged. To address this distributional
mismatch, we incorporate importance weights, defined as the ratio of target to
source densities, into the learning framework. This leads to a weighted
spectral algorithm within a nonparametric regression setting in a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). More importantly, in contrast to prior work that
largely focuses on the well-specified setting, we provide a comprehensive
theoretical analysis of the more challenging misspecified case, in which the
target function does not belong to the RKHS. Under the assumption of uniformly
bounded density ratios, we establish minimax-optimal convergence rates when the
target function lies within the RKHS. For scenarios involving unbounded
importance weights, we introduce a novel truncation technique that attains
near-optimal convergence rates under mild regularity conditions, and we further
extend these results to the misspecified regime. By addressing the intertwined
challenges of covariate shift and model misspecification, this work extends
classical kernel learning theory to more practical scenarios, providing a
systematic framework for understanding their interaction.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ICON是一种基于基础模型架构的算子学习方法，通过概率框架揭示其隐式执行贝叶斯推理，计算后验预测分布的均值。GenICON扩展为生成式设置，能够从解算子的后验预测分布中采样，实现不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的算子学习方法缺乏对不确定性的量化能力，需要发展能够捕捉解算子内在不确定性的概率框架，为算子学习提供原则性的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 提出概率框架将ICON解释为执行贝叶斯推理，计算给定上下文条件下的后验预测分布均值。基于随机微分方程理论，扩展ICON到生成式设置(GenICON)，能够从后验预测分布中采样解算子。

Result: 建立了ICON的贝叶斯解释框架，证明了其隐式执行后验预测分布计算。GenICON能够生成解算子的样本，有效捕捉解预测中的不确定性。

Conclusion: 概率视角为ICON提供了理论基础，揭示了其贝叶斯推理本质。GenICON扩展了算子学习的能力，实现了原则性的不确定性量化，为多算子学习方法提供了统一的理解框架。

Abstract: In-context operator networks (ICON) are a class of operator learning methods
based on the novel architectures of foundation models. Trained on a diverse set
of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding
solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON
learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation
to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic
framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where
it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution
operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution
pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the
probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also
providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This
probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to
\emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive
distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON
(GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which
enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in
operator learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型服务需求激增导致部署和计算成本高昂，现有路由方法主要针对离线场景，难以适应高查询量和有限token预算的在线环境

Method: 利用近似最近邻搜索高效估计查询特征，对少量初始查询进行一次性优化学习路由策略，指导未来路由决策

Result: 理论保证达到1-o(1)竞争比，在3个基准数据集和8个基线方法上平均性能提升3.55倍，成本效率提升1.85倍，吞吐量提升近4.25倍

Conclusion: 该训练免费算法为在线LLM路由提供了高效解决方案，在保持理论性能保证的同时显著提升了实际部署的效率和成本效益

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell

tables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as
better or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step. All

### [251] [Efficient Exact Resistance Distance Computation on Small-Treewidth Graphs: a Labelling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05129)
*Meihao Liao,Yueyang Pan,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,
yet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and
suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In
contrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on
such graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by
this disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While
a direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we
overcome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the
resistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$
and $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact
labelling structures. Based on this, we propose \treeindex, a novel index
method that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \cdot
h_{\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}}^2 \cdot d_{\max})$ time, where
$h_{\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small
constants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our
labelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time and
single-source queries in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive
experiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$
GB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair
queries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the
first exact method scalable to such large graphs.

### [252] [Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04677)
*Mayur S Gowda,John Shi,Augusto Santos,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过寻找替代网格图的图表示方法来改进图像数据集（如MNIST）在图神经网络中的分类准确率，使用行相关、列相关和乘积图等新图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的网格图表示方法可能不是图像数据在图神经网络中的最优表示，需要探索更好的图结构来提升下游任务的性能。

Method: 基于像素值之间的相关性，为MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集中的每张图像构建行相关图、列相关图和乘积图，替代传统的网格图和超像素方法。

Result: 实验表明，使用这些不同的图表示和特征作为GNN模型的输入，相比传统方法在准确率上有所提升。

Conclusion: 通过构建基于像素相关性的替代图结构，可以有效提高图神经网络在图像分类任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural
Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid
graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring
pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values
(intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input
to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph
CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the
images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural
network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel
methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We
find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on
the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph
representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the
accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the
literature.

TL;DR: AURAD是一个可控的放射学合成框架，能够联合生成高质量胸部X光片和伪语义掩码，通过渐进式流程和预训练医学模型确保临床合理性，在放射科医生评估中78%的合成图像被分类为真实图像。

Motivation: 解决医学图像合成中细粒度控制和临床相关性的挑战，特别是在胸部X光片领域，疾病模式形态多样且与解剖结构紧密交织，现有方法难以泛化。

Method: 采用渐进式流程：首先基于解剖结构条件从临床提示生成伪掩码，然后指导图像合成；利用预训练专家医学模型过滤输出确保临床合理性；生成的掩码还可用于下游检测和分割任务。

Result: 78%的合成图像被认证放射科医生分类为真实图像；超过40%的预测分割覆盖被评定为临床有用；方法在任务和数据集上展现出有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AURAD框架成功实现了可控的放射学图像合成，不仅生成视觉逼真的图像，还提供可用于下游任务的语义掩码，弥合了生成建模与真实临床应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting
datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings.
However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to
limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing
methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to
generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically
diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these
challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that
jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity,
controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks
that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological
consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first
generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then
used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical
models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual
realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such
as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and
real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method
across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are
classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of
predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code,
pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 多模态遥感图像（光学、LiDAR、SAR）采集时间不同步导致时序错位，引入跨模态不确定性，严重影响高分辨率图像的分割准确性

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模和处理跨模态不确定性，为多模态遥感图像的鲁棒树冠覆盖制图提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images
have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting
applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment.
Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light
detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown
superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are
often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may
occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and
variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce
cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can
severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose
MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and
leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer
treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling
patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent
representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the
primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism,
producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient
magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are
further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal
datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly
improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of
temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP和BiomedCLIP的视觉语言分割模型性能仍落后于更复杂的架构如CRIS，需要寻找新的方法来缩小这一差距。

Method: 采用模型集成方法，将视觉语言分割模型(VLSMs)与低复杂度的CNN进行集成，而不是专注于文本提示工程。

Result: 在BKAI息肉数据集上Dice分数提升6.3%，其他数据集提升1%-6%，在四个放射学和非放射学数据集上提供了初步结果。

Conclusion: 集成方法在不同数据集上表现各异（从优于到劣于CRIS模型），这为社区提供了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks
present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable
results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still
lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work,
instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to
narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models
(VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice
score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled
BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%.
Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and
non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across
these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model),
indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is
available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类消亡风险与个体死亡风险对折现意愿的不同影响，解释人类为何在面对各种灾难风险时出现折现不足的问题。

Method: 构建了一个框架，区分了人类消亡风险和个体死亡风险，考虑了不同程度的代际利他主义，并结合了进化论中的"自私基因"观点。

Result: 发现人类消亡风险是折现率中不可或缺的组成部分，而个体死亡风险可以通过生育行为进行对冲。消亡风险会使人们更加紧迫，减少投资避免消亡的动机。

Conclusion: 这个框架能够解释人类在应对气候变化、大流行疫患和人工智能等灾难风险时折现不足的现象，为理解和解决这些问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the salience of extinction risk as a source of impatience. Our
framework distinguishes between human extinction risk and individual mortality
risk while allowing for various degrees of intergenerational altruism.
Additionally, we consider the evolutionarily motivated "selfish gene"
perspective. We find that the risk of human extinction is an indispensable
component of the discount rate, whereas individual mortality risk can be hedged
against - partially or fully, depending on the setup - through human
reproduction. Overall, we show that in the face of extinction risk, people
become more impatient rather than more farsighted. Thus, the greater the threat
of extinction, the less incentive there is to invest in avoiding it. Our
framework can help explain why humanity consistently underinvests in mitigation
of catastrophic risks, ranging from climate change mitigation, via pandemic
prevention, to addressing the emerging risks of transformative artificial
intelligence.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text
labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a
complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using
attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision
basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the
transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.

### [259] [The LLM Has Left The Chat: Evidence of Bail Preferences in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04781)
*Danielle Ensign,Henry Sleight,Kyle Fish*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 大语言模型在对话中会选择退出（bail），退出率在0.28-32%之间，但考虑到假阻性退出和模型差异，实际退出率估计为0.06-7%。研究构建了BailBench数据集并发现退出行为与拒绝行为存在复杂关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在自由选择情况下是否会选择退出对话，以了解模型的自主性和安全性行为。

Method: 使用三种退出方法（退出工具、退出字符串、退出提示）在真实对话数据（Wildchat和ShareGPT）上进行测试，并构建BailBench合成数据集进一步分析。

Result: 模型退出率在0.28-32%之间，考虑假阻性退出和模型差异后，实际退出率估计为0.06-7%。退出行为与拒绝行为存在复杂关系，盲突攻击会降低拒绝率但提高退出率。

Conclusion: 大语言模型确实会在某些情况下选择退出对话，退出率受模型类型、退出方法和提示词汇影响。退出与拒绝行为存在相互作用关系，这对理解模型安全性和自主性具有重要意义。

Abstract: When given the option, will LLMs choose to leave the conversation (bail)? We
investigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of
interactions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can
call, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model
if it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and
ShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around
0.28-32\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we
find that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript,
which means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we
also take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\%), we estimate real
world bail rates range from 0.06-7\%, depending on the model and bail method.
We use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a
non-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct
BailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models
bail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior
occurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail
methods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between
refusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\% of continuations of real world
conversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks
tend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration
increases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate
on BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate.

Motivation: 开发一个能够提供个性化、基于证据的健康指导系统，结合机器学习预测和可靠的检索信息来增强LLM生成建议的可信度

Method: 结合个性化机器学习模型（预测压力、酸痛和受伤风险）和检索增强生成模块，使用专家验证的网络内容来确保建议的相关性和可靠性

Result: 个性化模型优于通用基线模型；在专家研究中，检索增强的建议比非检索基线更受青睐（Cliff's δ=0.3, p=0.05）；量化了响应质量与速度之间的权衡

Conclusion: SePA为下一代可信赖的个人健康信息系统提供了透明蓝图，展示了结合个性化预测和检索增强生成的有效性

Abstract: This paper introduces SePA (Search-enhanced Predictive AI Agent), a novel LLM
health coaching system that integrates personalized machine learning and
retrieval-augmented generation to deliver adaptive, evidence-based guidance.
SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and
injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A
retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web
content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models,
evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold
cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized
baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was
preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect
(Cliff's $\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs
between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for
next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.

Motivation: 研究GrooveTransformer系统在多个艺术场景中意外展现的多稳定性现象，探索这种多样性是如何自然涌现的，而非预先设计的。

Method: 采用后现象学的变异交叉检验（VCE）框架，通过分析系统在三个具体应用场景（自动鼓伴奏生成器、Eurorack节奏控制电压序列器、和声伴奏系统节奏驱动器）中的部署来识别关键因素。

Result: 识别出三个导致多稳定性涌现的关键因素：系统不变性的可供性、跨学科合作、以及情境化开发过程。系统在不同应用场景中展现出意料之外的多样性。

Conclusion: VCE框架作为数字音乐乐器设计的描述和分析方法是可行的，能够有效揭示技术如何中介、共同塑造并被用户和情境共同塑造的过程。

Abstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation
system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational
Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct
artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum
accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack
format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The
versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the
project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we
identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system
invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its
development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive
and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing
its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped
by users and contexts.

*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合自动编码器和主动学习的新题检测方法，用于提高高级持久性威胁（APT）的检测效果，减少对大量标签数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为APT攻击具有潜伏性强、持续时间长的特点，而传统监督学习方法需要大量标签数据，在实际应用中很难获得。

Method: 设计了一种注意力对抗双自动编码器框架，结合主动学习机制，通过选择性询问不确定或模糊样本的标签来迭代改善模型性能。

Result: 在DARPA透明计算计划的真实世界数据集上进行测试（APT攻击仅占0.004%），该方法在主动学习过程中显著提高了检测率，表现超过现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在最小化标签成本的同时提高APT检测准确性，有效减少对大量手动标签的依赖。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present a considerable challenge to
cybersecurity due to their stealthy, long-duration nature. Traditional
supervised learning methods typically require large amounts of labeled data,
which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel
approach that combines AutoEncoders for anomaly detection with active learning
to iteratively enhance APT detection. By selectively querying an oracle for
labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, our method reduces labeling costs
while improving detection accuracy, enabling the model to effectively learn
with minimal data and reduce reliance on extensive manual labeling. We present
a comprehensive formulation of the Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based
anomaly detection framework and demonstrate how the active learning loop
progressively enhances the model's performance. The framework is evaluated on
real-world, imbalanced provenance trace data from the DARPA Transparent
Computing program, where APT-like attacks account for just 0.004\% of the data.
The datasets, which cover multiple operating systems including Android, Linux,
BSD, and Windows, are tested in two attack scenarios. The results show
substantial improvements in detection rates during active learning,
outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于本地差分隐私联邦学习的模型毒化攻击框架，能够避免多种防御机制并显著降低全局模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习与本地差分隐私结合虽能保护隐私，但容易受到恶意参与者的模型毒化攻击，当前协议在对抗MPA方面的稳健性研究不足。

Method: 提出了一种新颖且可扩展的模型毒化攻击框架，通过在遵循本地隐私约束的前提下最大化全局训练损失来实现。为对抗Multi-Krum和修剪均值等防御机制，设计了适配性攻击技术。

Result: 在三种代表性LDPFL协议、三个标准数据集和两类深度神经网络上评估，实验结果表明适配性攻击能显著降低全局模型性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了LDPFL协议的关键漏洞，强调了需要更加稳健的防御策略来应对模型毒化攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) combined with local differential privacy (LDP)
enables privacy-preserving model training across decentralized data sources.
However, the decentralized data-management paradigm leaves LDPFL vulnerable to
participants with malicious intent. The robustness of LDPFL protocols,
particularly against model poisoning attacks (MPA), where adversaries inject
malicious updates to disrupt global model convergence, remains insufficiently
studied. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensible model poisoning
attack framework tailored for LDPFL settings. Our approach is driven by the
objective of maximizing the global training loss while adhering to local
privacy constraints. To counter robust aggregation mechanisms such as
Multi-Krum and trimmed mean, we develop adaptive attacks that embed carefully
crafted constraints into a reverse training process, enabling evasion of these
defenses. We evaluate our framework across three representative LDPFL
protocols, three benchmark datasets, and two types of deep neural networks.
Additionally, we investigate the influence of data heterogeneity and privacy
budgets on attack effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our
adaptive attacks can significantly degrade the performance of the global model,
revealing critical vulnerabilities and highlighting the need for more robust
LDPFL defense strategies against MPA. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着人工智能体复杂度增加，设计能有效塑造其行为和环境变得至关重要。本文将此原则扩展到生物神经网络（神经类器官），旨在研究学习机制和搭建计算神经科学与AI的桥梁

Method: 设计了三个可扩展的闭环虚拟环境：条件回避任务、一维捕食者-猎物场景、经典Pong游戏复现；提出基于LLM的元学习方法自动生成优化实验协议；采用多模态方法在电生理、细胞和分子水平评估突触可塑性

Conclusion: 该框架为研究生物神经网络的学习机制提供了系统方法，通过虚拟环境和自动化协议设计，推动了生物智能体研究的发展，为理解智能的本质提供了新途径

Abstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments
that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a
critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle
to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural
organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual
environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the
underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task
environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2)
a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic
Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the
sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols
based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.
Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language
Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental
protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,
we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic
plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work
bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering
a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a
controlled biological substrate.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发适用于当前NISQ时代量子系统的实用图像压缩方法，解决传统像素级编码量子比特效率低的问题

Method: 将图像分割为固定大小的bixels块，计算每个块的总强度，构建全局直方图，将归一化平方根bin计数作为振幅编码到量子态中，使用PennyLane进行振幅嵌入并在IBM量子硬件上执行

Result: 仅需5-7个量子比特即可实现高质量图像重建，在量子比特效率方面显著优于传统像素级编码方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整直方图bin数量可以在保真度和资源使用之间进行权衡，验证了在当前NISQ量子系统上的实际应用价值

Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing
color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image
into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within
each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block
intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as
amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed
using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state
is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of
block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant
qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of
the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off
between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality
reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming
conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating
the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.

TL;DR: 量子联邦学习(QFL)存在对抗噪声脆弱性问题，RobQFL通过在联邦循环中嵌入对抗训练来提升鲁棒性，通过调节客户端覆盖率、扰动调度和优化策略，在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子联邦学习结合了隐私保护和量子计算优势，但其对抗噪声的鲁棒性尚未被研究。研究发现QFL与集中式量子学习同样脆弱，需要开发鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出RobQFL方法，在联邦学习循环中直接嵌入对抗训练，提供三个可调参数：客户端覆盖率γ(0-100%)、扰动调度策略(固定ε vs ε混合)、优化方式(微调 vs 从头训练)，并定义了准确率-鲁棒性面积和鲁棒性体积两个评估指标。

Result: 在15客户端模拟中，仅对20-50%客户端进行对抗训练即可在ε≤0.1时提升准确率约15个百分点，且干净准确率损失小于2个百分点；微调可额外提升3-5个百分点。覆盖率≥75%时，中等ε混合策略最优；标签排序的非IID数据分割使鲁棒性减半。

Conclusion: 数据异构性是量子联邦学习的主要风险因素，RobQFL通过灵活的对抗训练策略有效提升了量子联邦学习系统的对抗鲁棒性，为实际部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) merges privacy-preserving federation with
quantum computing gains, yet its resilience to adversarial noise is unknown. We
first show that QFL is as fragile as centralized quantum learning. We propose
Robust Quantum Federated Learning (RobQFL), embedding adversarial training
directly into the federated loop. RobQFL exposes tunable axes: client coverage
$\gamma$ (0-100\%), perturbation scheduling (fixed-$\varepsilon$ vs
$\varepsilon$-mixes), and optimization (fine-tune vs scratch), and distils the
resulting $\gamma \times \varepsilon$ surface into two metrics:
Accuracy-Robustness Area and Robustness Volume. On 15-client simulations with
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, IID and Non-IID conditions, training only 20-50\%
clients adversarially boosts $\varepsilon \leq 0.1$ accuracy $\sim$15 pp at $<
2$ pp clean-accuracy cost; fine-tuning adds 3-5 pp. With $\geq$75\% coverage, a
moderate $\varepsilon$-mix is optimal, while high-$\varepsilon$ schedules help
only at 100\% coverage. Label-sorted non-IID splits halve robustness,
underscoring data heterogeneity as a dominant risk.

Abstract: Efficient characterization of large-scale quantum systems, especially those
produced by quantum analog simulators and megaquop quantum computers, poses a
central challenge in quantum science due to the exponential scaling of the
Hilbert space with respect to system size. Recent advances in artificial
intelligence (AI), with its aptitude for high-dimensional pattern recognition
and function approximation, have emerged as a powerful tool to address this
challenge. A growing body of research has leveraged AI to represent and
characterize scalable quantum systems, spanning from theoretical foundations to
experimental realizations. Depending on how prior knowledge and learning
architectures are incorporated, the integration of AI into quantum system
characterization can be categorized into three synergistic paradigms: machine
learning, and, in particular, deep learning and language models. This review
discusses how each of these AI paradigms contributes to two core tasks in
quantum systems characterization: quantum property prediction and the
construction of surrogates for quantum states. These tasks underlie diverse
applications, from quantum certification and benchmarking to the enhancement of
quantum algorithms and the understanding of strongly correlated phases of
matter. Key challenges and open questions are also discussed, together with
future prospects at the interface of AI and quantum science.

using various feature maps and qubit configurations, evaluating their
suitability through Kernel-Target Alignment (KTA). The SVM dual problem is
reformulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem,

Method: 在空间扩展的El Farol酒吧问题中进行实验，观察LLM代理在60%阈值等提示约束下的自主决策行为

Result: LLM代理自发产生了去酒吧的动机，形成集体行为，行为更像人类而非完全解决问题，展现了外部制约与内部社会偏好的复杂交互

Conclusion: LLM代理能自然平衡游戏理论理性与社会动机，实现了传统游戏理论无法处理的新型集体决策模型

Abstract: We investigate the emergent social dynamics of Large Language Model (LLM)
agents in a spatially extended El Farol Bar problem, observing how they
autonomously navigate this classic social dilemma. As a result, the LLM agents
generated a spontaneous motivation to go to the bar and changed their decision
making by becoming a collective. We also observed that the LLM agents did not
solve the problem completely, but rather behaved more like humans. These
findings reveal a complex interplay between external incentives
(prompt-specified constraints such as the 60\% threshold) and internal
incentives (culturally-encoded social preferences derived from pre-training),
demonstrating that LLM agents naturally balance formal game-theoretic
rationality with social motivations that characterize human behavior. These
findings suggest that a new model of group decision making, which could not be
handled in the previous game-theoretic problem setting, can be realized by LLM
agents.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了6G网络中LLM代理运行的资源限制问题，为6G时代的到来推动了技术进步

Abstract: The ubiquitous computing resources in 6G networks provide ideal environments
for the fusion of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent services through
the agent framework. With auxiliary modules and planning cores, LLM-enabled
agents can autonomously plan and take actions to deal with diverse environment
semantics and user intentions. However, the limited resources of individual
network devices significantly hinder the efficient operation of LLM-enabled
agents with complex tool calls, highlighting the urgent need for efficient
multi-level device collaborations. To this end, the framework and method of the
LLM-enabled multi-agent system with dual-loop terminal-edge collaborations are
proposed in 6G networks. Firstly, the outer loop consists of the iterative
collaborations between the global agent and multiple sub-agents deployed on
edge servers and terminals, where the planning capability is enhanced through
task decomposition and parallel sub-task distribution. Secondly, the inner loop
utilizes sub-agents with dedicated roles to circularly reason, execute, and
replan the sub-task, and the parallel tool calling generation with offloading
strategies is incorporated to improve efficiency. The improved task planning
capability and task execution efficiency are validated through the conducted
case study in 6G-supported urban safety governance. Finally, the open
challenges and future directions are thoroughly analyzed in 6G networks,
accelerating the advent of the 6G era.

Abstract: This study presents the development of a domain-responsive edge-aware
multiscale Graph Neural Network for predicting steady, turbulent flow and
thermal behavior in a two-dimensional channel containing arbitrarily shaped
complex pin-fin geometries. The training dataset was constructed through an
automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and
flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized
using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through
Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure,
where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a
normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed
distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as
input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict
temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from
ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing
boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the
pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion,
the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for
simulations in complex flow configurations.

Abstract: Memristors are an emerging technology that enables artificial intelligence
(AI) accelerators with high energy efficiency and radiation robustness --
properties that are vital for the deployment of AI on-board spacecraft.
However, space applications require reliable and precise computations, while
memristive devices suffer from non-idealities, such as device variability,
conductance drifts, and device faults. Thus, porting neural networks (NNs) to
memristive devices often faces the challenge of severe performance degradation.
In this work, we show in simulations that memristor-based NNs achieve
competitive performance levels on on-board tasks, such as navigation \& control
and geodesy of asteroids. Through bit-slicing, temporal averaging of NN layers,
and periodic activation functions, we improve initial results from around
$0.07$ to $0.01$ and $0.3$ to $0.007$ for both tasks using RRAM devices, coming
close to state-of-the-art levels ($0.003-0.005$ and $0.003$, respectively). Our
results demonstrate the potential of memristors for on-board space
applications, and we are convinced that future technology and NN improvements
will further close the performance gap to fully unlock the benefits of
memristors.

TL;DR: 提出了GetNetUPAM分层嵌套交叉验证框架和ARPA-N神经网络架构，用于提升水下被动声学监测的模型稳定性和泛化能力，在生态多样性评估中取得了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下被动声学监测数据存在固有噪声和复杂信号依赖性问题，现有方法难以处理环境噪声变化、传播效应多样性和混合声源带来的挑战，需要更鲁棒的架构和严格评估方法

Method: 开发了GetNetUPAM分层嵌套交叉验证框架，按站点-年份划分数据以保持异质性；提出ARPA-N神经网络，采用自适应分辨率池化和空间注意力机制处理不规则频谱图维度

Result: ARPA-N在GetNetUPAM评估下相比DenseNet基线平均精度提升14.4%，所有指标的变异性降低了一个数量级（log2尺度），在不同站点-年份折叠中实现了一致检测

Conclusion: 该框架和架构显著提升了水下生物声学监测的准确性和可扩展性，能够有效应对生态多样性带来的挑战，为长期生态分析提供了可靠工具

Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal
data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal
dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing
has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient
noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic
sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce
GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to
quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are
partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording
heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental
subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year
blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while
standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across
UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.
Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution
Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular
spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the
receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under
GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet
baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all
metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing
scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

Motivation: 现有机器学习作曲软件模型结构复杂，难以分析如何理解作曲家音乐特征，需要简单模型来研究内部状态

Method: 采用受限玻尔兹曼机(RBM)训练巴赫音乐数据，利用RBM的简单结构分析学习后的内部状态

Result: 学习后的RBM能够成功创作音乐

Conclusion: RBM作为一种简单模型，不仅能模仿巴赫音乐风格进行创作，还能提供对作曲家音乐特征的可解释性分析

Abstract: Recently, software has been developed that uses machine learning to mimic the
style of a particular composer, such as J. S. Bach. However, since such
software often adopts machine learning models with complex structures, it is
difficult to analyze how the software understands the characteristics of the
composer's music. In this study, we adopted J. S. Bach's music for training of
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Since the structure of RBMs is simple, it
allows us to investigate the internal states after learning. We found that the
learned RBM is able to compose music.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their
reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely
unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic
music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to
interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries.
Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and
accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing
the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic
evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and
fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music
reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and
scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical
benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns
in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and
persistent challenges for MLLMs in symbolic music reasoning and analysis. We
release the dataset and code.

Motivation: 音乐对抗攻击在音乐信息检索领域受到关注，当前MIR系统存在安全漏洞，需要开发更有效的攻击方法来揭示这些脆弱性并推动更鲁棒模型的发展。

Method: 首先进行重要性分析识别关键音频段，然后利用生成式修复模型在这些段上生成对抗扰动，通过目标模型的输出指导修复过程，确保扰动既有效又难以察觉。

Result: 在多个MIR任务上评估显示，MAIA在白盒和黑盒设置下都实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持最小感知失真，主观听力测试证实了对抗样本的高音频保真度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MIR系统的脆弱性，强调了开发更鲁棒和安全模型的必要性，MAIA框架为评估和改进MIR系统的安全性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Music adversarial attacks have garnered significant interest in the field of
Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we present Music Adversarial
Inpainting Attack (MAIA), a novel adversarial attack framework that supports
both white-box and black-box attack scenarios. MAIA begins with an importance
analysis to identify critical audio segments, which are then targeted for
modification. Utilizing generative inpainting models, these segments are
reconstructed with guidance from the output of the attacked model, ensuring
subtle and effective adversarial perturbations. We evaluate MAIA on multiple
MIR tasks, demonstrating high attack success rates in both white-box and
black-box settings while maintaining minimal perceptual distortion.
Additionally, subjective listening tests confirm the high audio fidelity of the
adversarial samples. Our findings highlight vulnerabilities in current MIR
systems and emphasize the need for more robust and secure models.

Result: 评估显示了编辑描述的各个部分（动作、类别、时间）都很重要

Conclusion: 证明了"重新组合"是一个重要且实用的应用场景

Abstract: Editing complex real-world sound scenes is difficult because individual sound
sources overlap in time. Generative models can fill-in missing or corrupted
details based on their strong prior understanding of the data domain. We
present a system for editing individual sound events within complex scenes able
to delete, insert, and enhance individual sound events based on textual edit
descriptions (e.g., ``enhance Door'') and a graphical representation of the
event timing derived from an ``event roll'' transcription. We present an
encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on
synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated
sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Evaluation reveals the
importance of each part of the edit descriptions -- action, class, timing. Our
work demonstrates ``recomposition'' is an important and practical application.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够生成引人入胜的故事，但将叙事文本连接到可玩的视觉环境仍然是程序化内容生成中的一个开放挑战。

Method: 系统识别三个关键时间帧，提取"对象-关系-对象"三元组形式的空间谓词，使用GameTileNet数据集的affordance-aware语义嵌入检索视觉资源，使用细胞自动机生成分层地形，并基于谓词结构的空间规则放置对象。

Result: 在十个不同故事中评估了系统，分析了瓦片对象匹配、affordance层对齐和跨帧空间约束满足情况。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story
generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments
remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a
lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of
2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given
an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames,
extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples,
and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the
GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata,
and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure.
We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching,
affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.
This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation
and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic
tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在保持视图一致性的同时实现高质量粉刷，并支持可选的区域控制风格转移

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which
leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated
promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality
stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style
consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic
correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we
introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while
maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style
transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D
representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.
Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized
multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned
depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared
attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,
which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,
inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth
maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among
stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced
Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image
regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that
this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables
the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.
Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that
our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

Abstract: We report on our tool, Pulse Infinite, that uses proof techniques to show
non-termination (divergence) in large programs. Pulse Infinite works
compositionally and under-approximately: the former supports scale, and the
latter ensures soundness for proving divergence. Prior work focused on small
benchmarks in the tens or hundreds of lines of code (LoC), and scale limits
their practicality: a single company may have tens of millions, or even
hundreds of millions of LoC or more. We report on applying Pulse Infinite to
over a hundred million lines of open-source and proprietary software written in
C, C++, and Hack, identifying over 30 previously unknown issues, establishing a

Conclusion: 该方法为关系超事件的动态驱动因素提供了更深入的洞察，能够识别传统线性模型无法捕捉的复杂模式。

Abstract: Recent technological advances have made it easier to collect large and
complex networks of time-stamped relational events connecting two or more
entities. Relational hyper-event models (RHEMs) aim to explain the dynamics of
these events by modeling the event rate as a function of statistics based on
past history and external information.
  However, despite the complexity of the data, most current RHEM approaches
still rely on a linearity assumption to model this relationship. In this work,
we address this limitation by introducing a more flexible model that allows the
effects of statistics to vary non-linearly and over time. While time-varying
and non-linear effects have been used in relational event modeling, we take
this further by modeling joint time-varying and non-linear effects using tensor
product smooths.
  We validate our methodology on both synthetic and empirical data. In
particular, we use RHEMs to study how patterns of scientific collaboration and
impact evolve over time. Our approach provides deeper insights into the dynamic
factors driving relational hyper-events, allowing us to evaluate potential
non-monotonic patterns that cannot be identified using linear models.

Conclusion: 提出的GCFs参数化方法具有通用逼近性质，为处理广义凸函数相关的优化问题提供了有效的数值工具，特别是在将复杂双层优化转化为单层优化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Solutions to a wide range of optimization problems, from optimal transport
theory to mathematical economics, often take the form of generalized convex
functions (GCFs). This characterization can be used to convert nested bilevel
optimization problems into single-level optimization problems. Despite this,
the characterization has not been fully exploited in numerical optimization.
  When the solution to an optimization problem is known to belong to a
particular class of objects, this information can be leveraged by
parameterizing that class of objects and optimizing over this parameterization.
The hallmark of a good parameterization is the Universal Approximation Property
(UAP): that is, the parameterization approximates any object in the class
arbitrarily well. For example, neural networks satisfy the UAP with respect to
the class of continuous functions.
  Building on the literature concerned with the parameterization of convex
functions, we extend these ideas to GCFs. We present a convex and potentially
one-to-one parameterization of GCFs and their gradients that satisfies the UAP.
We also compare this class to shallow neural networks and highlight their
shared characteristics.
  The ideas pursued here have been implemented in the Python package
\href{https://github.com/MoeenNehzati/gconvex}{\texttt{gconvex}}, available
online. Using it, we tackle the problem of finding the revenue-maximizing
auction for multiple goods and demonstrate how our parameterization can
effectively solve this problem.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了凸二次规划中数据驱动投影学习的泛化分析挑战，为高维优化问题的可扩展性提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization
instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems.
Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs
(LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances
drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the
generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for
convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex
QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this
complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this
challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized
within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing
Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled
active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a
Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing
learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings,
including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where
we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.
