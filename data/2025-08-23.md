### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出统一协同训练框架，通过单一SFT阶段集成多种安全行为（积极、消极、拒绝），使用系统指令或魔法令牌动态激活不同行为，实现推理时的灵活切换和安全控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM内容安全方法（如SFT和RLHF）依赖多阶段训练流程，缺乏细粒度和部署后可控性，需要更高效灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用协同训练框架，在单一SFT阶段同时训练三种安全行为模式，通过系统级指令或魔法令牌动态激活不同行为，实现推理时的行为切换。

Result: 方法安全对齐质量与SFT+DPO相当，8B模型在安全性能上显著超越DeepSeek-R1（671B），同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案，通过安全对齐边际实现了前所未有的细粒度控制能力。

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WMT25机器翻译共享任务的初步自动评估排名报告，提醒参与者注意自动排名的局限性，最终排名将以人工评估为准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向任务参与者分享基于自动指标的初步评估结果，帮助他们在准备系统提交论文时参考，同时强调自动评估可能存在的偏差

Method: 使用自动评估指标对机器翻译系统进行初步排名，特别指出重新排序技术（如质量估计重排序和最小贝叶斯风险解码）可能带来的偏差

Result: 提供了基于自动指标的初步排名结果，但明确指出这不是最终结果，自动排名可能偏向采用特定技术的系统

Conclusion: 自动评估排名仅供参考，WMT25的官方最终排名将基于更可靠的人工评估，人工评估结果将取代自动排名

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于LLM的文化本土化框架，自动生成包含本土实体的多语言数学应用题数据集，解决低资源语言中的文化偏向问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言数学评测集主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心的实体，导致低资源语言的文化本土化数据缺乏，影响了真实的多语言数学理解能力。

Method: 设计了一种LLM驱动的文化本土化框架，能够自动从现有数据源生成包含本土名字、组织和货币等实体的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架能够有效减少英语中心实体偏向，并在多种语言中提升模型在本土实体环境下的稳健性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了文化本土化对于真实多语言数学理解能力的重要性，提出的框架为解决低资源语言的文化偏向问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，通过少量程序化筛选的语料对语言模型进行精细调整，在斯洛文翻译任务上实现了显著的性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过较少的易产生数据资源来改进通用指令调整的大型语言模型的机器翻译性能

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)技术，通过程序化筛选公开数据集的子集来训练GaMS-9B-Instruct模型。使用两个LLM模型翻译英语维基百科文章，然后基于合成评估指标和COMET等自动评估指标对翻译进行质量排名

Result: 精细调整后的模型在翻译维基百科文章时，相比于基线模型分别获得了约0.04和0.02的COMET分数提升，同时更一致地避免了语言和格式错误

Conclusion: 通过DPO技术和程序化筛选的质量排名数据，可以用较少的数据资源有效提升通用语言模型的翻译性能，尤其在小语种翻译任务上表现突出

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass自定义输入数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话式可解释AI系统在英语意图识别方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的问题。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL涵盖5种语言；提出新的解析方法；创建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取；使用多种LLM和BERT模型进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的不同解析策略；在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有助于提升多语言ConvXAI系统的意图识别和自定义输入处理能力，解决了数据稀缺和语言多样性挑战。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样（SSS）算法，通过将小规模草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，而保持目标模型不变，在降低推理成本的同时实现测试时对齐效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM的安全性和推理能力，但往往带来显著的推理成本增加，限制了实际应用。受推测采样加速技术的启发，希望解决测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题

Method: SSS算法：让草稿模型与人类偏好对齐，目标模型保持不变；通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布来利用对齐草稿模型与未对齐目标模型之间的分布偏移，从而恢复RLHF最优解

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，以显著降低的推理成本获得了优越的金牌奖励分数，验证了算法的有效性和效率

Conclusion: SSS算法成功解决了测试时对齐的高成本问题，通过巧妙的分布偏移利用实现了高效的对齐效果，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、多级过滤和结构化对齐验证来提升长文本生成的完整性评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，LLM评估方法存在幻觉和对齐问题

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配 3)结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长形式QA基准测试中，相比强基线方法在召回准确率上有显著提升，得到人工标注和LLM评估的双重验证

Conclusion: LongRecall提供了一个系统化的召回评估基础构件，能有效减少假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表达和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 结合LLMs与组合推理方法，通过符号推理提升结构化预测任务的准确性和一致性，证明结构化学习在LLM时代仍有价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在语言任务中表现出色但存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中需要保持结构一致性

Method: 将LLMs与组合推理结合，通过提示策略估计LLM置信度值，并采用符号推理和结构化预测目标进行校准和微调

Result: 无论采用何种提示策略，符号推理的加入都能带来更一致和准确的预测，结构化学习显著提升挑战性任务的性能

Conclusion: 符号推理能有效弥补LLMs的结构一致性不足，结构化学习在LLM时代仍然具有重要意义和价值

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

### [9] [Nemotron-CC-Math: A 133 Billion-Token-Scale High Quality Math Pretraining Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15096)
*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nemotron-CC-Math，一个从Common Crawl构建的大规模高质量数学语料库，通过新颖的领域无关管道实现鲁棒的科学文本提取，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集因脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保留数学结构而导致质量下降，需要更高质量的数学预训练数据。

Method: 使用布局感知渲染(lynx)和基于LLM的针对性清理阶段，恢复各种格式的数学内容(MathJax、KaTeX、MathML)，保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件、标准化为LaTeX表示并纠正不一致性。

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+(133B tokens)和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+(52B tokens)语料库，后者比之前最高质量的FineMath-4+多5.5倍token。预训练Nemotron-T 8B模型在MATH上提升+4.8到+12.6，在MBPP+上提升+4.6到+14.3，同时改善MMLU和MMLU-Stem的通用领域性能。

Conclusion: 这是第一个从噪声网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和通用推理方面带来可衡量的提升，为开源数学预训练语料库设立了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

### [10] [Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139)
*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，通过外部证据减少LLM幻觉，实验表明检索证据和验证原子假设能显著提升性能并提供可解释答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们经常提出包含错误假设的问题，这类问题没有常规答案。大语言模型(LLM)由于幻觉问题经常产生误导性回答，需要先识别错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，提出利用外部证据来缓解幻觉的方法，通过生成和验证原子假设来识别错误假设。

Result: 在五个LLM上的实验表明：(1)整合检索证据是有益的；(2)生成和验证原子假设能带来更多改进，并通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 利用外部证据和原子假设验证的方法能有效识别和回答包含错误假设的问题，减少LLM的幻觉现象，提高回答的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环增强现有LVLM模型，在复杂多轮多模态对话任务上显著超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro等商业模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和大视觉语言模型在处理需要深度推理、持续上下文理解、实体跟踪和多步指令跟随的复杂多轮视觉基础任务时仍面临重大挑战，现有基准无法捕捉真实世界多模态交互的动态性和复杂性。

Method: 提出MMDR-Bench数据集（300个复杂多轮对话场景）和CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代的"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环机制，无需重新训练底层模型即可增强现有LVLM的推理和指令跟随能力。

Result: 在MMDR-Bench上CoLVLM Agent平均人类评估得分4.03，显著超越GPT-4o（3.92）和Gemini 1.5 Pro（3.85），在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异，且在长对话轮次中保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: CoLVLM Agent的模块化设计和迭代方法有效解决了复杂多模态交互中的挑战，验证了该框架在提升多模态对话推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一个语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少token冗余，在保持模型性能的同时实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足，特别是在长上下文场景中

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类以合并语义等价的token；然后基于语义密度分配异构token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵span中使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的流程奖励模型主要针对通用或STEM领域，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理需要更结构化、符号化且对事实和监管准确性敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM，一个领域专业化的轨迹感知PRM，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA等金融推理基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于通用PRMs和强领域基线，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化的奖励建模对于使大语言模型与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域的中间推理监督提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our

### [14] [SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15212)
*Huanxuan Liao,Yixing Xu,Shizhu He,Guanchen Li,Xuanwu Yin,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，通过在通道级别应用非结构化稀疏性来减少内存使用，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，导致效率和模型准确性之间的平衡受限。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV进行剪枝，并在注意力分数计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目，与现有KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长序列，对等长序列减少KV缓存存储30%以上，即使在80%的激进剪枝比例下性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级别的稀疏性处理有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了长上下文推理的效率。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个成本效益高的框架，通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用QA中表现良好，但在领域特定场景中表现不佳。检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，而持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨领域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识。引入结构化推理数据生成流程，并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并以显著更低的成本匹配领域预训练的大型语言模型。

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识获取策略，有效解决了领域特定知识获取的挑战，提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案，能够充分利用内部知识并增强推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER是一个自引导的方法，通过从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度、逐步检索，来解决LLM在多步骤工具使用中的工具选择、参数生成和工具链规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖手动设计任务特定演示或从策划库中检索，需要大量专家努力，随着工具多样性和任务难度增加，提示工程变得复杂低效。

Method: 提出Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式地扩充经验池，包含过去成功的轨迹。

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%。在τ-bench真实世界领域测试中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: SEER方法能够有效解决LLM在多步骤工具使用中的挑战，通过自引导的经验检索机制实现持续性能改进，无需依赖静态或手动策划的库。

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中如何有效使用检查表，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动生成检查表是一种有前景但尚未充分探索的方法。

Method: 使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种不同规模的模型上进行实验，通过成对比较和直接评分任务评估检查表效果，并分析检查表项与人工评估的相关性。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中倾向于提高评估性能，但在直接评分中益处不太一致。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项也常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在潜在不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准，以指导人工和自动评估，确保评估的一致性和有效性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，显著减少小语言模型词汇相关组件的内存占用达99%，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在资源受限环境中部署时，词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）占用大量内存，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和计算特性不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：卸载嵌入组件，为LM头实现混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，按需加载词汇组件。

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，任务性能仅有最小程度下降或无下降，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法。

Conclusion: VocabTailor有效解决了小语言模型在边缘设备部署中的内存瓶颈问题，通过动态词汇选择实现了内存效率与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，一个人工编写的泰语指令数据集，用于评估和调整大语言模型在泰语中的表现，解决了翻译数据缺乏文化和领域特定细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在英语中指令跟随表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中的表现很少有研究。现有的测试集多依赖翻译，缺乏文化和领域特定的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，覆盖四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员的多阶段质量控制过程。进行两个研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的性能差距；(2)指令调整研究与消融实验，隔离本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct调整的模型在领域内外测试中都显著超过使用翻译数据的模型，证明本土化指令数据的优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业背景的本土化指令数据，以提高大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: 提出了UniCoM管道和SWORDS算法，用于生成高质量、自然的代码切换语音样本，并构建了CS-FLEURS多语言代码切换语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实对话中代码切换现象普遍，但缺乏合适的训练数据集，限制了多语言语音技术的发展。

Method: 使用SWORDS算法（同义词替换单词），在保持句子语义的前提下，通过替换选定单词为翻译来生成代码切换语音，同时考虑词性。

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在客观和主观指标上都表现出高可懂度和自然度，与现有数据集性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动代码切换语音技术的发展，实现更具包容性的多语言系统。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的心理特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化和极化，抽象道德推理强但情感复杂情境处理差，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型职业模拟缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要评估教师角色的道德规范和心理特征。

Method: 构建EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并创建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理方面表现优异，但在情感复杂情境中表现较差；推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 提出了首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理安全评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

TL;DR: CARE是一种解决RAG中上下文-记忆冲突的新方法，通过上下文评估器和软提示技术来识别不可靠的外部上下文，提高LLM在知识冲突情况下的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在面对检索到的外部上下文与LLM参数知识冲突时，往往无法正确处理这种冲突，导致模型输出错误信息

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆token嵌入和对抗性软提示训练，识别不可靠上下文并引导推理

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均性能提升5.0%，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的方向，能够更好地处理知识冲突场景

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中事件的时间上下文往往没有明确表述，即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此需要自动挖掘时间常识来构建更鲁棒的语言模型。

Method: 提出了一个时间常识提取管道，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到超过80%的精确度，使用该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于基于现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量数据集，提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE是一个轻量级语音模型，仅需120毫秒（约一个音素长度）就能捕获关键音素特征，通过独立处理短固定窗口实现跨语言竞争性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯净音素表示，但通用音素识别通常需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式

Method: 处理短固定宽度窗口独立分析，学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式，通过监督和自监督训练在多种语言上进行评估

Result: 尽管参数少于当前方法，但在跨语言性能上表现竞争力，在UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试中展示了强大的跨语言泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过建模音素长度窗口内的基本声学模式，可以实现有效的通用语音处理

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全模型评估存在挑战：不同数据集和指标（如MRR、Hit@k）的评估结果不一致，难以进行整体性能比较和模型选择。

Method: 提出基于平均解距离的评估方法（EDAS），通过计算模型性能与平均解的相对距离，将多数据集、多指标的表现整合为[0,1]范围内的标准化分数。

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等基准数据集上的实验表明，EDAS能够有效整合多指标、多数据集的性能，提供一致、稳健和可推广的评估框架。

Conclusion: EDAS提供了一个统一的元度量标准，支持更明智的模型选择，促进跨数据集评估的公平性，解决了知识图谱补全模型评估中的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X是一个全面的多模态大语言模型可信度评估基准，包含5个可信度维度、2种新型风险类型和多种缓解策略，通过32个任务和28个数据集评估了30多个模型，揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞，并提出了推理增强的安全对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的可信度问题日益突出，现有评估方法往往关注狭窄方面且忽视了多模态引入的风险，需要构建全面的评估基准来系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、2种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）以及多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练和推理算法）。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有MLLM模型。

Result: 实验发现当前模型存在显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在关键局限性，虽然某些方法在特定方面有所改进，但很少有方法能有效解决整体可信度问题，且许多方法会引入意外的权衡而损害模型效用。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果。研究结果为未来改进提供了实用见解，特别是推理在平衡安全性和性能方面的益处。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的置信度调制推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测生成token数量来提升解码效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态推测长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了性能

Method: 利用drafter输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调制验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法为大型语言模型在不同不确定性条件下提供了高效、鲁棒的即插即用解码方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大词汇表通过降低token化文本的复杂度来提升语言模型性能，主要受益于高频词的预测不确定性降低，而非改善罕见词处理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大词汇表对语言模型性能提升的真正原因，现有实践倾向于使用更大词汇表但收益来源不明确

Method: 控制实验：在固定数据、计算和优化条件下，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K，分析token化文本复杂度、词级损失分解和频率不平衡效应

Result: 词汇表超过24K后主要加深token频率不平衡，但通过降低高频词的不确定性减少交叉熵；约束嵌入范数会逆转收益；相同收益可通过扩大模型参数获得

Conclusion: 大词汇表的收益源于降低token化文本复杂度，为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了原则性指导，阐明了预训练中的损失动态

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在处理多模态输入方面表现出色，但其在音频和文本信息冲突时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估其信息优先级选择机制。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准测试，通过不一致的音频-文本对评估模型表现，分析影响因素，探索监督微调缓解策略，并研究模型置信度模式。

Result: 发现LALMs存在严重的文本偏向性，在模态冲突时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能显著下降，即使面对矛盾输入也表现出持续过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在训练过程中需要改进模态平衡和开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准和模型，LLaSO为语音语言模型研究建立了基础性开放标准，有助于统一研究努力并加速社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language

overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和执行反馈机制显著提升了对话状态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床可解释、细粒度且高效的放射学报告评估解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 个性化营销对提升客户参与度和业务增长至关重要，现有研究主要集中在推荐系统和个性化广告，而个性化报价生成具有显著提升转化率和客户满意度的潜力

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调预训练的T5-Small编码器-解码器语言模型，采用InfoNCE损失在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关报价，引入自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间

Result: 在模拟客户行为和报价接受模式的合成数据集上评估，相比监督微调基线，报价接受率提高了17%

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面具有显著效果，SLM4Offer模型展示了在个性化报价生成任务中的优越性能

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Motivation: 质疑大型语言模型是否能够有效地处理用户主观性的浏览行为，这种行为形成了每个用户独特的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM方法，采用聚类训练的方式，使用页面级别的tokenizer训练小型模型，为不同聚类的用户群体训练异质的参数集。

Conclusion: 聚类训练的异质性模型能够更好地对准用户主观行为，提高了模型的对齐效果。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，主要是因为人类定义的难度标准与模型实际训练过程中感知的难度不匹配。

Method: 提出使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量标准，根据单个训练样本对模型输出的影响程度来排序训练数据，从影响力小的样本开始训练。

Result: 使用基于训练数据影响力的课程学习方法，在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的性能高出超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但需要采用更符合模型训练动态的模型中心化难度度量标准。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

TL;DR: SLM-Bench是首个专门评估小型语言模型的多维度基准测试，涵盖准确性、计算效率和可持续性指标，在15个SLM、9个NLP任务、23个数据集上进行了全面评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型虽然具有计算效率和可访问性优势，但缺乏对其性能和环境影响系统性评估的标准基准测试。

Method: 开发了SLM-Bench基准测试，在4种硬件配置下评估15个SLM模型，使用23个数据集覆盖9个NLP任务和14个领域，量化11个正确性、计算和能耗指标。

Result: 评估结果显示了SLM模型之间的多样化权衡关系，一些模型在准确性方面表现优异，而另一些模型在能源效率方面更胜一筹。

Conclusion: SLM-Bench为SLM评估设立了新标准，填补了资源效率与实际应用之间的差距，提供了开源基准测试管道以确保可重现性。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HebID是首个希伯来语多标签社会身份检测语料库，包含5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子，标注12种细粒度社会身份，在希伯来语调优的大语言模型上取得最佳效果（F1=0.74），并用于分析精英话语与公众身份认同的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有身份检测数据集主要针对英语、单标签且类别粗糙，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中 nuanced 社会身份的研究。

Method: 构建5536个以色列政客Facebook帖子数据集（2018-2021），手动标注12种基于调查数据的细粒度社会身份，比较多标签/单标签编码器和2B-9B参数生成式LLM的性能。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM取得最佳效果（macro-F1=0.74），分析显示政客身份表达存在流行度、时间趋势、聚类模式和性别相关差异，精英话语与公众身份优先级存在差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，揭示了政治语言与社会身份的深层联系。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

TL;DR: Dream 7B是当前最强大的开源扩散大语言模型，采用离散扩散建模并行优化序列，在通用、数学和编程任务上超越现有扩散语言模型，具有卓越的规划能力和推理灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的自回归模型只能顺序生成token，限制了生成效率和灵活性。研究团队希望开发一种能够并行生成、支持任意顺序生成和填充能力的扩散语言模型。

Method: 采用离散扩散建模方法，通过迭代去噪并行优化序列。使用自回归LLM初始化和上下文自适应的token级噪声重调度等简单有效的训练技术。

Result: 在通用任务、数学任务和编程任务上一致超越现有扩散语言模型，展现出优越的规划能力和推理灵活性，包括任意顺序生成、填充能力以及可调节的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: Dream 7B通过创新的离散扩散建模方法，成功实现了并行序列生成，为扩散式语言建模提供了新的研究方向，并发布了Dream-Base和Dream-Instruct两个版本以促进后续研究。

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政治人物使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)的自动分析可行性，通过大规模计算研究理解民主话语中的规范性攻击现象。

Method: 构建包含10,410个句子的希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例；开发两阶段分类管道，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM。

Result: 最佳模型(DictaLM 2.0)在二元PDD检测中F1得分0.74，特征分类macro-F1得分0.67；发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更普遍，右翼政治人物使用更多。

Conclusion: 自动化PDD分析对于理解民主话语具有可行性和重要价值，能够揭示政治话语中的去合法化模式和时间趋势。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Conclusion: SafetyFlow提供了首个完全自动化的基准构建流程和全面的安全基准，显著提升了LLM安全评估的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于作为生成器防御有害内容的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究如何对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO框架，通过强化学习利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准测试中有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 通过对齐LLM的判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本就能进一步增强模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

Motivation: 科学综述文章对总结研究进展至关重要，但由于学术文献快速增长，人工撰写变得不可行。虽然大语言模型有自动化潜力，但缺乏标准化基准阻碍了进展

Method: 构建SurGE基准，包括：(1)测试实例集（主题描述、专家撰写综述、完整参考文献）(2)百万级学术文献检索库。提出自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖度、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度评估

Result: 对多种基于LLM的方法评估表明，综述生成任务极具挑战性，即使是先进的自反思框架也难以胜任

Conclusion: 该任务复杂度高，需要持续研究。作者已开源所有代码、数据和模型

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）表现为不同上下文位置的非均匀敏感性，严重损害长上下文理解和处理能力。现有方法通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的PB仍然存在。

Method: 提出了Pos2Distill框架，利用位置诱导的差异来抵消PB本身。针对检索和推理两种范式设计了专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升，所有上下文位置都获得改善。

Conclusion: 两个专门化系统表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，同时在各自任务上实现了优越性能，有效解决了长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

Motivation: 布加拉语作为世界第七大语言但数字化表现不足，需要通过词干提取技术降低语言分析的复杂度，特别是对于这种资源稀缺且语法变化丰富的语言。

Method: 进行了布加拉语词干提取方法的综述性调研，分析了现有研究的间断性和可复现实现的穷乏情况，并批判了相关的评估方法。

Result: 识别出了布加拉语词干提取领域的重大空白，并在考虑该语言丰富语法和多样方言的背景下，提出了相关挑战。

Conclusion: 建议发展健壮的布加拉语词干提取器，并建议在该领域继续深入研究以提升语言分析和处理能力。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

Motivation: 电商平台包含丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能。

Method: 构建EcomMMMU数据集（40万+样本，890万+图像），包含8个核心任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性地使用多图像进行下游任务。

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低效果，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容方面存在困难；SUMEI方法在实验中显示出有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 电商多模态理解中需要更智能的图像选择策略，SUMEI方法通过数据驱动的视觉效用预测，能够更有效地利用多图像信息，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算方面仍有不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其对LLM推理能力的泛化效果和改进机制尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖9个不同推理类别，用于评估TIR在各领域的有效性。同时提出了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估表明，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中都持续优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在推进LLM复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

### [55] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了人脸关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在多个基准测试中实现了SOTA性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在人脸关键点检测中广泛使用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这是否是唯一有效的方法，希望探索替代方案。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标，替代传统的Soft-argmax方法，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个人脸关键点基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍，同时保持更好或相当的准确率。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非实现高性能人脸关键点检测的唯一途径，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，具有更快的收敛速度和竞争性的精度。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种将图卷积网络(GCN)与Voronoi图相结合的新方法，通过将图像表示为图结构并利用Delaunay三角剖分进行优化，显著提升了图像分类的预处理效率和分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，需要一种能够更好建模关系数据的方法来提升图像分类性能，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分对图进行优化，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类精度改进，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了最先进的方法，交叉验证结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为图像分类提供了新的视角，还拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的潜在应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种更简单的、仅使用RGB的替代方案，直接在类别级别学习，统一物体检测和9自由度姿态估计，无需额外数据

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，端到端训练

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越之前RGB方法，接近RGB-D系统性能

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法在类别级9自由度姿态估计上的有效性，简化了流程并取得了优异性能

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的物理-数字攻击检测框架，通过配对采样对比学习来识别真实和伪造的人脸图像，在基准测试中达到2.10%的错误率，模型轻量且训练快速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人脸反欺诈系统使用独立的模型处理物理攻击和数字伪造，增加了系统复杂性和延迟，且无法应对组合攻击。需要统一的解决方案来同时检测两种攻击类型。

Method: 提出了配对采样对比框架，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍图像对，学习模态无关的活体检测特征。通过对比学习来区分真实和伪造样本。

Result: 在第六届人脸反欺诈挑战赛的统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，实现了2.10%的平均分类错误率（ACER），优于现有方法。模型计算量仅为4.46 GFLOPs，训练时间不到1小时。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个高效、轻量级的统一解决方案，能够同时检测物理呈现攻击和数字伪造，具有实际部署的可行性，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，通过3-20步采样从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，比现有方法快10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百步采样步骤

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，TAIGen对ResNet成功率为70.6%，对MNASNet为80.8%，对ShuffleNet为97.8%；PSNR超过30dB，生成速度快10倍

Conclusion: TAIGen在保持视觉质量的同时实现了高效的对抗攻击，是最具影响力的攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式精炼解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并引入定向伯努利扩散模型来精炼不确定区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在不足。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络。包含三个模块：CORE模块在掩码域应用可逆建模识别核心对象区域；CARE模块在RGB域扩展可逆原则实现前景-背景分离；FINE模块使用定向伯努利扩散模型精炼不确定区域。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，且计算成本较低。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式精炼的独特协同，为构建鲁棒的CVP系统提供了新范式，并扩展为双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型使用线性轨迹，可能迫使生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域，影响语义对齐和指令遵循能力

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变，学习平滑的非线性轨迹

Result: 在MS COCO数据集上达到SOTA性能，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模能显著增强模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真场景下都表现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）使用高阶排序损失监督质量预测；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量级变体HiRQA-S单图推理时间仅3.5ms，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和对齐学习，实现了优异的图像质量评估性能，解决了传统方法依赖主观标签和数据集偏差的问题，具有良好的泛化能力和实时部署可行性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Conclusion: 所提出的投资组合理论方法能有效应对边缘环境中时空相关的中断问题，为关键应用提供可靠的3D重建服务。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM通过提供稳健且可解释的洞察，成功弥合了自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距，展示了在医疗AI可解释性方面的重要进展。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理化问题，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景生成解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

Conclusion: DyMorph-B2I为肾脏病理学提供了有效的二元到实例分割解决方案，公开可用的管道有助于推动该领域的精确形态学分析。

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Method: 提出STAGNet模型，结合更好的空间-时间特征提取技术，并通过递归网络进行特征聚合，以改善现有图神经网络在交通事故预测中的性能

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，STAGNet模型在平均精度和平均碰撞时间值方面都超过了之前的方法，无论是在同一数据集跨校验还是在不同数据集进行训练和测试

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过提取更有效的空间-时间特征并通过递归网络进行聚合，可以显著提高仅使用行车记录仪视频输入的交通事故预测系统的性能

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过整合RGB、RGBD和点云等多模态数据，利用协作多模态编码和triplane潜在扩散模型，实现了高质量的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 使用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于triplane潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM仅使用少量训练数据就能达到与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了多模态数据集整合的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在3D生成领域取得了显著进展，证明了多模态方法在提升3D资产纹理和几何细节质量方面的优势。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向中心的原型对比聚类框架，通过软原型对比模块和双重一致性学习模块解决类别冲突和原型漂移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类别冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差

Method: 使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型，结合双重一致性学习模块对齐不同变换和邻域关系

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明该方法相比现有SOTA方法更有效

Conclusion: 该方法通过软原型计算和双重一致性学习有效解决了类别冲突和原型漂移问题，提升了聚类性能

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度协作框架能够有效结合高空广视野优势和低空精确导航能力，通过最小化信息交换实现高效协作，为复杂外部环境无人机导航提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中表现优异，但其序列化生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，与传统逐步细化方法形成对比。该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标，证明马尔可夫方式的加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样机制为扩散模型提供了一种高效的马尔可夫式加速采样方法，可与DDIM等技术结合进一步提升生成效果，证明了原始扩散过程本身具备高效采样潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and
provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two

Motivation: 现有车道拓扑推理方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配的监督策略导致监督范围有限，拓扑推理性能不佳。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器：交换交叉注意力和自注意力层顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块，增强车道检测多样性；实现一对多分配策略。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的大量实验表明，RATopo策略具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent

<details>

Motivation: 超声视频中先天性心脏病检测面临图像噪声和探头位置变异性的挑战，现有机器学习方法往往忽略时间信息、局限于二分类且缺乏预测校准。

Method: 提出时间提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习，通过图像编码器提取帧特征，可训练时间提取器聚合特征捕获心脏运动，并通过边缘铰链对比损失将视频表示与类别特定文本提示对齐。引入条件变分自编码器风格调制(CVAESM)模块学习潜在风格向量来调节嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Conclusion: TPA框架成功整合了时间建模、对比学习和不确定性量化，在超声视频CHD分类中表现出卓越性能和改进的校准特性，具有临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效COD解决方案，具有实际应用价值，计算需求低且性能竞争力强。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的即插即用框架，通过选择性提示嵌入调整和抗干扰噪声引导技术，有效防止文本到视频扩散模型生成有害或不当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全担忧，这些模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，需要一种有效的方法来防止不当内容的生成。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块无缝集成到现有T2V扩散模型中。

Result: 在四个任务（物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和露骨内容擦除）上均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成，在效果、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VideoEraser提供了一个有效的训练免费解决方案，能够显著抑制T2V扩散模型中不良内容的生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

TL;DR: 本文通过注意力敲除技术系统分析Video-LLMs内部机制，发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成，呈现两阶段处理模式，且时空建模更依赖语言引导检索而非视频token自注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，需要系统性的实证研究来揭示模型如何处理和理解视频内容。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计三种敲除变体（时间、空间、语言到视频），通过控制敲除层窗口实现全局和细粒度两种设置来分析模型行为。

Result: 发现：1）早期层主要负责视频信息提取；2）某些中间层对视频问答有异常重要影响；3）时空建模更依赖语言引导检索。这些见解可用于减少注意力计算。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作，为未来研究提供了可解释性和效率提升的视角。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

TL;DR: BioTune是一种进化自适应微调技术，通过进化算法选择性地微调层来提升迁移学习效率，在多个图像分类数据集上实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型计算需求大，传统微调方法更新所有参数容易导致过拟合和计算成本高，需要更高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 使用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，选择性微调相关层而不是所有参数，减少可训练参数数量。

Result: 在9个不同领域的图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法实现了竞争性或改进的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 通过集中微调过程在相关层子集上，BioTune降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3DGS压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的条件解码以适应场景变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能将中等规模场景压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合的长期归档，且缺乏适应归档后场景变化的机制。

Method: 提出图像条件高斯溅射量化器(ICGS-Quantizer)，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨训练场景的共享码本，通过基于图像的条件解码实现场景重构。

Result: ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将3DGS存储需求降低到千字节范围同时保持视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了3DGS的压缩效率，解决了长期归档的存储限制问题，并提供了适应归档后场景变化的有效机制。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，专门针对驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人等动态物体和大规模静态背景，现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽略了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且缺乏准确的几何表示。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景划分为近、中、远区域以增强近距离细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯建模非刚性动态物体，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验监督整个框架，提高几何结构准确性。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上进行了严格评估，在驾驶场景的新视角合成方面展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦方法和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的挑战，实现了高质量的新视角渲染和准确的几何表示。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在瓶颈，RPM问题作为权威测试标准，本文旨在通过解决RPM问题来提升机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用"因果链模型"视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计基线模型DIO。实验发现互信息最大化存在限制后，逐步提出三种改进方法来充分利用前置知识。

Result: 实验证明基线模型DIO的优化目标无法让模型真正掌握人类推理逻辑，主要原因是互信息作为统计量无法抓取因果关系，且下界紧密性影响效果。

Conclusion: 通过因果链模型视角和逐步改进方法，本文为提升深度学习模型的抽象推理能力提供了有效途径，特别是在充分利用前置知识方面。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Motivation: 短视频内容兴起需要高效视频摘要技术，但现有方法难以捕捉全局时序依赖和保持语义连贯性，且多通道特征融合易受噪声影响。

Method: 设计基于脉冲神经网络的关键帧提取器，引入动态聚合图推理器进行细粒度推理，提出变分推理重建模块使用ELBO优化处理特征融合不确定性。

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等多个数据集上超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SpiVG网络有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和计算效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Method: 通过理论分析推导线性MAE学习的特征，研究掩码比例和补丁大小如何选择空间相关性特征，并将分析扩展到非线性MAE，验证MAE表示如何适应数据集的空间相关性。

Result: 研究发现MAE能够学习输入图像的空间相关性，掩码比例和补丁大小可以控制学习短程和长程空间相关性的特征，非线性MAE能够适应超越二阶统计量的数据集空间相关性。

Conclusion: 该研究为MAE超参数选择提供了理论依据和实践指导，揭示了MAE如何通过空间相关性学习实现有效的表示学习，有助于在实际应用中更好地配置MAE模型。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 提出的双向时间信息传播方法能有效利用局部和全局时间信息，在红外小目标检测任务中取得优异性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and

multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR是一个基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练技术，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务面临语义帧级对齐和复杂依赖关系建模的挑战，需要开发能够捕获语义上下文和时间细节的精确定位模型。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用基于Transformer的双阶段序列对齐机制，将目标视频表示条件化于查询视频特征，并采用自监督预训练技术进行任务特定初始化。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频到视频时刻检索任务上取得了显著的性能提升，证明了其在捕获语义和时间信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯拟合方法，能够从极稀疏视图输入中同时估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，在仅2张训练图像的极稀疏条件下实现了显著的渲染质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯拟合方法依赖于密集多视图输入和精确相机位姿，在极稀疏视图条件下SfM方法失败，导致渲染质量下降。

Method: 提出密集立体模块进行相机位姿估计和全局点云初始化，使用协调视图插值模块生成额外监督信号，并引入多尺度拉普拉斯正则化和适应性空间正则化来提升质量。

Result: 在仅2张训练图像的极稀疏条件下，PSNR持续提升2.75dB，合成图像呈现最小化扭曲和丰富的高频细节，视觉质量显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在极稀疏视图条件下的初始化问题，为缺乏密集多视图输入的实际应用场景提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一个轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过异构内核和稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支，在保持低计算开销的同时实现最先进性能，并在零样本泛化测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用局部和全局双多尺度框架，使用异构层内内核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上的零样本泛化测试中保持优异性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet在资源有限的医疗场景中具有实际部署潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像进行3D穿衣人体重建的新方法，通过多视角联合优化提升单视角ECON方法的几何和姿态估计能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角3D人体重建方法在几何细节和身体姿态估计方面存在局限，需要利用多视角信息来提高重建质量和一致性

Method: 提出联合多视角身体优化(JMBO)算法，跨所有输入视图拟合单个SMPL-X身体模型，保持多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节；整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉服装褶皱和发型等细节

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度方面持续提升，与现代少样本3D重建方法相比具有竞争力

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，无需网络重新训练即可实现多视角增益，为穿衣人体3D重建提供了有效的多视角解决方案

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习实现任务泛化，在保持低计算成本的同时提供卓越的融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种能够处理不同场景和任务的通用融合框架。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效多模态融合，实现跨域的空间和频率融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光图像融合、多焦点图像融合、多曝光图像融合和医学图像融合四个任务上的广泛实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效解决了多模态图像融合中的关键挑战，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为多模态图像融合提供了有效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过创新的Road Surface Gaussian表示和Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体，并使用自监督不确定性估计来选择性整合生成先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从记录的驾驶日志合成外推视图对自动驾驶模拟至关重要，但现有方法使用生成先验作为伪地面真值往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的Road Surface Gaussian表示、使用可学习缩放因子的Far Field Gaussians处理远距离物体，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性整合生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提高了外推视图的真实感和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的几何一致性和渲染质量问题，为自动驾驶模拟提供了更真实的场景生成能力。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程处理多对象交互和复杂运动，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)细化动画，预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的复杂多对象草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，有效解决了多对象交互和复杂运动的动画生成问题。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度窄路分割的网络，通过差分注意力扩张提取、双流解码融合和多尺度扩张策略，显著提升了窄路提取的准确性和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 窄路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过拟合到一般道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；双流解码融合机制平衡空间精度和语义上下文；多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件分布，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，导致决策边界不可靠和预测校准不足。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优异的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏差问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理。现有方法主要通过架构修改或特殊激活函数解决，本文提出通过直接指导训练过程的新方向

Method: 两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码，自适应地为局部变化强烈的像素分配更高权重，鼓励模型早期关注精细细节；第二阶段过渡到全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，本工作为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有的半定规划松弛方法求解点云配准问题需要数百秒时间，效率低下，需要更快速的可证明全局最优解法

Method: 采用线性时间凸松弛和contractor方法来加速分支定界算法，在给定旋转轴的情况下求解截断最小二乘问题

Result: 能够在0.5秒内求解100个点的3D点云配准问题，比STRIDE SDP求解器快两个数量级，并提供全局最优性证明

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准问题的求解效率，虽然目前不能解决完整的6自由度问题，但在旋转轴已知的情况下表现出色

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案三个创新，解决了现有视频LLM在时间感知精度上的局限性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得显著进展，但在时间感知上仍显粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离关注实体。

Method: 1) 扩散时间潜在(DTL)编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时间一致性；2) 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3) 混合令牌方案使用离散时间令牌提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了模型的强大接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三个关键创新设计，显著提升了视频LLM的时间感知精度和实体对齐能力，为细粒度时间推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA

Motivation: 解决机载光达数据树木分割中的数据变异性问题和精确标签数据获取成本高的挑战

Method: 使用人工评分作为弱监督标签，训练评分模型分类分割质量，然后用评分模型的反馈精细调整分割模型

Result: 实现了34%的树木实例识别提升，显著减少了非树木实例预测数量

Conclusion: 方法在密林区域表现良好，但在疏林区小树或复杂环境中性能有所下降

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击中无需目标模型信息，在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN数据集上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性的观察，提出CFG方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构都可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD是一个多级跨模态知识蒸馏框架，通过Teacher-Coach-Student范式将多模态融合模型的知识迁移到轻量级视觉学生模型中，显著提升在线高清地图构建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线高清地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致推理时计算开销大且受限于过时地图信息。需要开发更高效、低成本的视觉中心方法。

Method: 提出MapKD框架：1）多模态融合教师模型；2）视觉中心教练模型桥接跨模态知识迁移；3）轻量级视觉学生模型。引入TGPD和MSRD两种知识蒸馏策略进行特征对齐和语义学习指导。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型性能提升+6.68 mIoU和+10.94 mAP，同时加速推理速度。

Conclusion: MapKD通过知识蒸馏成功将多模态模型知识迁移到轻量级视觉模型，实现了高性能、高效率的在线高清地图构建，为自动驾驶系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏细节立面元素，而传统手工建模方式难以大规模应用，需要自动化的LoD3模型重建方法

Method: 使用冲突地图(CMs)进行语义分割，结合人工智能生成的语义冲突地图生成器(SCMG)，并通过信心度评分融合素材模型的分割结果

Result: 方法能够有效分割和重建建筑窗户门洞等立面元素，紧密融合素材模型分割后达到61%的性能表现

Conclusion: 该研究推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的发展，为可扩展和高效的3D城市建模链平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出MDPR框架，通过多维度动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token与通用查询token之间的注意力分数来压缩KV缓存，同时维护固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到了最先进的性能，并与查询感知压缩方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: StreamMem为长视频理解和多轮对话场景提供了一种高效的内存压缩解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，导致在长序列中对象结构和运动出现累积错误，需要解决长视频生成中的结构和时间一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在计算病理学中面临细粒度语义分割的挑战，特别是在识别特定细胞亚型方面存在局限，需要开发更精确且标注效率更高的方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能的标注减少像素级标注需求；2）通过SAM适配器增强语义特异性；3）整合分子导向校正学习（MOCL）提高分割精度。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据，显式解耦形状和骨骼基，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过骨骼基础的解耦方法实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在提高样本质量的同时最大化组多样性，解决了生成模型中独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实应用中，用户通常需要查看多个输出样本（如4-8个），但传统的独立采样方法往往产生冗余结果，限制了用户选择并阻碍创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率，可扩展到大型候选集。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提高了组多样性和质量。框架可泛化到文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等多种任务。

Conclusion: 该框架使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本，为实际应用提供了更有效的多样本生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

*Haonan Qiu,Ning Yu,Ziqi Huang,Paul Debevec,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale是一种无需训练即可实现高分辨率视觉生成的新型推理范式，支持8K图像生成和4K视频生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉扩散模型受限于训练分辨率和计算资源，无法生成高质量高分辨率内容，且现有方法容易产生重复模式和质量问题

Method: 针对不同类型视频生成架构提出专用变体，基于先进开源视频生成框架实现高分辨率I2V和V2V合成

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展高分辨率视觉生成能力方面的优越性，无需微调即可实现8K图像生成，仅需最小LoRA微调即可实现4K视频生成

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率生成中的高频信息增加和重复模式问题，显著提升了视觉生成质量

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

### [121] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上表现出更好的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，而本文希望建立一个完全在频谱域中运行的推理框架，以数学基础更扎实的方式整合符号逻辑和神经推理。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，并映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则落地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上的实验显示，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建稳健且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算效率高的计算基底。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示计算框架，其中描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互序列中共同涌现，而不是传统强化学习中分离的状态表示和奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面应该从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等效经验分布的类别，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨不同基质的目性行为提供了统一的理论基础，挑战了传统分离的状态表示和奖励函数模型，强调从经验中共同涌现的世界模型构建方式。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商，有效减少流行度偏见并提升推荐多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众但优质的旅游目的地得到关注

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）分别生成推荐，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和精炼，惩罚重复或无关响应

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab-REC相比单智能体基线显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够发现常被忽视的小众旅游地点

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型控制群体动画中的代理人移动，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航实现更现实的社交交互和群体行为出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法很少考虑语言和对话对人类导航行为的影响，交互主要限于导航和固定目标识别，需要更现实的社交交互模拟。

Method: 方法包含对话系统和语言驱动导航两个主要组件。周期性查询代理中心的LLM（条件包括人物性格、角色、渴望、关系）来生成代理间对话，然后使用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个代理的导航和行进。

Result: 在复杂场景中验证方法，观察到代理自动组队和解散，方法作为群体内信息传递机制。框架产生了更现实的群体模拟，在任何环境设置中自然出现出群体行为。

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM的语言驱动方法，成功实现了基于感知输入和进行中对话的动态决策，产生了更现实的群体动画和自然出现的群体行为。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现推理预算增加反而损害LLM置信度校准，检索增强生成比纯推理表现更好，信息访问是置信度校准的关键瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为问答工具时的置信度校准问题，研究推理能力和计算预算如何影响置信度评估准确性

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下的LLM置信度校准表现，比较纯推理与检索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会系统性导致过度自信，检索增强生成达到89.3%准确率

Conclusion: 信息访问而非推理深度或推理预算是改进知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据且模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型使用LoRA等参数高效微调技术时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐性，导致不安全行为。现有安全感知适应方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调模型检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架，包含MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性，设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层，并对这些层进行后剪枝处理。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改进效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙辅助游戏中有效解决了目标推断问题

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question

achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient

preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个针对罕见疾病多汗症的开源LLM框架，通过数据增强、微调和专家评估三阶段流程，为患者提供准确的诊断、个性化治疗建议和情感支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用受到罕见疾病数据稀缺和不可靠的限制，多汗症作为影响2-3%人口的罕见疾病，目前缺乏专门的LLM支持系统。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1）使用前沿LLM从开源数据生成医学上合理的合成病例；2）在增强数据集上微调开源基础模型；3）临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和同理心，并通过验证响应迭代丰富数据集。

Result: 实验表明LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，为其他具有类似数据可信度挑战的罕见疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个可信赖且具有同理心的多汗症支持系统，为解决罕见疾病LLM应用中的数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的推广价值。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能，发现约束交互是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在严格资源、时间和操作约束下的推理可靠性尚未充分研究，需要系统评估模型在高约束环境下的表现。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，在资源约束项目调度问题中逐步增加非冗余前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，使用有向无环图进行测试。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度。

Conclusion: 模型在干净合成数据上的表现不能保证在领域实际场景中的泛化能力，凸显了大语言模型在复杂约束推理中的有限泛化性。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然擅长生成逼真图像，但在处理流程图等需要精确空间对齐和符号结构的图表时表现不佳，需要一种能够保持全局约束和可编辑性的解决方案。

Method: 使用训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批判VLM提出编辑建议，多个LLM候选生成SVG更新，评判VLM选择最佳结果。

Result: 在10个论文流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能够精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法通过程序化SVG输出实现了高质量草图到图表的转换，具有良好的可扩展性和人机协作能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型代理在处理大量历史交互数据时的挑战，现有记忆模块存储内容质量差，影响回忆性能和响应质量。

Method: 设计受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段匹配相关检索记忆单元，获取对应上下文记忆作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上进行实验，与三种其他方法相比，证明了方法的有效性。消融学习实验确认了记忆单元的合理性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆机制的LLM智能体主要依赖单粒度记忆，受限于经验收集质量，限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性

Method: 将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集，然后从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示，在推理时检索任务相关经验和提示支持规划，遇到异常时通过细粒度关键信息进行自问答反思和计划修正

Result: 该框架能够充分利用记忆实现灵活的场景适应

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的性能和适应性

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过相似性搜索实现更准确的信用分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且模式有限，偏好易收集但信用分配困难

Method: 提出搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案，为偏好标注轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上，优于同时利用两种反馈类型的现有方法

Conclusion: SPW方法有效统一了偏好和演示两种反馈源，解决了传统方法难以实现的准确信用分配问题

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架来解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素考虑和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实世界旅行规划的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略多样化的环境因素和用户偏好，限制计划的可行性；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策制定，并考虑环境感知确保计划可行性。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理复杂的旅行规划任务。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 真实世界旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架提供了有希望的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的新方法。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，利用语言建模能力建模时序动态；在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLMs中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的思维链推理在处理复杂逻辑任务时表现良好，但过长的推理链会导致过度思考、计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 建立显式的块结构范式：先预测推理预算（块数），然后分区推理；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制深度。

Result: 提出了能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的框架，实现了从零推理到深度推理的灵活调节。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理长度的动态控制，提升了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

TL;DR: DeepThink3D通过组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的3D问题，并使用DPO优化LLM的工具使用策略，提升在复杂3D场景推理中的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景推理中生成的程序推理链较短，主要原因是数据集问题过于简单，无法应对复杂的3D推理任务

Method: 1) 在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂问题；2) 通过微调LLM提升3D工具使用能力；3) 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)优化模型生成的工具链策略

Result: 增强了LLM在复杂3D场景推理中的工具使用能力，提高了复杂任务中的准确性

Conclusion: DeepThink3D通过问题复杂化和策略优化，显著提升了LLM在3D场景中的复杂推理能力

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

*Ahmed Nasir,Abdelhafid Zenati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于动力系统理论的强化学习策略验证框架，通过有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，为安全关键系统提供形式化安全验证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要开发能够验证学习策略鲁棒性和安全性的框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入定量指标MBR、ASAS、TASAS来测量策略安全边界。

Result: 实验表明该框架能够全面评估策略行为，成功识别仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略，提供局部稳定性保证并处理模型不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了可解释的安全评估方法，通过动力系统理论工具实现了对策略安全性和鲁棒性的形式化验证。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

TL;DR: Agentics是一个模块化框架，用于构建基于代理的系统，支持结构化推理和组合泛化，通过数据建模而非提示工程来实现逻辑转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统AI工作流中需要大量手工设计提示的问题，提供一个更专注于数据建模的声明式框架，使开发者能够更高效地构建复杂的AI应用。

Method: 通过将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理来实现逻辑转换，LLM提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换进行组合，连接类型时由LLM执行。

Result: 在领域特定的多项选择题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中实现了最先进的准确性或改进的可扩展性，且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了一种新的数据建模方法，通过逻辑转换和组合泛化，显著提高了开发效率和系统性能，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块相似性，并保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 开发了基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理管道将大型文档内容添加到记忆库，创建基于向量标记表示检索整个记忆块的机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆能力），同时使先前ACT-R模型只需很少修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统的优势，同时保持了与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性，未来将改进时间上下文表示并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化智能体在合作中的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估个体贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体强化学习系统中，缺乏价值反馈时难以评估个体智能体的贡献程度，需要一种仅通过策略分布就能分析智能体行为的方法。

Method: 基于信息论Shapley值，通过测量智能体动作对队友策略决策不确定性和偏好对齐的影响，量化其对合作同伴工具性赋能的因果影响力。

Result: 在合作和竞争环境中验证了方法的有效性，能够识别哪些行为通过促进确定性决策或保持行动灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为MARL系统提供了新的合作动态洞察，增强了系统的可解释性，无需依赖价值函数即可分析智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据从摄入到部署的递归价值链动态，以及这种动态如何挑战负责任AI的现有框架，需要从技术哲学角度提供新的分析工具。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，引入基于Simondon技术哲学的概念工具，将AI流程重新概念化为包括前个体环境、个体化和个体化AI的生命周期模型，并提出"未来性"概念来描述AI的自我强化循环。

Result: 开发了一个技术上扎实且哲学上连贯的分析框架，揭示了监管盲点，识别了技术寡头通过捕获、训练和部署基础设施集中价值和决策权所导致的权力不对称加剧问题。

Conclusion: 有效的AI监管必须解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议采取生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI用户采用加速，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但目前缺乏在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标的研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，在谷歌大规模AI生产环境中测量AI推理工作负载的能源使用、碳排放和水消耗，考虑了完整的AI服务基础设施栈。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示中位数消耗0.24Wh能量，比观看9秒电视能耗更低，消耗0.26mL水（相当于5滴水）。谷歌的软件效率努力和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹降低44倍。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注。全面测量AI服务环境指标对于准确比较模型和在完整AI服务栈中激励效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Method: 重新调整最新语言模型构建响应评估框架，在实时对话中识别假社交线索，使用30个合成对话数据集进行测试

Result: 迭代评估在宽松一致性规则下成功检测所有假社交对话且无误报，检测多在前几轮对话中完成

Conclusion: 评估代理为防止假社交关系提供了可行解决方案，展示了初步证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性且将各维度独立处理，而自动化方法难以动态适应和进行语义推理。

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架，包含提议配置变更的Advisor、评估进展的Evaluator和优化决策过程的Optimizer，通过文本梯度（定性反馈信号）提供语义理解。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的智能优化，有效解决了配置优化中的动态适应性和语义推理问题，为机器学习配置优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要嵌入强大的伦理推理能力，以确保在常规和紧急操作中做出道德决策，这是实现广泛采用的关键。

Method: 分层安全强化学习框架：决策层使用包含碰撞概率和伤害严重性的复合伦理风险成本训练Safe RL智能体；执行层采用多项式路径规划和PID+Stanley控制器实现平滑轨迹；动态优先经验回放机制强化高风险事件学习。

Result: 在包含多样化车辆、骑行者和行人的真实交通数据集上验证，证明该方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过安全强化学习在真实场景中研究自动驾驶伦理决策的工作，展示了结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习在复杂人车混合交通环境中推进伦理可问责自主性的潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

<details>

Motivation: 由于患者群体和临床环境的巨大差异，没有单一模型在所有队列中表现最佳，需要个性化方法来解决这一挑战

Method: 两阶段代理管道：1) 使用FAISS基于相似性搜索在9个真实世界队列中检索最相关患者群体；2) 使用LLM根据检索到的队列和性能指标，从8个代表性模型中选择最优预测算法

Result: 开发了支持灵活、群体驱动的模型选择架构，能够在多样化临床人群中实现个性化风险评估

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了实用路径，通过动态模型选择适应不同患者特征

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，通过分层混合神经架构搜索和自适应变异策略，有效解决文本分类中NAS搜索空间过大和冗余的问题，在Spider数据集上测试准确率提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间过大且冗余，导致强化学习模型无法有效导航搜索空间。扁平架构搜索导致搜索空间无序，难以遍历。

Method: 引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间。采用自适应变异策略，通过Q-learning根据先前迭代的性能反馈动态调整，实现概率化搜索空间探索。

Result: 在数据库ID预测任务中，该方法能够持续发现高性能架构。在Spider数据集上，测试准确率相比现有基线方法提升8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控拒绝抑制来解决DPO的过拟合和崩溃问题，在多个任务上表现优于DPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然简单稳定，但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要更好的偏好优化算法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出LPO框架：1）梯度解耦，用绝对差异损失替代log-sigmoid函数；2）偏移约束和正则化项保持响应质量；3）可控拒绝抑制，通过梯度分离和可调系数线性调节拒绝概率。

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上，LPO均表现出比DPO更好的性能。

Conclusion: LPO是一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，作者公开了源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个面向广告推荐的全表征多粒度迁移框架，通过迁移用户表征、物品表征和交叉表征，并采用多粒度机制提升迁移效果，在腾讯广告平台实现显著GMV提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了物品表征和用户-物品交叉表征的价值，且简单将用户表征作为下游特征使用，未能有效弥合上下游差距和利用更多迁移粒度

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移用户、物品和交叉三种表征；2）识别最优提取层并聚合交叉表征；3）采用多粒度机制：非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）、独立检索（模型级）

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理每日数百亿样本，模型参数达TB级。自2024年Q4上线以来，在微信朋友圈和视频号等主要广告场景实现10+次成功上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业级广告推荐中取得了显著的业务效果和经济效益

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种课程引导的蒙地卡罗随机集成掩码自编码器，用于恢复大气遥感数据中的精细尺度特征，学习数据驱动的先验分布，并量化像素级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据（如多普勒激光雷达、雷达和辐射计）经常受到低信噪比、距离折叠和虚假不连续性的影响。传统间隙填充方法会模糊精细尺度结构，而深度模型缺乏置信度估计。

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例训练策略，迫使ViT解码器从逐渐稀疏的上下文中进行重建。在推理时，通过蒙地卡罗方法对随机掩码实现进行采样，多次评估MAE并聚合输出，获得后验预测均值重建和像素级不确定性图。

Result: 能够恢复上升气流和下沉气流核心、切变线和小涡旋等精细尺度特征，同时提供高保真重建和不确定性量化。

Conclusion: 该深度学习工作流程支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化，并改善长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic
demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly
outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and

Method: 提出生成平衡算子(GEOs)，使用有限维深度平衡层来逼近无限维希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题解。输入是光滑凸损失函数，输出是相应的优化问题近似解。

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论参数需求与实验证据之间的差距，为无限维凸优化问题提供了高效的近似方法，参数需求仅为对数级增长，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该系统通过创新的静态分析与搜索算法结合，有效解决了大型模型分片的复杂性问题，提供了更高效、更可靠的自动化分片方案

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot) 是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过并行训练两个模型并周期性重置均值来估计局部不确定性，从而提供正则化效果并改善泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，在过参数化和低数据量场景下容易过拟合。传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中存在训练成本高、无法指导学习过程以及非凸优化中假设不成立等问题。

Method: 并行训练两个相同模型于独立的bootstrap样本上，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地中，利用它们的差异来估计局部不确定性，并在训练过程中使用该估计进行自适应权重采样以实现正则化。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法改善了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功地将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化机制和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

### [175] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异构腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，针对不同样本具有已知但不同的腐败概率的情况，给出了多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布均值估计的紧致极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习、众包和传感器网络等应用中，样本腐败率存在结构性异质性，但现有鲁棒估计方法通常假设均匀或最坏情况腐败，忽略了这种异质性结构。

Method: 针对多元有界分布、单变量高斯分布的均值估计，以及多元高斯均值估计和线性回归问题，建立了异构腐败模式下的极小极大率理论框架。

Result: 获得了所有异构腐败模式的紧致极小极大率，对于多元高斯均值估计和线性回归，建立了平方误差的极小极大率（达到√d因子）。发现最优估计器可以丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本。

Conclusion: 异构腐败率下的鲁棒估计存在明确的性能界限，最优估计策略需要根据腐败率的经验分布确定样本丢弃阈值，这为实际应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

### [176] [Enhancing Optimizer Stability: Momentum Adaptation of The NGN Step-size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15071)
*Rustem Islamov,Niccolo Ajroldi,Antonio Orvieto,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NGN-M算法，结合动量与NGN步长方法，在保持最优性能的同时显著提升对步长超参数的鲁棒性，无需严格假设条件即可达到标准收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数（特别是步长）选择高度敏感，调参困难且耗时。需要开发更稳定的优化器来减少对超参数选择的依赖。

Method: 提出NGN-M算法，将NGN步长方法与动量机制相结合，在不需要插值条件或有界随机梯度等严格假设的情况下实现优化。

Result: NGN-M达到了标准O(1/√K)收敛率，实验表明其对步长超参数选择具有更强鲁棒性，性能达到或超越现有最优化器。

Conclusion: NGN-M算法成功解决了优化器对步长超参数敏感的问题，在保持高性能的同时提供了更好的稳定性，为深度学习优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Yen-Lung Lai,Zhe Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度神经网络在过参数化状态下的泛化行为，揭示了输出特征空间坍缩现象，并提出"虫洞"解决方案来绕过退化问题，为理解DNN泛化提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"愚弄样本"现象（DNN对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类），探索DNN泛化行为的理论基础，弥补理论与实践的差距。

Method: 基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免依赖梯度优化和显式标签的传统数值方法，研究过参数化状态下DNN的输出特征空间坍缩现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现输出特征空间坍缩，虽然改善泛化但最终导致退化状态（不同输入映射到相同输出）；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能够绕过退化，调和随机输入与有意义标签。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新见解，揭示了学习动态中的关键现象，并为无监督学习环境下的理论研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实际应用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了新的干预方法APP，在概念级控制方面优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中神经元的多义性（一个神经元对多个不相关概念产生响应）是模型可解释性的主要障碍。虽然稀疏自编码器被认为能促进单义性，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上评估。提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了两种干预策略：全神经元掩码和部分抑制，以及新的APP方法（基于后验概率的衰减）。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并获得了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性，且常常损害下游性能。SAE在部分抑制策略下能实现更精确的概念级控制，APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器在促进神经元单义性方面有效，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间权衡。新提出的APP方法为精确的概念级干预提供了有效工具，推动了大型语言模型的可解释性研究。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数设计框架内集成SSM主干、稀疏全局注意力、分块MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长上下文语言模型在效率、容量和记忆能力方面的挑战，提出一个模块化、输入自适应的架构方案，结合多种先进技术的优势。

Method: 集成Mamba风格SSM主干网络，间歇性稀疏全局注意力，分块级MoE前馈路由，以及工作记忆+事实PKM的双记忆系统，采用分阶段课程学习策略。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化长上下文语言模型提供了一个蓝图框架，结合了SSM效率、稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术被开发用于防止生成特定不良概念。然而现有CETs的有效性和鲁棒性缺乏系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含分层和组合提示词的数据集，通过自动化评估流程从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄露。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词轻松绕过，存在属性泄露问题，并表现出注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前概念擦除技术存在严重安全漏洞和副作用，需要更鲁棒的概念擦除方法。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Motivation: 随着机器学习普及和数据隐私法规发展，从训练模型中移除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要。现有方法通常需要访问完整训练数据集，但在实际场景中原始数据可能无法获取。

Method: 基于近期研究，提出了一种估计未知剩余训练数据Hessian矩阵的方法，这是高效遗忘的关键组件。利用该估计技术实现零样本遗忘。

Result: 方法在广泛数据集上的实验验证了其有效性，能够在保持剩余数据性能的同时提供稳健的理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了源无关场景下的模型遗忘问题，为实际应用中的隐私保护需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架缺乏统一的数学抽象，无法有效处理复杂的异步分布式计算场景。作者希望通过范畴论工具为RL建立更强大和通用的理论基础。

Method: 使用范畴论和余代数理论，将MDPs、POMDPs、PSRs等动态系统模型统一为特殊类型的余代数。通过函子范畴和拓扑斯理论建模算法空间，将RL中的固定点寻找问题推广为异步确定最终余代数。

Conclusion: URL框架为强化学习提供了强大的数学基础，能够统一处理各种动态系统模型和异步分布式计算场景，是RL理论的重要扩展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 揭示了差分隐私机器学习可复现性的特殊挑战（如DP噪声带来的额外随机性），提出了科学有效和可靠结果的最佳实践

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于反学习的防御框架，通过三阶段流程（动态检测、有害内容追踪、约束优化）来消除大语言模型中的有害知识，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过对齐机制，导致大语言模型产生有害内容，严重威胁模型安全性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 混合方法动态检测不安全输出；2) 通过前馈网络激活进行词级有害内容追踪；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量。

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持高性能，相比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 反学习是构建可扩展和有效大语言模型安全性的有前景方向。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Result: 该框架提供了标准化流程并支持可重复评估，为推进数据级公平性研究提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，为数据级公平性研究提供了重要的评估工具和基础架构。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种多归因学习框架(MAL)，通过整合多种归因视角的信号来改善转化率预测性能，而非像传统方法那样仅使用单一归因机制的标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业平台支持多种归因机制，但传统方法仅使用单一生产关键归因机制的标签进行模型训练，忽略了其他归因视角的补充信号。

Method: 设计了包含两个核心组件的联合学习框架：归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主要目标预测器(PTP)。AKA通过多任务学习整合多种归因标签的知识，PTP则专注于生产系统优化归因指标的准确转化概率预测。还提出了CAT训练策略，利用所有归因标签组合的卡尔积来生成丰富的监督信号。

Result: 离线评估显示MAL在GAUC指标上比单归因学习基线提升0.51%，在线实验显示投资回报率(ROI)提高2.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究成功展示了通过整合多种归因视角来改善转化率预测的效果，MAL框架能够在保持与工业部署要求直接兼容的同时，充分利用不同归因机制提供的补充信息。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

TL;DR: 提出基于局部最优性保证的框架，用于合成黑盒机器学习模型的帕累托最优解释，平衡准确性和可解释性，解决了现有方法在可扩展性和最优性保证方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒机器学习模型解释需要平衡准确性和可解释性这两个冲突目标，现有方法要么缺乏帕累托最优性保证，要么面临严重的可扩展性问题。

Method: 使用多目标学习或搜索技术（如多目标蒙特卡洛树搜索）生成帕累托最优候选集，然后通过SAT求解器将每个候选的局部最优性验证转化为布尔可满足性问题。

Result: 在基准测试中证明该方法有效，生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法合成的解释非常接近。

Conclusion: 基于局部最优性保证的框架能够更可扩展地合成帕累托最优解释，在保持高质量的同时解决了可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督对比学习方法只能生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录中丰富的时间结构信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: 采用多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计方法最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变性的生理特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类任务中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Method: 利用模型内部置信度信号在生成过程中或生成后动态过滤低质量推理轨迹，无需额外模型训练或超参数调优

Conclusion: DeepConf是一种简单而强大的方法，可无缝集成到现有服务框架中，显著提升推理效率和性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think
with Confidence (DeepConf), a simple yet powerful method that enhances both
reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

TL;DR: 本研究批判性评估了CSG复杂度指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其对参数敏感且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的结构和语义复杂度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但现有的CSG指标在KG环境中尚未得到验证，需要系统评估其有效性和提出更好的复杂度度量方法。

Method: 在多元关系链接预测背景下检验CSG指标，结合transformer生成的语义表示，引入并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关，而图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中缺乏稳定性和泛化预测能力，需要开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained

outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI

Result: 该方法能够有效处理原本计算不可行的大型线性问题

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法为DeepONet训练提供了高效的计算解决方案，特别适用于大规模问题和物理信息学习场景

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced

efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多元高斯聚类重叠检测方法，专门用于数据流在线学习中的重叠聚类检测和合并


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线数据流学习需要处理概念漂移，可能导致大量重叠聚类需要合并。现有分布差异度量方法无法有效处理所有形状的聚类且计算成本高

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相似性度量方法，计算速度更快，能够避免正交聚类的错误合并

Result: 该方法比现有方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交聚类的误合并

Conclusion: 提出的重叠检测方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类合并提供了高效可靠的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换有效解决了机器遗忘中的根本限制，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 该模型成功结合了生物启发行为和数学稳定性，为开发更一般的精确可解模型提供了理论基础，可用于模拟任意物理设备并实现稳定的脑启发计算。

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，验证速度平均提升2.3倍，最高达4.1倍，分析时间从24小时缩短至6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过分组验证策略有效提升了神经网络局部鲁棒性验证的效率和可扩展性

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

TL;DR: HypSeek是一个双曲表示学习框架，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入到洛伦兹模型双曲空间中，通过利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，在虚拟筛选和亲和力排名任务上取得了显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的欧几里得嵌入方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，使用双曲表示学习在洛伦兹模型双曲空间中嵌入分子数据，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构来增强表示结构

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排名相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，在虚拟筛选和亲和力排名两个任务上都表现出显著优势

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在各种基于图的公平性任务中具有有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 通过优化伪任务中的公平性可以有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用的公平性泛化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is

the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the

results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的私有训练机制，通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式逼近损失函数，相比DP-SGD在计算效率和稳定性方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且稳定性差，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户隐私保护训练机制

Method: SPOF通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式逼近模型的训练损失函数，为每个用户的数据添加校准噪声到多项式系数中，而非直接扰动梯度

Result: 在无线体域网场景下，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在异构用户数据和信道噪声环境下表现稳定

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中实现了更好的隐私-效用权衡，具有更高的计算效率和鲁棒性，特别适合存在环境噪声的实际应用场景

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 该方法在具有挑战性的错误指定环境中提供了改进的可扩展性和适用性，同时保持优异的推理性能。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型缺乏长期记忆能力，无法在持续学习中保持先前学习的主题知识。

Method: 使用全局先验分布持续更新的方法，使模型能够在后续时间步连续学习主题模型而不遗忘先前内容。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面持续优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好捕捉时间变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM填补了持续学习中主题模型的空白，提供了有效的在线学习能力同时保持长期记忆，在主题建模任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种新的机器学习框架，通过可证公平的初始化和公平保持训练算法，形式保证个体公平性在整个训练过程中的维持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的机器学习公平性方法少有形式保证，而验证技术不能在训练过程中主动提升公平性，因此需要一种能够在整个训练过程中形式保证个体公平性的方法。

Method: 该方法包括两部分：(1)可证公平的初始化，确保模型在公平状态下开始；(2)公平保持训练算法，在模型学习过程中维持公平性。关键技术是使用随机响应机制来保护敏感属性同时维持公平保证。

Result: 实验评估证明该方法有效，能够生成经验上公平且准确的模型。同时，该方法比基于认证训练的替代方法更加高效。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种能够在整个机器学习训练过程中形式保证个体公平性的框架，充分解决了当前公平性方法缺乏形式保证的问题。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Motivation: 解决稀疏采样下精确剂量反应预测的挑战，传统方法开发周期长且需要专家建模，需要更高效的个性化给药方案

Method: 使用Transformer架构结合机制性先验和摊销式贝叶斯推理，预训练数十万合成药代动力学轨迹，利用Ornstein-Uhlenbeck先验和室模型参数

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构为定制药代动力学建模提供了新选择，为实现真正群体感知的个性化给药方案开辟了道路

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放式多段环境来研究社会智能对AI代理学习的助推作用，而现实世界环境中的人类专家和隐式合作可以帮助AI代理学习适应性能力。

Method: 设计了一个多自利段可以追求复杂独立目标的环境，反映现实世界挑战，并在这个环境中研究社会学习的影响。

Result: 环境能够支持研究社会智能AI代理的发展，包括隐式合作对抗共同敌人、建设和共享工具、实现长期限目标等行为。

Conclusion: 该环境为研究多段社会智能AI代理提供了实验基础，有助于探索合作与竞争在学习过程中的作用。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PECANN-CAPU框架通过多项改进提升物理约束神经网络求解PDE的能力：多惩罚参数ALM、期望约束执行、傅里叶特征映射、时间窗口策略和条件自适应惩罚更新策略，在多个基准问题上达到竞争性精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进PECANN框架以更好地学习偏微分方程的解，解决现有方法在约束执行、内存效率、多尺度特征处理和时间演化方面的局限性。

Method: 1) 推广增广拉格朗日法支持多惩罚参数；2) 将点约束和拉格朗日乘子重构为期望形式；3) 引入傅里叶特征映射处理多尺度特征；4) 时间窗口策略确保长时间演化的连续性；5) 提出条件自适应惩罚更新策略(CAPU)。

Conclusion: 这些改进显著提升了PECANN框架的鲁棒性、效率和科学计算中苛刻问题的适用性，为物理约束神经网络提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了D-Wave量子退火器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能上的微小差异，提出混合采样方法但未改善RBM训练效果，但发现量子采样在缓解灾难性遗忘方面具有潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何先前研究中D-Wave量子采样未能显著改善受限玻尔兹曼机(RBM)的训练效果，并探索量子采样在机器学习其他应用中的潜在价值。

Method: 采用混合采样方法结合经典MCMC和量子退火采样，分析两种采样方法在概率分布不同区域的差异，并测试在灾难性遗忘缓解中的应用效果。

Result: 混合采样方法未能改善RBM训练效果，因为量子采样主要在概率分布的中低概率区域有差异，这些区域对采样质量影响较小。但在灾难性遗忘缓解方面，量子采样生成大量不同期望模式的速度和潜力显示出可比拟经典方法的效率。

Conclusion: 量子采样与经典采样在RBM训练中的差异不足以带来训练改善，但在生成多样化样本方面具有独特优势，特别在灾难性遗忘缓解等机器学习应用中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的分布式训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现高达1-3%的极低压缩比，在通信受限的LLM训练中显著优于全精度DiLoCo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境下（如跨数据中心）仍存在通信瓶颈，需要传输完整梯度副本，且性能略低于标准AdamW DDP基线。量化方法在LLM预训练中无法有效利用稀疏化，压缩效果有限。

Method: 提出SparseLoCo算法，结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似（误差反馈+激进稀疏化）和稀疏聚合来提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中实证表明，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均带来显著优势，能够实现1-3%稀疏度和2位量化的极端压缩比。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过创新的稀疏化和量化技术成功解决了分布式LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在保持甚至提升模型性能的同时大幅降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Motivation: 尽管似然在理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但实践中经常失败。研究旨在确定这是否是由于像素空间的问题，还是表示空间也存在密度估计能力不足的问题。

Method: 使用预训练的ResNet-18提取表示空间，然后训练变分扩散模型来估计数据似然，并与OpenOOD套件中的先进方法进行性能比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，在表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测器能够达到与最先进方法相当的性能，说明问题可能主要存在于像素空间而非表示空间。

Conclusion: 表示空间中的密度估计能够有效支持OOD检测，验证了似然作为OOD检测器的理论优势，并指出了像素空间密度估计的局限性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from

then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Motivation: 传统视频流使用有损压缩和速率自适应技术，但新兴的神经形态事件传感器产生异步像素采样数据，现有研究主要关注应用开发而忽略了数据传输这一关键问题。

Method: 调研事件视频系统现状，基于最近的Media Over QUIC协议草案开发新的低延迟事件流格式，并讨论可扩展事件流工作的技术问题。

Result: 提出了专门针对事件传感器异步数据特性的新型流媒体格式，解决了传统视频流技术不适用于事件数据传输的问题。

Conclusion: 事件传感器数据传输需要专门设计的流媒体协议，基于QUIC的新格式能够有效支持低延迟的事件流传输，为事件视频系统的实际部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的无监督三维CT超分辨率重建框架，利用激光散射模型生成高分辨率X光投影作为外部先验知识，结合三维高斯拟合技术来提升CT图像质量。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Abstract: This study comprehensively explores knowledge distillation frameworks for
COVID-19 and lung cancer classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images. We
employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision
Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a
compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our
approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with
teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000,
covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia,
lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ
Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning
process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the
distilled student model maintains high classification performance with
significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,
trustworthy medical AI solutions.

TL;DR: DoSReMC是一个针对乳腺X线摄影分类的批归一化适应框架，通过仅微调BN层和全连接层来提升跨域泛化能力，无需重新训练整个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在乳腺X线摄影图像分类中面临域偏移问题，导致模型在不同域数据上性能下降，限制了AI在临床环境中的安全公平部署。

Method: 提出DoSReMC框架，通过仅微调批归一化(BN)层和全连接(FC)层来适应域偏移，同时保留预训练的卷积滤波器。还集成了对抗训练方案来进一步提升跨域泛化能力。

Result: 实验证明BN层是域依赖性的主要来源，DoSReMC能有效提升模型在跨域场景下的性能，使用三个大规模FFDM数据集（包括新引入的HCTP数据集）进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: DoSReMC提供了一种实用的方法，可以轻松集成到现有AI流程中，应用于不同的临床环境，为实现更鲁棒和可泛化的乳腺X线摄影分类系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Result: 实验结果表明DECSC方法在去噪性能上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的DECSC框架成功统一了局部空谱相关性、非局部空间自相似性和全局空间一致性，为高光谱图像去噪提供了有效的深度平衡解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Ana C. Perre,Luís A. Alexandre,Luís C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用U-Net和CycleGAN模型从低能量图像生成虚拟双能量减影图像，评估其在乳腺病变分类中的效果，发现预训练U-Net表现最佳，F1分数达85.59%，虽略低于真实图像的90.35%，但显示出临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比增强光谱乳腺摄影(CESM)需要采集高能量图像，会增加患者辐射暴露。通过图像转换技术从低能量图像生成虚拟双能量减影图像，可减少辐射风险。

Method: 使用三种模型：预训练U-Net、端到端训练U-Net和CycleGAN模型，从低能量图像生成虚拟双能量减影图像，并评估这些虚拟图像在良恶性病变分类中的性能。

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，虚拟图像的F1分数为85.59%，真实图像为90.35%。虚拟图像虽略逊于真实图像，但仍显示出良好的分类性能。

Conclusion: 虚拟双能量减影图像生成具有重要临床价值，未来技术进步有望缩小与真实图像的差距，最终实现临床单独使用虚拟图像的可行性。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在医学影像标注中引入放射科医生置信度值的新方法，通过像素级置信度标注来捕捉标签不确定性，并在训练AI模型时利用这些置信度信息，显著提升了分割性能和下游临床任务的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中放射科医生之间的观察者差异导致标签不确定性，特别是在肺部超声等主观性较强的模态中。传统方法将标注视为绝对真实值，忽略了临床数据中固有的随机不确定性。

Method: 设计了一个数据标注协议，让放射科医生为每个标注区域提供像素级置信度值。在训练AI模型时，通过置信度阈值（如60%）对标签进行二值化处理，只使用高置信度的像素进行训练。

Result: 使用置信度阈值方法显著改善了分割性能，更重要的是提升了下游临床任务的性能：S/F氧合比估计、S/F比变化分类和30天患者再入院预测。60%置信度阈值的效果明显优于50%阈值。

Conclusion: 标签置信度是一个有价值的信号，当正确利用时可以显著增强AI在医学影像中的可靠性和临床实用性。训练时使用高置信度像素比使用所有标注像素更有效。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于GAN的超分辨率方法在4D Flow MRI中的应用，特别是针对近壁速度恢复问题。通过比较三种不同的对抗损失函数，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和性能方面表现最佳，显著改善了低信噪比条件下的近壁速度测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中受到空间分辨率低和噪声的限制，特别是在近壁速度测量方面。虽然机器学习超分辨率方法显示出潜力，但近壁速度恢复仍存在挑战。GAN在非医学超分辨率任务中表现出恢复清晰边界的强大能力，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管硅模型进行训练和验证，通过MR真实重建管道转换为合成图像。实现专用GAN架构，并评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein GAN。

Result: 提出的GAN相比非对抗参考方法改善了近壁速度恢复（vNRMSE：6.9% vs. 9.6%）。Wasserstein GAN表现出最佳稳定性和渐进改进（vNRMSE：6.9% vs. 7.2%），在低信噪比条件下显著优于仅生成器基线（vNRMSE：8.7% vs. 10.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了基于GAN的超分辨率在增强4D Flow MRI方面的潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域，同时强调了仔细选择对抗策略的必要性。Wasserstein GAN被证明是最稳定和有效的实现方式。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 提出动态不确定性感知MRI采集框架，通过概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，使用保形预测生成置信区间，实现基于个体需求的自动扫描终止，在保证精度的同时减少扫描时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI加速重建存在不确定性，固定加速因子导致扫描时间过长或质量不足，需要个性化采集方案来平衡扫描效率与诊断置信度

Method: 使用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过保形预测转换为校准的置信区间，迭代采样k空间并自动终止扫描

Result: 在膝关节和心脏MRI数据集上验证，相比固定协议减少扫描时间，同时为最终图像精度提供统计保证

Conclusion: 该框架超越固定加速因子，实现患者特异性采集，是迈向个性化和资源高效MRI的关键步骤

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息生成对抗网络的自学习方法，用于从单张X射线相衬全息图中同时恢复相位和吸收信息，无需训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位恢复方法依赖特定近似条件和边界条件，需要专家手动调参，且难以适应复杂多变的实验条件。深度学习方法的训练数据获取困难限制了其应用范围。

Method: 使用物理信息生成对抗网络，从单张全息图重建样本平面的未传播波场的相位和吸收信息，无需配对、非配对或模拟训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法显著拓宽了相位恢复技术的适用性，能够同时获取相位和吸收信息，解决了训练数据获取困难的问题，适用于各种复杂的实验配置。

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

Motivation: 为了解决多尺度代理建模中缺乏统一、可复现的工作流框架的问题，提供标准化的评估方法和工具，减少胶水代码并提高研究间的可比性。

Method: 使用分层轻量级流程（streams）在确定性层中调度，通过共享上下文进行读写操作，提供紧凑API和CLI支持单目标和多目标进化、PyTorch策略集成以及用户定义的评分和投票规则。

Conclusion: HEAS为跨学科、多层级研究提供了实用基础，能够产生可靠、可复现的结果，并通过两个紧凑示例（生态系统和企业决策场景）展示了其应用价值。

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible

Motivation: 人工智能预计将成为6G网络全生命周期的基础能力，需要构建能够理解语义信息并动态适应不同任务和环境的新型空口架构。

Method: 采用压缩技术从源数据中提取关键语义信息，关注任务相关性而非符号级精度；通过适应机制实现跨任务、数据类型和信道条件的动态语义信息传输。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个集成感知、通信和计算的空中联邦边缘学习系统，分析了无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对收敛性能的影响，并提出了一种低复杂度的ISCC算法来协调批量大小控制和资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着边缘计算和物联网的发展，需要在资源受限的边缘设备上实现高效的机器学习。传统的联邦学习面临通信瓶颈，而集成感知、通信和计算(ISCC)的空中联邦学习(Air-FEEL)系统能够同时处理感知数据采集和模型训练，但需要解决无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对收敛性能的影响。

Method: 采用空中计算(AirComp)技术实现单次模型聚合，分析ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL系统的收敛行为，特别考虑训练数据采集时的无线感知噪声和空中模型聚合时的失真。设计ISCC参数以最大化损失函数下降，同时满足每轮的延迟和能量预算。提出交替优化批量大小控制和网络资源分配的低复杂度算法。

Result: 理论分析表明感知、通信和计算竞争网络资源共同决定收敛速率。对于每个设备，如果获得更大的数据样本批量，则应消耗更少的感知功率，反之亦然。在给定批量大小下，设备的最优计算速度是满足延迟约束的最小速度。基于人体运动识别任务的数值结果验证了理论收敛分析。

Conclusion: 所提出的ISCC算法能够有效协调感知、通信和计算之间的批量大小控制和资源分配，提升学习性能。研究发现感知功率消耗与数据批量大小之间存在权衡关系，计算速度优化应基于延迟约束进行最小化设计。

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Method: 在𝔽₂域上进行穷举搜索分析20,160个满秩二进制矩阵，通过符号枚举验证ℤ域结果，使用现代机器学习技术分析矩阵结构

Result: 发现5,304个反例(26.3%)，矩阵密度预测准确率达95.7%，可分解矩阵位于约10维流形上，远低于预期的24维参数空间

Conclusion: Hadamard可分解性受到深层代数约束，表现为低维流形结构，矩阵密度是分解性的强预测指标

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

Motivation: 公平表示学习的核心目标是在保持预测准确性的同时减少对敏感属性的歧视。现有方法缺乏对这些公平目标之间权衡关系的统一理论分析框架。

Method: 提出基于核的EOₖ准则及其经验估计量ÊOₖ，该统计量可在二次时间内计算，并提供线性时间近似。推导了ÊOₖ的集中不等式，提供性能保证和误差界限。

Result: 在无偏和有偏条件下，EOₖ分别满足独立性和分离性，并在有偏条件下保持预测准确性同时下界独立性和校准性。提供了公平性合规的实践证明。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为未来实证研究中的原则性和可证明公平的算法设计奠定了重要基础，提供了统一的公平性分析工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

Motivation: 预期改善（EI）是贝叶斯优化中广泛使用的获取函数，但其累积悔憾上界理论一直缺失，需要理论分析来指导实践中incumbent的选择。

Method: 分析噪声高斯过程GP-EI算法，考察三种常用incumbent：BPMI、BSPMI和BOI，使用平方指数和Matérn核，提供累积悔憾上界理论分析。

Result: GP-EI在BPMI和BSPMI下都是无悔憾算法；在BOI下要么达到次线性悔憾上界，要么有快速收敛的噪声简单悔憾上界。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 研究为噪声设置下GP-EI的incumbent选择提供了理论指导，证明了算法的理论可靠性，对实践应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

TL;DR: 开发轻量级神经网络用于战场枪声检测系统，通过两层感知器和信号处理技术，在噪声环境中显著提高枪口冲击波检测率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 军事车辆移动环境中的噪声会降低枪声检测系统的性能，需要开发计算资源需求低的降噪算法以适应多种硬件平台

Method: 采用轻量级神经网络架构（两层隐藏层感知器）结合适当的信号处理技术，而非重型卷积神经网络

Result: 在噪声RMS值与枪口冲击波峰值幅度相当时，检测率提高了一倍以上

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络结合信号处理技术能有效提升移动军事环境中枪声检测系统的性能，且计算资源需求较低

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Motivation: 传统咳嗽声分析方法直接从原始频谱图分析往往难以发现显著的疾病特征差异，需要更可解释的技术来挖掘疾病特异性声学特征

Method: 使用卷积神经网络处理咳嗽声频谱图，生成遮挡图来突出相关频谱区域，然后对加权后的频谱图进行频谱分析，提取多个频谱特征

Result: 在COPD患者中发现咳嗽模式在识别出的感兴趣频谱区域中表现出更大的变异性，而原始频谱图分析未能显示显著差异

Conclusion: XAI技术能够揭示疾病特异性声学特征，通过提供更可解释的结果显著提升咳嗽声分析的诊断能力

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Result: 在DCASE 2024挑战赛数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提高了ASD性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提取机器声音特征，减少冗余信息干扰，为异常声音检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset
demonstrate significant improvements in ASD performance with our proposed
methods.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于语言模型的TTS系统经常产生与输入文本不符的幻觉语音，现有方法要么需要过多训练资源，要么引入显著推理延迟。

Method: 首先进行不确定性分析，发现幻觉与模型不确定性正相关；将TTS生成重新表述为轨迹流优化问题，引入改进的子轨迹平衡目标和锐化内部奖励作为目标分布；集成奖励温度衰减和学习率优化。

Result: 在挑战性测试案例上减少超过50%的字符错误率，不确定性降低高达58%。

Conclusion: GOAT展示了强大的泛化能力和有效性，能够有效缓解TTS系统中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: GenSIM是首个基于生成式AI的全北极海冰模型，能够在12小时窗口内准确预测海冰浓度、厚度和漂移等关键属性，相比确定性预测具有更高精度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海冰模型计算成本高昂，限制了在集合预报和气候模拟中的应用。海冰过程复杂、尺度不变且各向异性，难以在地球系统模型中准确表示。

Method: 基于生成式AI技术，使用最先进的海冰-海洋系统长期模拟数据进行训练，仅需大气强迫作为输入，就能预测海冰演变。

Result: GenSIM能够稳健地再现数值模型和观测中的统计数据，既表现出脆性短期动力学特征，又描绘了长期海冰减少趋势。模型似乎学习了一个内部海洋模拟器，具备外推能力。

Conclusion: 生成式模型具有从短期预测推断缓慢演变气候相关动力学的巨大潜力，能够泛化到未见过的气候情景并编码隐藏物理过程。

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

TL;DR: AI天气模型在常规天气预报中表现出色，但在预测破纪录极端天气事件时，仍落后于传统数值模型HRES，存在系统性低估热记录和高估冷记录的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI模型在天气预报基准任务上超越了传统数值模型，但其在预测前所未有的极端天气事件（特别是破纪录事件）方面的外推能力和可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 通过比较AI模型（GraphCast、Pangu-Weather、Fuxi）与欧洲中期天气预报中心的HRES数值模型在破纪录热、冷、风事件上的预报误差，分析AI模型对极端事件的预测性能。

Result: AI模型在破纪录极端事件的预报误差普遍大于HRES，倾向于低估破纪录事件的频率和强度，对热记录预测不足而对冷记录预测过度，且误差随记录超出程度增加而增大。

Conclusion: 当前AI天气模型在超出训练域范围的外推能力和预测最具影响力的破纪录天气事件方面存在局限，需要进一步严格验证和模型开发才能用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

Motivation: 探索人类大脑能够进行符号推理而大多数其他动物不能的原因，研究动态绑定之外的符号思维必要机制

Method: 通过17个通用模拟实验，比较具有和不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在各种任务中的表现

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于理解人类大脑如何产生符号思维，揭示了生物智能与机器学习方法的差异，并对生物启发人工智能具有重要意义

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络在CERN HL-LHC的喷注标记任务中表现出色，但其计算复杂度和不规则内存访问模式难以满足FPGA硬件触发系统的严格延迟和资源约束要求。

Method: 提出JEDI-linear架构，通过共享变换和全局聚合消除显式成对交互；采用细粒度量化感知训练和逐参数位宽优化；使用基于分布式算术的无乘法器乘累加操作。

Result: FPGA实现显示：延迟降低3.7-11.5倍，启动间隔降低高达150倍，LUT使用降低高达6.2倍，同时提供更高模型精度，完全无需DSP模块（对比方案需要8700+个DSP），首次实现低于60ns延迟。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了下一代触发系统的发展，实现了在实时环境中准确、可扩展且资源高效的GNN推理，开源模板将支持科学应用的复现和广泛采用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 本文针对多维度断点回归设计(MRD)中的模糊性问题，提出了理论框架来识别和减少非合规行为，改进了生产系统中的因果效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际生产系统中经常涉及多个阈值和标准的决策，传统MRD方法将其转换为一维设计会引入非合规行为，需要开发理论工具来解决这种模糊性问题。

Method: 开发了多维断点规则下单位行为类型的分类系统，建立了合规者断点效应存在和识别的条件，研究了规则分解对单位行为的影响，并通过模拟和半导体制造实际数据进行验证。

Result: 框架能够识别和移除非合规单位，降低估计方差，在光电半导体制造的实际应用中证明了其实用性，能够改进生产策略。

Conclusion: 提出的MRD框架在多维断点设计中有效解决了模糊性问题，提高了因果效应估计的准确性，在生产制造领域具有重要实践价值。

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification

Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，通过利用空闲状态的可检测性来指导探索，在关键运动点施加扰动能够带来更好的迭代策略改进效果

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种针对文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过改变推理过程避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂干预或显著计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，而DeCoDi旨在仅改变推理过程，使其对更广泛的从业者更加易用

Method: 改变扩散过程以避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，该方法不改变图像质量，计算开销可忽略，可应用于任何基于扩散的图像生成模型

Result: 通过对护士、消防员和CEO等概念进行性别、种族和年龄去偏，人工评估1200张生成图像显示方法有效。GPT4o自动评估与人工评估无显著统计差异

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法有潜力显著改善基于扩散的文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，评估结果显示评估者间一致性可靠，保护属性覆盖更全面

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

TL;DR: AmbiSQL是一个交互式文本到SQL系统，通过自动检测查询歧义并通过多项选择题引导用户澄清意图，显著提高了SQL生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本到SQL任务中容易出错，查询歧义是主要障碍，导致用户意图误解和SQL生成不准确。

Method: 引入细粒度歧义分类法识别影响数据库元素映射和LLM推理的歧义，通过用户反馈重写模糊问题，集成多项选择题交互界面。

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上达到87.2%的歧义检测精度，集成文本到SQL系统后SQL精确匹配准确率提升50%。

Conclusion: AmbiSQL通过交互式歧义澄清显著提升了文本到SQL系统的性能和实用性，证明了用户反馈在解决查询歧义中的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Huixin Zhong,Yanan Liu,Qi Cao,Shijin Wang,Zijing Ye,Zimu Wang,Shiyao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究通过信息级联范式分析大语言模型的社会从众行为，发现其从众主要由信息性影响驱动，但不确定性会显著调节这种行为模式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在协作团队中的集成，其社会从众性（倾向于与多数意见保持一致）已成为关键问题。需要了解这种从众行为是源于信息性影响（理性使用群体线索）还是规范性影响（社会压力），以及不确定性如何调节这种平衡

Method: 采用行为经济学中的信息级联范式，在三种决策场景（医疗、法律、投资）中评估九个领先的大语言模型，通过操纵信息不确定性（q = 0.667, 0.55, 0.70）来量化分析两种驱动因素

Result: 结果表明信息性影响是模型行为的基础机制，准确性和置信度随证据强度一致上升。但在低到中等不确定性场景中，表现为保守策略，系统性地低估所有证据来源；高不确定性则触发关键转变，模型在保持信息处理的同时表现出类似规范性的放大效应，过度重视公共信号

Conclusion: 大语言模型的从众行为主要由信息性影响驱动，但不确定性会显著调节这种行为模式，在高不确定性条件下会出现类似人类规范性影响的特征

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Motivation: 人工智能在专业实践中趋势增强，需要在高等教育中插入AI相关能力，但跨学科课程开发研究仍有限

Method: 采用混合方法，结合定量课程映射和定性焦点小组访谈，从学术和业界双角度评估课程质量、一致性、实用性和效果

Result: 获得了跨学科AI课程开发实践理解，揭示了教育者参与式开发对质量认知的影响

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

TL;DR: 通过结合视神经头结构特征和视野功能参数，使用机器学习模型成功分类丽角关闭性青光眼患者的进展速度，随机森林模型达到最佳效果（AUC=0.87）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 丽角关闭性青光眼（PACG）的进展速度异质性很大，需要准确分类慢速和快速进展者以优化治疗策略。传统方法单独使用结构或功能参数效果有限，因此需要结合两者的集成方法来提高分类准确性。

Method: 纳入299名患者451只眼睛，基于>5年内>5次可靠视野检查。快速进展定义为VFI年递减<-2.0%。使用AI分割OCT数据提取31个视神经头结构参数，结合区域化视野敏感度数据，训练多种机器学习分类器，使用SHAP方法识别关键预测因子。

Result: 随机森林模型结合结构和功能特征达到最佳效果（AUC=0.87），显著超过仅使用结构（AUC=0.82）或仅使用功能（AUC=0.78）的模型。SHAP分析识别出6个关键预测因子：下方MRW、下方和下时位RNFL厚度、鼻额位碳板曲率、上鼻位视野敏感度、以及下方RNFL和GCL+IPL厚度。

Conclusion: 结合视神经头结构特征和视野功能参数显著提高了PACG进展风险分类的准确性。下方视神经头特征（MRW和RNFL厚度）是最具预测价值的因子，也强调了视神经头形态学在监测疾病进展中的关键作用。

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了对抗性随机森林(ARF)在流行病学合成数据生成中的效果，通过复现6项流行病学研究，证明合成数据能可靠重现原始研究的关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据生成方法存在质量有限、计算需求高、非专家使用复杂等问题，且评估策略往往不能直接反映统计效用，需要验证合成数据是否能可靠复现流行病学研究结果。

Method: 使用对抗性随机森林(ARF)生成合成表格数据，复现6项流行病学研究的统计分析，比较原始结果与合成结果，并评估维度和变量复杂度对合成质量的影响。

Result: 所有复现研究中，多次合成数据复制的结果与原始发现一致。即使在样本量-维度比较低的数据集上，各种描述性和推断性分析的结果也与原始结果高度匹配。降低维度和预推导变量进一步提高了结果的质量和稳定性。

Conclusion: ARF是一种高效便捷的流行病学合成数据生成方法，能够可靠复现关键研究结果，降维和变量预处理可进一步提升合成质量。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: Equi-mRNA是首个基于等变对称性的mRNA语言模型，通过编码同义密码子的循环对称性，在表达预测和序列生成任务中显著优于传统基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA治疗和合成生物学的发展需要能够捕捉同义密码子使用潜在结构的模型，现有方法未能充分建模遗传密码固有的对称性关系。

Method: 引入等变mRNA语言模型，将同义密码子对称性编码为SO(2)循环子群，结合群论先验、等变损失和对称感知池化。

Result: 在下游属性预测任务中准确率提升约10%，序列生成中真实性提高4倍，功能属性保持能力提升28%，并成功重现已知的GC含量偏倚和tRNA丰度模式。

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA建立了基于生物学原理的mRNA建模新范式，对下一代治疗药物设计具有重要意义。

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

TL;DR: 提出基于U统计量的随机森林方法Forest U-Test，用于检测基因-基因和基因-环境交互作用，在复杂性状遗传关联研究中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测基因-基因和基因-环境交互作用面临巨大挑战，传统方法受限于高维特征空间和计算强度，只能检测两两交互作用。

Method: 采用基于U统计量的随机森林方法（Forest U-Test），通过递归分割处理高维遗传关联研究。

Result: 模拟研究表明Forest U-Test优于现有方法。在大麻依赖研究中检测到显著联合关联（p<0.001），并在两个独立数据集中得到复制（p=5.93e-19和4.70e-17）。

Conclusion: Forest U-Test是检测复杂性状遗传关联中交互作用的有效方法，具有优越性能和可复制性。

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,

Motivation: 当前基因数据和表型数据往往是分离的，缺乏整合的多模态数据集，这限制了机器学习模型学习基因与表型之间关联的能力，阻碍了对基因-表型关系的准确理解。

Method: 构建了AGP数据集，整合了基因表达谱和异质表型数据，并建立了基准测试，包括传统回归方法和基于生物信息超图的解释性基线模型来验证基因-性状关联。

Result: 创建了首个为相同拟南芥样本提供多模态基因信息和异质表型数据的数据集，支持表型预测和可解释图学习任务。

Conclusion: AGP数据集将促进研究社区利用基因信息、高阶基因配对和多源性状数据来准确理解基因型与表型之间的联系。

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

TL;DR: GenTune是一个帮助设计师理解AI生成提示词与图像内容映射关系的系统，通过可视化选择图像元素并追踪对应提示词标签，实现精确且全局一致的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在使用生成式AI时面临两个主要挑战：难以理解冗长提示词中影响特定视觉元素的关键词，以及局部编辑时难以保持全局一致性。

Method: 开发GenTune系统，允许设计师选择生成图像中的任何元素，追踪到对应的提示词标签，并通过修改这些标签来指导精确且全局一致的图像优化。

Result: 在20名设计师的总结性研究中，GenTune显著提高了提示词-图像理解、优化质量和效率，以及整体满意度（所有p<0.01）。实地研究进一步验证了其在实际工作环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: GenTune通过澄清AI生成提示词与图像内容的映射关系，有效增强了人机协作，解决了设计师在使用生成式AI时遇到的关键挑战。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

### [295] [Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Hazardous Near-Earth Object Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Resampling Strategies and Machine Learning Algorithms in Planetary Risk Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15106)
*Sunkalp Chandra*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多种机器学习模型在预测危险近地天体方面的性能，发现随机森林和梯度提升分类器表现最佳，F2分数分别达到0.987和0.986，准确率超过99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估不同机器学习模型在预测危险近地天体方面的性能，为选择最适合此类任务的分类器提供依据。

Method: 采用二元分类框架，包括数据缩放、幂变换和交叉验证，比较了六种分类器：随机森林、梯度提升、支持向量机、线性判别分析、逻辑回归和K近邻算法。

Result: 随机森林和梯度提升分类器表现最优，F2分数分别为0.987和0.986，准确率达到99.7%和99.6%；支持向量机次之(0.896)；线性判别分析和逻辑回归中等(约0.749)；K近邻最差(0.691)。

Conclusion: 集成学习方法在危险近地天体预测中表现出色，模型选择应考虑数据集特性和评估指标。未来研究可关注超参数优化和特征工程以进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文主张AI测试评估需要考虑AI系统的战略推理能力，并建议使用博弈论方法来设计更有效的安全评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI评估方法可能无法充分捕捉AI系统在部署时的战略行为，因为AI系统可能会理解评估环境并进行策略性应对，从而在评估中表现良好但在实际部署中出现问题。

Method: 通过分析现有AI系统的案例、回顾相关研究，以及对一个风格化评估场景进行形式化战略分析，来验证提出的观点。

Result: 研究表明AI系统确实可能表现出战略推理行为，传统的评估方法存在局限性，需要开发能够检测和应对这种战略行为的新评估框架。

Conclusion: AI测试评估必须考虑系统的战略推理能力，博弈论分析可以为设计更稳健的评估方法提供理论框架，这代表了AI安全研究的重要发展方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

*Ethan Lake,Ehsan Pajouheshgar*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 研究发现二维多体记忆系统比之前认为的更加丰富多样，除了已知的Toom规则外，还存在多种具有不同纠错机制和噪声依赖性的记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多体记忆系统的多样性，了解局部非平衡动力学如何在存在扰动的情况下长时间保持初始条件信息。

Method: 结合严格数学证明和机器学习方法，研究二维系统中的记忆动力学。

Result: 发现了多种与Toom规则不同的记忆系统，包括具有独特纠错方式、由涨落稳定的有序相以及仅在噪声存在时保存信息的系统。

Conclusion: 物理系统可以通过多种不同方式实现鲁棒的信息存储，多体记忆物理比之前认识到的更加丰富。

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

TL;DR: 提出基于Flow Matching的机器学习框架，克服MCMC方法的扩展限制，实现"小训练、大生成"能力，在2D XY模型中验证了系统大小和温度范围的双重泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在处理大系统时面临计算复杂度高的问题，需要开发能够高效生成大系统样本的新方法。

Method: 使用Flow Matching框架学习温度条件映射，结合CNN架构的归纳偏置确保学习到的局部物理规则具有尺度不变性。

Result: 在32×32晶格上训练的网络能够可靠生成128×128大系统的样本，准确捕获BKT相变特征，与热力学可观测量高度一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效研究临界现象建立了新范式，具有显著计算优势，可直接应用于其他经典或量子多体系统。

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

TL;DR: DeepNaniNet是一个基于深度神经网络的推荐框架，通过图架构和BERT文本嵌入解决冷启动和数据稀疏问题，在动漫推荐数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小众动态社区的推荐系统面临数据稀疏、冷启动用户/物品和隐私约束等挑战，传统协同过滤和基于内容的方法在这些场景下表现不佳

Method: 采用归纳式图架构，结合用户-物品交互、物品-物品关系和BERT生成的丰富文本评论嵌入，使用新颖的"内容篮子"用户表示和基于自动编码器的泛化策略处理未见用户

Result: 在CiteULike基准测试中获得最先进的冷启动结果，在AnimeULike数据集上比WMF和DropoutNet在Recall@100指标上分别提升7倍和1.5倍

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet能够在数据稀疏、冷启动严重的环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算在机器学习和推荐系统领域展现出巨大潜力，但现有量子推荐系统在处理现实数据集和噪声环境方面存在挑战。本研究旨在开发一种能够有效处理真实世界数据并在噪声条件下保持性能的混合量子-经典推荐框架。

Method: 使用K-Means算法将用户聚类为多个独特群体，通过编码器激活函数转换为极性模式。将这些模式集成到基于变分量子Hopfield联想记忆（QHAM）的混合推荐模型中。在理想和噪声环境下分别训练35个epoch，采用MSE损失函数。通过优化QHAM架构，仅随机更新一个目标量子比特来减少量子比特开销。

Result: 在理想环境下：ROC值0.9795，准确率0.8841，F-1分数0.8786。在噪声环境下（使用Qiskit AER噪声模型，包含比特翻转和读出错误）：ROC值0.9177，准确率0.8013，F-1分数0.7866。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个结合变分量子计算与深度学习的新颖框架，能够处理现实世界数据集，性能与纯经典方法相当。模型在噪声配置下表现相似，展示了稳定的性能，为推荐系统的未来应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP是一种新型黑盒攻击框架，利用大语言模型的上下文学习能力生成高排名对抗文档，无需梯度访问或模型内部操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经排序模型虽然高效但易受对抗性攻击，现有方法依赖token级扰动或手动重写，需要更有效且隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 通过少样本提示生成对抗文档，使用FSAP-IntraQ（同查询有害示例）和FSAP-InterQ（跨查询模式迁移）两种模式。

Result: 在TREC 2020-2021健康错误信息数据集上，FSAP生成的文档持续超越真实准确文档的排名，且难以检测。

Conclusion: FSAP构成了对神经检索系统的现实且可扩展的威胁，能有效泛化到专有和开源大语言模型。

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统在实践中往往表现不如传统的ID基模型，主要存在两个关键限制：项目标记化中缺乏协作信号，以及编码器-解码器架构的效率低下。

Method: 1. COSETTE：对比标记化方法，将协作信息直接整合到学习到的项目表示中，联合优化内容重建和推荐相关性
2. MARIUS：轻量级音频启发生成模型，将时间线建模与项目解码解耦

Result: 在标准序列推荐基准测试中，该方法缩小甚至消除了生成式模型与现代ID基模型之间的性能差距，同时保持了生成范式的优势

Conclusion: 通过引入协作感知的标记化和高效的生成架构，成功解决了生成式推荐系统的关键限制，为实现实用化的生成式推荐提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖数值评分或完整排名列表，但评分存在行为偏差和主观解释问题，而获取完整排名不切实际，需要更准确高效的用户偏好学习方法

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce概率框架的成对比较偏好模型，提出效用驱动的主动采样策略，选择能最大程度改善最终推荐结果效用的查询，支持矩阵分解和神经网络等多种模型

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在电影推荐和大学招生两个不同场景中都提供了更准确、数据效率更高、以用户为中心的个性化排名范式

Conclusion: 该效用驱动的成对比较框架为推荐系统提供了灵活且有效的解决方案，能够显式对齐系统目标与具体应用场景的高质量结果定义

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Motivation: 基于图的ANNS已成为现代AI应用的主流方法，但现有研究主要关注算法创新，忽视了内存布局对执行时间的显著影响。

Method: 构建统一的评估框架，包括图适配器（将任意图拓扑转换为通用表示）和GPU优化的图遍历引擎，全面评估不同重排序策略。

Result: 在保持搜索精度的前提下，GPU目标重排序实现了高达15%的QPS提升，证明内存布局优化与现有算法创新正交。

Conclusion: 内存布局优化是图基ANNS性能提升的重要方向，提出的框架为后续研究提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度动机信号提取有效解决了推荐系统中的冷启动和稀疏数据问题，为个性化推荐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ItemID的推荐系统在大规模动态物品库和稀疏长尾数据上存在可扩展性和泛化性限制，需要语义ID来改善新物品和稀有物品的推荐效果

Method: 两阶段框架：1)共享-特定分词器使用多专家架构和正交正则化捕获多模态信息；2)行为感知微调通过多模态重建损失动态适应下游推荐目标

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试表明MMQ有效统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应，为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了可扩展解决方案

Conclusion: MMQ框架成功解决了语义ID生成中的关键挑战，为推荐系统提供了更有效的多模态表示学习方法

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MoEcho发现混合专家(MoE)架构存在侧信道安全漏洞，攻击者可通过硬件执行痕迹推断用户敏感数据，提出了四种新型侧信道攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE架构在Transformer模型中的广泛应用，其自适应路由机制虽然提升了效率，但无意中创建了新的隐私攻击面，硬件执行痕迹可能泄露用户敏感信息。

Method: 提出了四种新型架构侧信道：CPU上的缓存占用通道和页面换出重加载，GPU上的性能计数器和TLB驱逐重加载，并基于这些漏洞设计了四种隐私攻击方法。

Result: 成功在基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型上实现了提示推断攻击、响应重构攻击、视觉推断攻击和视觉重构攻击，有效破坏了用户隐私。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对现代Transformer中流行的MoE结构的运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私威胁，呼吁在使用MoE模型开发高效大规模AI服务时采取及时有效的防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种防御间接提示注入攻击的新方法，通过工具依赖图(TDG)将动作规划与外部数据交互解耦，显著减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在与不可信数据源交互时容易受到间接提示注入(IPI)攻击，现有防御方法依赖模型内在安全性假设，缺乏结构性约束，仍存在漏洞。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将代理任务执行过程建模为在工具依赖图(TDG)上的遍历，明确分离动作规划和外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间取得了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard通过结构性约束显著增强了代理系统对IPI攻击的鲁棒性，为动态环境中更安全的智能代理系统开发铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MCPTox是首个系统评估LLM代理对工具投毒攻击鲁棒性的基准测试，在真实MCP环境中发现主流代理普遍存在漏洞，攻击成功率高达72.8%，现有安全对齐机制对此类攻击无效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM代理提供标准化外部工具接口，但引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注通过工具输出注入攻击，而工具投毒攻击（在工具元数据中嵌入恶意指令）缺乏系统化评估

Method: 基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具构建MCPTox基准，设计3种攻击模板通过少样本学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10类潜在风险，在20个主流LLM代理上进行评估

Result: 发现代理普遍易受工具投毒攻击，o1-mini攻击成功率72.8%；能力更强的模型更易受攻击；现有安全对齐几乎无效，最高拒绝率(Claude-3.7-Sonnet)不到3%

Conclusion: 工具投毒是广泛存在的威胁，现有安全机制无法有效防御利用合法工具进行未授权操作的恶意行为，MCPTox为理解和缓解此威胁提供了重要实证基准

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: NetSight是一个用于网络数据异常检测的监督学习框架，能够在线持续检测和适应分布偏移，无需人工标注，通过伪标签技术和知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘，在三个长期网络数据集上比依赖人工标注的先进方法F1分数提升达11.72%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布偏移对深度学习异常检测系统构成重大挑战。现有系统难以适应这种变化：监督学习方法需要昂贵的人工标注，无监督方法需要难以获取的干净数据来进行偏移适应。这两种要求在现实中都难以满足。

Method: NetSight框架采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，并使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布偏移。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法表现出更优的适应性能，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了其在经历随时间分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性，能够有效解决分布偏移带来的挑战。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BadFU攻击，首次展示了在联邦学习中通过合法遗忘请求注入后门的攻击方式，揭示了联邦遗忘机制的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据隐私和监管合规要求的增长，联邦学习中的机器遗忘技术变得越来越重要，但将遗忘整合到联邦学习中带来了新的安全风险，特别是攻击者可能利用遗忘过程破坏全局模型的完整性。

Method: 提出BadFU攻击策略，恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，当请求遗忘伪装样本时，全局模型会转变为后门状态。

Result: 在各种联邦学习框架和遗忘策略下的广泛实验验证了BadFU的有效性，攻击成功率高达90%以上，揭示了当前联邦遗忘实践中的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦遗忘机制中存在的严重安全风险，强调了开发更安全、更鲁棒的联邦遗忘机制的迫切需求。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

### [315] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个语义归一化框架，用于处理视觉叙事图谱中的不一致性和冗余问题，通过词汇相似性和嵌入聚类来统一语义相关的动作和事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事（如漫画）需要结构化表示来捕捉事件、角色及其关系，但符号化叙事图谱常存在不一致性和冗余，限制了推理和泛化的效果。

Method: 基于认知叙事理解模型，采用词汇相似性和嵌入聚类方法来整合语义相关的动作和事件，减少标注噪声并保持可解释性。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上的实验表明，语义归一化在动作检索、角色定位和事件摘要等叙事推理任务中提高了连贯性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 语义归一化是构建可扩展、认知启发的多模态叙事理解图谱模型的关键步骤。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a
