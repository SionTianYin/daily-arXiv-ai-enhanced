### [1] [Mind the Language Gap: Automated and Augmented Evaluation of Bias in LLMs for High- and Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18560)
*Alessio Buscemi,Cédric Lothritz,Sergio Morales,Marcos Gomez-Vazquez,Robert Clarisó,Jordi Cabot,German Castignani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLA-BiTe框架通过多语言增强偏见测试，改进现有方法，支持跨语言偏见评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在训练数据中存在的社会偏见问题。

Method: 利用自动翻译和改写技术，在六种语言（含两种低资源语言）中测试四种先进LLMs。

Result: MLA-BiTe能全面评估LLMs在七种敏感歧视类别中的表现。

Conclusion: MLA-BiTe为多语言偏见测试提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive natural language
processing capabilities but often perpetuate social biases inherent in their
training data. To address this, we introduce MultiLingual Augmented Bias
Testing (MLA-BiTe), a framework that improves prior bias evaluation methods by
enabling systematic multilingual bias testing. MLA-BiTe leverages automated
translation and paraphrasing techniques to support comprehensive assessments
across diverse linguistic settings. In this study, we evaluate the
effectiveness of MLA-BiTe by testing four state-of-the-art LLMs in six
languages -- including two low-resource languages -- focusing on seven
sensitive categories of discrimination.

### [2] [Span-Level Hallucination Detection for LLM-Generated Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18639)
*Passant Elchafei,Mervet Abu-Elkheir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于语义角色标注（SRL）的跨度级幻觉检测框架，用于检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉部分，并在SemEval-2025共享任务中展示了竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测LLM生成答案中的幻觉跨度对提高事实一致性至关重要。

Method: 通过SRL将答案分解为原子角色，并与基于问题提示的参考上下文进行比较，使用DeBERTa模型评估语义对齐，并结合置信度得分检测幻觉。

Result: 在Mu-SHROOM数据集上表现优异，并通过GPT-4和LLaMA验证了幻觉跨度的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效改进了LLM生成答案中的幻觉检测。

Abstract: Detecting spans of hallucination in LLM-generated answers is crucial for
improving factual consistency. This paper presents a span-level hallucination
detection framework for the SemEval-2025 Shared Task, focusing on English and
Arabic texts. Our approach integrates Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to decompose
the answer into atomic roles, which are then compared with a retrieved
reference context obtained via question-based LLM prompting. Using a
DeBERTa-based textual entailment model, we evaluate each role semantic
alignment with the retrieved context. The entailment scores are further refined
through token-level confidence measures derived from output logits, and the
combined scores are used to detect hallucinated spans. Experiments on the
Mu-SHROOM dataset demonstrate competitive performance. Additionally,
hallucinated spans have been verified through fact-checking by prompting GPT-4
and LLaMA. Our findings contribute to improving hallucination detection in
LLM-generated responses.

### [3] [Can Third-parties Read Our Emotions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18673)
*Jiayi Li,Yingfan Zhou,Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Halima Binte Islam,Sneha Arya,Shomir Wilson,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨第三方标注在捕捉作者私人状态（如情感）时的局限性，发现LLMs优于人类标注者，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证第三方标注是否能准确反映作者的私人状态（如情感），并探索改进标注质量的方法。

Method: 通过实验比较第三方标注（人类和LLMs）与作者自标注的情感标签，并研究人口统计学相似性对标注质量的影响。

Result: 第三方标注（尤其是人类）在反映作者私人状态时存在显著局限性，但LLMs表现更好。人口统计学相似性可提升人类标注质量，而加入作者信息对LLMs有轻微改进。

Conclusion: 需改进第三方标注实践以更准确建模作者私人状态，并提出评估框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing tasks that aim to infer an author's private
states, e.g., emotions and opinions, from their written text, typically rely on
datasets annotated by third-party annotators. However, the assumption that
third-party annotators can accurately capture authors' private states remains
largely unexamined. In this study, we present human subjects experiments on
emotion recognition tasks that directly compare third-party annotations with
first-party (author-provided) emotion labels. Our findings reveal significant
limitations in third-party annotations-whether provided by human annotators or
large language models (LLMs)-in faithfully representing authors' private
states. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We
further explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that
demographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human
annotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party
demographic information into prompts leads to a marginal but statistically
significant improvement in LLMs' performance. We introduce a framework for
evaluating the limitations of third-party annotations and call for refined
annotation practices to accurately represent and model authors' private states.

### [4] [Spatial Speech Translation: Translating Across Space With Binaural Hearables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18715)
*Tuochao Chen,Qirui Wang,Runlin He,Shyam Gollakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的听觉设备技术，能够在嘈杂环境中实时翻译多语言对话，同时保留说话者的空间位置和声音特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语音翻译技术在干扰环境下失效的问题，并首次将空间感知融入语音翻译。

Method: 结合盲源分离、定位、实时表达性翻译和双耳渲染技术，实现实时推理。

Result: 在干扰环境下，翻译BLEU分数达22.01，用户研究验证了系统在真实环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该技术为语音翻译领域首次引入空间感知，展现了在复杂环境中的潜力。

Abstract: Imagine being in a crowded space where people speak a different language and
having hearables that transform the auditory space into your native language,
while preserving the spatial cues for all speakers. We introduce spatial speech
translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the
wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice
characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we
tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation,
localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to
preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving
real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation
with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which
fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01
when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other
speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's
effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen
real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the
first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.

### [5] [Building UD Cairo for Old English in the Classroom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18718)
*Lauren Levine,Junghyun Min,Amir Zeldes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了基于UD Cairo句子的古英语样本树库，通过LLM提示和真实古英语数据搜索收集数据，并由初学者标注后比较和调整。结果显示LLM输出需后编辑，初学者标注虽不完美但集体效果良好。初步解析实验表明，现代英语训练数据对古英语解析效果不佳，但标注特征可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为历史语言学课程提供古英语样本树库，探索LLM和初学者标注在古英语数据处理中的效果。

Method: 结合LLM提示和真实数据搜索收集20个句子，由初学者标注后比较和调整，并进行初步解析实验。

Result: LLM输出需后编辑，初学者集体标注效果良好；现代英语训练数据对古英语解析效果差，但标注特征可改善性能。

Conclusion: LLM和初学者标注可用于古英语数据处理，标注特征对解析性能有积极影响。

Abstract: In this paper we present a sample treebank for Old English based on the UD
Cairo sentences, collected and annotated as part of a classroom curriculum in
Historical Linguistics. To collect the data, a sample of 20 sentences
illustrating a range of syntactic constructions in the world's languages, we
employ a combination of LLM prompting and searches in authentic Old English
data. For annotation we assigned sentences to multiple students with limited
prior exposure to UD, whose annotations we compare and adjudicate. Our results
suggest that while current LLM outputs in Old English do not reflect authentic
syntax, this can be mitigated by post-editing, and that although beginner
annotators do not possess enough background to complete the task perfectly,
taken together they can produce good results and learn from the experience. We
also conduct preliminary parsing experiments using Modern English training
data, and find that although performance on Old English is poor, parsing on
annotated features (lemma, hyperlemma, gloss) leads to improved performance.

### [6] [EvidenceBench: A Benchmark for Extracting Evidence from Biomedical Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18736)
*Jianyou Wang,Weili Cao,Kaicheng Wang,Xiaoyue Wang,Ashish Dalvi,Gino Prasad,Qishan Liang,Hsuan-lin Her,Ming Wang,Qin Yang,Gene W. Yeo,David E. Neal,Maxim Khan,Christopher D. Rosin,Ramamohan Paturi,Leon Bergen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化方法EvidenceBench，用于在生物医学论文中查找与假设相关的证据，并通过专家标注验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者在验证科学假设时需要查找相关证据，但目前缺乏高效的工具。

Method: 通过假设生成和逐句标注的流程创建EvidenceBench，并验证其准确性。

Result: 现有语言模型和检索系统在任务中表现显著低于专家水平。

Conclusion: EvidenceBench及其扩展版EvidenceBench-100k为模型训练提供了大规模标注数据。

Abstract: We study the task of automatically finding evidence relevant to hypotheses in
biomedical papers. Finding relevant evidence is an important step when
researchers investigate scientific hypotheses. We introduce EvidenceBench to
measure models performance on this task, which is created by a novel pipeline
that consists of hypothesis generation and sentence-by-sentence annotation of
biomedical papers for relevant evidence, completely guided by and faithfully
following existing human experts judgment. We demonstrate the pipeline's
validity and accuracy with multiple sets of human-expert annotations. We
evaluated a diverse set of language models and retrieval systems on the
benchmark and found that model performances still fall significantly short of
the expert level on this task. To show the scalability of our proposed
pipeline, we create a larger EvidenceBench-100k with 107,461 fully annotated
papers with hypotheses to facilitate model training and development. Both
datasets are available at https://github.com/EvidenceBench/EvidenceBench

*Ojasw Upadhyay,Abishek Saravankumar,Ayman Ismail*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynLexLM是一种通过课程学习和合成数据增强高效预训练法律LLM的新方法，旨在提升法律领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练难以捕捉法律细节，且法律数据稀缺，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用课程学习（从简单到复杂的法律文本）和合成数据增强（如Gemini Pro生成QA对）。

Result: 在BigLaw-Bench和EUR-Lex-Sum等法律基准测试中表现优于传统模型。

Conclusion: SynLexLM有望提升法律文档分析和研究工具，推动法律AI的普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often require extensive
fine-tuning and large datasets for specialized domains like law.
General-purpose pre-training may not capture legal nuances, and acquiring
sufficient legal data is challenging. We introduce SynLexLM, a novel approach
to efficiently pre-train a legal LLM. Our method employs curriculum learning,
progressing from simple to complex legal texts and queries, combined with
synthetic data augmentation using models like Gemini Pro to address data
scarcity. We aim to achieve improved performance on legal benchmarks
(BigLaw-Bench, EUR-Lex-Sum) compared to traditional models and fine-tuned
versions. Preliminary work involves generating synthetic QA pairs reflecting
legal reasoning. This work aims to enhance legal document analysis and research
tools, potentially democratizing access to advanced legal AI.

### [8] [Stealing Creator's Workflow: A Creator-Inspired Agentic Framework with Iterative Feedback Loop for Improved Scientific Short-form Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18805)
*Jong Inn Park,Maanas Taneja,Qianwen Wang,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SciTalk是一个多LLM代理框架，用于从科学论文生成准确且吸引人的短视频，通过迭代反馈机制提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端方法在科学传播中因内容复杂性和专家与读者差距导致的事实不准确和视觉伪影问题。

Method: 提出SciTalk框架，利用文本、图表、视觉风格和头像等多种来源，通过内容总结、视觉场景规划、文本和布局编辑的专门代理，并结合迭代反馈机制优化生成。

Result: 实验表明，SciTalk在生成科学准确且吸引人的内容上优于简单提示方法，但尚未达到人类创作者的质量。

Conclusion: SciTalk为反馈驱动的视频生成提供了有价值的见解，代码、数据和生成视频将公开。

Abstract: Generating engaging, accurate short-form videos from scientific papers is
challenging due to content complexity and the gap between expert authors and
readers. Existing end-to-end methods often suffer from factual inaccuracies and
visual artifacts, limiting their utility for scientific dissemination. To
address these issues, we propose SciTalk, a novel multi-LLM agentic framework,
grounding videos in various sources, such as text, figures, visual styles, and
avatars. Inspired by content creators' workflows, SciTalk uses specialized
agents for content summarization, visual scene planning, and text and layout
editing, and incorporates an iterative feedback mechanism where video agents
simulate user roles to give feedback on generated videos from previous
iterations and refine generation prompts. Experimental evaluations show that
SciTalk outperforms simple prompting methods in generating scientifically
accurate and engaging content over the refined loop of video generation.
Although preliminary results are still not yet matching human creators'
quality, our framework provides valuable insights into the challenges and
benefits of feedback-driven video generation. Our code, data, and generated
videos will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）评估中的核心挑战，包括从任务特定评估转向能力评估，以及从手动评估转向自动化评估，并指出了评估泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，评估方法需要适应其能力的扩展，本文旨在解决评估中的关键挑战。

Method: 分析两种关键转变：能力评估和自动化评估，并从方法、数据集、评估者和指标角度剖析问题。

Result: 提出了评估泛化问题，并计划通过GitHub仓库持续更新以应对快速发展的领域。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁贡献者和合作者共同解决LLMs评估中的挑战，并强调了持续更新的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing at an amazing speed and have
become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications. To keep
pace with the status quo, this survey probes the core challenges that the rise
of LLMs poses for evaluation. We identify and analyze two pivotal transitions:
(i) from task-specific to capability-based evaluation, which reorganizes
benchmarks around core competencies such as knowledge, reasoning, instruction
following, multi-modal understanding, and safety; and (ii) from manual to
automated evaluation, encompassing dynamic dataset curation and
"LLM-as-a-judge" scoring.
  Yet, even with these transitions, a crucial obstacle persists: the evaluation
generalization issue. Bounded test sets cannot scale alongside models whose
abilities grow seemingly without limit. We will dissect this issue, along with
the core challenges of the above two transitions, from the perspectives of
methods, datasets, evaluators, and metrics. Due to the fast evolving of this
field, we will maintain a living GitHub repository (links are in each section)
to crowd-source updates and corrections, and warmly invite contributors and
collaborators.

### [10] [Towards Robust Dialogue Breakdown Detection: Addressing Disruptors in Large Language Models with Self-Guided Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18839)
*Abdellah Ghassel,Xianzhi Li,Xiaodan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合微调与高级提示策略的方法，用于检测和缓解LLM驱动的对话系统中的对话崩溃问题，显著提升了性能并降低了成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在许多对话任务中表现出色，但仍可能产生不连贯或矛盾的响应（崩溃），影响用户信任。

Method: 结合专门微调与高级提示策略（如少样本学习、思维链推理和类比提示），并部署实时架构选择性升级可疑响应。

Result: 在英语和日语对话中展示了强大的分类和校准能力，在BETOLD数据集上准确率提升7%，同时降低了运营成本和能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法为高影响力领域提供了可扩展的解决方案，结合了效率、可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly changing various domains. However,
their capabilities in handling conversational breakdowns still require an
in-depth exploration. This paper addresses the challenge of detecting and
mitigating dialogue breakdowns within LLM-driven conversational systems. While
powerful models from OpenAI and Anthropic excel in many dialogue tasks, they
can still produce incoherent or contradictory responses, commonly referred to
as breakdowns, which undermine user trust. To tackle this, we propose an
approach that combines specialized fine-tuning with advanced prompting
strategies, including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and
analogical prompting. In particular, we fine-tune a small 8B model and
demonstrate its robust classification and calibration capabilities in English
and Japanese dialogue. We also validate its generalization on the BETOLD
dataset, achieving a 7\% accuracy improvement over its base model. Furthermore,
we introduce a real-time deployment architecture that selectively escalates
suspicious responses to more resource-intensive frontier models only when
breakdowns are detected, significantly cutting operational expenses and energy
consumption. Experimental results show our method surpasses prior
state-of-the-art specialized classifiers while also narrowing performance gaps
between smaller open-source models and large proprietary ones. Our approach
offers a scalable solution for robust conversational AI in high-impact domains
by combining efficiency, interpretability, and reliability.

### [11] [When2Call: When (not) to Call Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18851)
*Hayley Ross,Ameya Sunil Mahabaleshwarkar,Yoshi Suhara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新基准When2Call，用于评估语言模型在工具调用决策上的表现，包括何时调用工具、何时追问或承认无法回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注工具调用的准确性，而忽略了模型在何时应（不）调用工具的决策能力。

Method: 开发了When2Call基准，并利用其多选特性设计了一种偏好优化训练方法。

Result: 当前最先进的工具调用语言模型在When2Call上表现有显著改进空间，偏好优化训练比传统微调效果更好。

Conclusion: When2Call基准及其训练数据和方法为提升语言模型的工具调用决策能力提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Leveraging external tools is a key feature for modern Language Models (LMs)
to expand their capabilities and integrate them into existing systems. However,
existing benchmarks primarily focus on the accuracy of tool calling -- whether
the correct tool is called with the correct parameters -- and less on
evaluating when LMs should (not) call tools. We develop a new benchmark,
When2Call, which evaluates tool-calling decision-making: when to generate a
tool call, when to ask follow-up questions and when to admit the question can't
be answered with the tools provided. We find that state-of-the-art tool-calling
LMs show significant room for improvement on When2Call, indicating the
importance of this benchmark. We also develop a training set for When2Call and
leverage the multiple-choice nature of the benchmark to develop a preference
optimization training regime, which shows considerably more improvement than
traditional fine-tuning. We release the benchmark and training data as well as
evaluation scripts at https://github.com/NVIDIA/When2Call.

### [12] [Effective Length Extrapolation via Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18857)
*Yi Lu,Wanxu Zhao,Xin Zhou,Chenxin An,Chenglong Wang,Shuo Li,Yuming Yang,Jun Zhao,Tao Ji,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的框架DPE，通过分析RoPE的不同隐藏维度，扩展LLMs的上下文窗口。DPE显著优于现有方法，支持128k tokens的上下文，并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在处理长上下文时存在困难，现有扩展方法训练成本高。

Method: 提出DPE框架，通过调整关键维度的位置索引，优化预训练模型的长上下文能力。

Result: DPE显著提升模型性能，支持128k tokens上下文，性能优于GPT-4-128K。

Conclusion: DPE是一种高效、无需训练的长上下文扩展方法，性能卓越。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to process and generate coherent
context when the number of input tokens exceeds the pre-trained length. Recent
advancements in long-context extension have significantly expanded the context
window of LLMs but require expensive overhead to train the large-scale models
with longer context. In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional
Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the
context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions.
Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective
length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension.
We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the
pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their
most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with
minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal
state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such
as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of
128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash
Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also
dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as
Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER. When
compared with commercial models, Llama 3.1 70B with DPE even achieves better
performance than GPT-4-128K.

### [13] [Latent Adversarial Training Improves the Representation of Refusal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18872)
*Alexandra Abbas,Nora Petrova,Helios Ael Lyons,Natalia Perez-Campanero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型的拒绝行为主要编码在潜在空间的单一方向上，易受攻击。LAT通过训练噪声改变拒绝行为的编码，使其更集中在前两个SVD分量中，提高了鲁棒性但也暴露了新漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LAT如何通过噪声训练改变拒绝行为的潜在空间编码，以评估其有效性和局限性。

Method: 分析Llama 2 7B模型，比较LAT、SSFT和AT的拒绝行为编码，使用SVD分解激活差异。

Result: LAT显著改变拒绝行为的编码，集中在前两个SVD分量中（解释75%方差），提高了鲁棒性但对自身生成的攻击向量更脆弱。

Conclusion: LAT通过更全面的拒绝行为编码展示了改进模型安全的潜力，但也揭示了新漏洞。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models' refusal behavior is primarily
encoded in a single direction in their latent space, making it vulnerable to
targeted attacks. Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to
improve robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question
remains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying
representation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for
evaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear
refusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety
fine-tuning (SSFT).
  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the
refusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding
space adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between
harmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal
representation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain
approximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly
higher than in reference models. This concentrated representation leads to more
effective and transferable refusal vectors for ablation attacks: LAT models
show improved robustness when attacked with vectors from reference models but
become more vulnerable to self-generated vectors compared to SSFT and AT. Our
findings suggest that LAT's training perturbations enable a more comprehensive
representation of refusal behavior, highlighting both its potential strengths
and vulnerabilities for improving model safety.

*Junichiro Niimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的集成策略，用于提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在情感分析任务中的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了LLMs结果的变异性与可重复性问题，而实际人类标注通过多数投票解决分歧。

Method: 采用中等规模LLMs的多次推理集成策略。

Result: 集成方法比单次大型模型推理更鲁棒且准确，RMSE降低了18.6%。

Conclusion: 集成策略能有效提升LLMs在情感分析中的表现。

Abstract: With the advance of large language models (LLMs), LLMs have been utilized for
the various tasks. However, the issues of variability and reproducibility of
results from each trial of LLMs have been largely overlooked in existing
literature while actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve
disagreements among annotators. Therefore, this study introduces the
straightforward ensemble strategy to a sentiment analysis using LLMs. As the
results, we demonstrate that the ensemble of multiple inference using
medium-sized LLMs produces more robust and accurate results than using a large
model with a single attempt with reducing RMSE by 18.6%.

Motivation: 现有CSC方法在输出长度一致性和领域适应上表现不佳，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 基于RAG的MTCSC框架，结合检索数据库和长度反射机制，优化领域适应和长度一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MTCSC在领域特定和变长纠错任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTCSC框架有效提升了CSC任务的性能，尤其在领域适应和变长纠错方面。

Abstract: Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct erroneous tokens
in sentences. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success
in identifying and rectifying potential errors, they often struggle with
maintaining consistent output lengths and adapting to domain-specific
corrections. Furthermore, existing CSC task impose rigid constraints requiring
input and output lengths to be identical, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we extend traditional CSC to variable-length correction scenarios,
including Chinese Splitting Error Correction (CSEC) and ASR N-best Error
Correction. To address domain adaptation and length consistency, we propose
MTCSC (Multi-Turn CSC) framework based on RAG enhanced with a length reflection
mechanism. Our approach constructs a retrieval database from domain-specific
training data and dictionaries, fine-tuning retrievers to optimize performance
for error-containing inputs. Additionally, we introduce a multi-source
combination strategy with iterative length reflection to ensure output length
fidelity. Experiments across diverse domain datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms current approaches in correction quality,
particularly in handling domain-specific and variable-length error correction
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI法律数据集和模型局限于孤立子任务，无法支持端到端的法律决策，需填补这一空白。

Method: 引入LawFlow数据集，收集真实法律工作流程，比较人类与LLM生成的工作流程。

Result: 人类工作流程模块化且适应性强，LLM更线性且缺乏下游敏感性。法律专业人士更倾向于AI扮演支持性角色。

Conclusion: 提出设计建议，强调AI应支持人类目标，如清晰性、完整性和创造性，并指出LLM在复杂法律工作流程中的局限性。

Abstract: Legal practitioners, particularly those early in their careers, face complex,
high-stakes tasks that require adaptive, context-sensitive reasoning. While AI
holds promise in supporting legal work, current datasets and models are
narrowly focused on isolated subtasks and fail to capture the end-to-end
decision-making required in real-world practice. To address this gap, we
introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected
from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation
scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains
of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning
processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies
of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows,
revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan
execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows
are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications.
Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out
supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing
alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end. Building on
these findings, we propose a set of design suggestions, rooted in empirical
observations, that align AI assistance with human goals of clarity,
completeness, creativity, and efficiency, through hybrid planning, adaptive
execution, and decision-point support. Our results highlight both the current
limitations of LLMs in supporting complex legal workflows and opportunities for
developing more collaborative, reasoning-aware legal AI systems. All data and
code are available on our project page

*Sanwoo Lee,Jiahao Liu,Qifan Wang,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态Fisher加权合并方法（DF-Merge），通过贝叶斯优化调整参数系数，显著提升了多任务模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在性能差距，无法达到多任务微调的效果。

Method: 提出DF-Merge框架，结合贝叶斯优化动态调整参数系数，并基于Fisher信息整合参数重要性。

Result: DF-Merge在不同规模和任务上均优于基线方法，且只需少量验证数据和迭代即可接近最优性能。

Conclusion: DF-Merge通过统一合并策略，实现了高效且性能优越的多任务模型合并。

Abstract: The fine-tuning of pre-trained language models has resulted in the widespread
availability of task-specific models. Model merging offers an efficient way to
create multi-task models by combining these fine-tuned models at the parameter
level, without the need for training data or joint training on multiple
datasets. Existing merging approaches typically involve scaling the parameters
model-wise or integrating parameter importance parameter-wise. Both approaches
exhibit their own weaknesses, leading to a notable performance gap compared to
multi-task fine-tuning. In this paper, we unify these seemingly distinct
strategies into a more general merging framework, and introduce Dynamic
Fisher-weighted Merging (DF-Merge). Specifically, candidate models are
associated with a set of coefficients that linearly scale their fine-tuned
parameters. Bayesian optimization is applied to dynamically adjust these
coefficients, aiming to maximize overall performance on validation sets. Each
iteration of this process integrates parameter importance based on the Fisher
information conditioned by the coefficients. Experimental results show that
DF-Merge outperforms strong baselines across models of different sizes and a
variety of tasks. Our analysis shows that the effectiveness of DF-Merge arises
from the unified view of merging and that near-optimal performance is
achievable in a few iterations, even with minimal validation data.

*Mohammad Akbar-Tajari,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar,Mohammad Mahmoody*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GoAT是一种基于图结构的对抗性提示生成方法，用于测试大语言模型的安全性，比现有攻击方法更高效且无需访问模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗性攻击绕过安全机制，识别这些漏洞对增强模型鲁棒性至关重要。

Method: GoAT利用图结构框架生成对抗性提示，通过动态整合和优化推理路径，显著提高攻击成功率。

Result: GoAT在对抗性攻击中表现优异，对Llama等鲁棒模型的攻击成功率提升五倍，且生成的提示可读性强。

Conclusion: GoAT为LLM安全性测试提供了一种高效的黑盒攻击方法，其图结构框架优于传统树状推理方法。

Abstract: The challenge of ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with societal
standards is of increasing interest, as these models are still prone to
adversarial jailbreaks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Identifying these
vulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such
exploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating
adversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of
Thoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly
effective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than
state-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success
rate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality,
human-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's
parameters, making it a black-box attack. Unlike approaches constrained by
tree-based reasoning, GoAT's reasoning is based on a more intricate graph
structure. By making simultaneous attack paths aware of each other's progress,
this dynamic framework allows a deeper integration and refinement of reasoning
paths, significantly enhancing the collaborative exploration of adversarial
vulnerabilities in LLMs. At a technical level, GoAT starts with a graph
structure and iteratively refines it by combining and improving thoughts,
enabling synergy between different thought paths. The code for our
implementation can be found at: https://github.com/GoAT-pydev/Graph_of_Attacks.

Result: 领域特定模型（如SciBERT、BioBERT）表现优于通用模型，数据集增强和微调显著提升分类准确性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了数据集增强、推理驱动标签预测和微调技术在学术文本分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Efficient text classification is essential for handling the increasing volume
of academic publications. This study explores the use of pre-trained language
models (PLMs), including BERT, SciBERT, BioBERT, and BlueBERT, fine-tuned on
the Web of Science (WoS-46985) dataset for scientific text classification. To
enhance performance, we augment the dataset by executing seven targeted queries
in the WoS database, retrieving 1,000 articles per category aligned with
WoS-46985's main classes. PLMs predict labels for this unlabeled data, and a
hard-voting strategy combines predictions for improved accuracy and confidence.
Fine-tuning on the expanded dataset with dynamic learning rates and early
stopping significantly boosts classification accuracy, especially in
specialized domains. Domain-specific models like SciBERT and BioBERT
consistently outperform general-purpose models such as BERT. These findings
underscore the efficacy of dataset augmentation, inference-driven label
prediction, hard-voting, and fine-tuning techniques in creating robust and
scalable solutions for automated academic text classification.

Motivation: 在基于强化学习的知识蒸馏中，梯度估计方差较大，尤其是学生模型规模较大时，优化效果受限。

Method: 利用多步贝尔曼最优方程诱导k步回报，理论分析表明此方法可降低梯度估计方差。

Result: 在三个文本生成任务中，该方法在标准任务指标和基于大语言模型的评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: k步回报诱导为基于强化学习的知识蒸馏提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel k-step return estimation method (called KETCHUP) for
Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based knowledge distillation (KD) in text generation
tasks. Our idea is to induce a K-step return by using the Bellman Optimality
Equation for multiple steps. Theoretical analysis shows that this K-step
formulation reduces the variance of the gradient estimates, thus leading to
improved RL optimization especially when the student model size is large.
Empirical evaluation on three text generation tasks demonstrates that our
approach yields superior performance in both standard task metrics and large
language model (LLM)-based evaluation. These results suggest that our K-step
return induction offers a promising direction for enhancing RL-based KD in LLM
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大后验概率（MAP）解码在翻译质量上表现不佳，与真实翻译质量不匹配。

Method: 通过直接优化Pearson相关性来校准假设似然，提升翻译解码效果。

Result: 在有限训练（每方向2K实例）后，翻译质量显著提升，且与监督微调正交，覆盖10种语言。校准后的似然可直接作为翻译质量的强代理。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了MAP解码效率，还实现了与或超越现有翻译质量估计模型的性能，成果已开源。

Abstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems typically employ maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decoding to select the highest-scoring translation from the
distribution mass. However, recent evidence highlights the inadequacy of MAP
decoding, often resulting in low-quality or even pathological hypotheses -- the
decoding objective is not aligned with real-world translation quality. This
paper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from
a distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby
enhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,
translation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after
limited training (2K instances per direction). This improvement is orthogonal
to those achieved through supervised fine-tuning, leading to substantial gains
across a broad range of metrics and human evaluations -- even when applied to
top-performing translation-specialized LLMs fine-tuned on high-quality
translation data, such as Tower, or when compared to recent preference
optimization methods, like CPO. Moreover, the calibrated translation likelihood
can directly serve as a strong proxy for translation quality, closely
approximating or even surpassing some state-of-the-art translation quality
estimation models, like CometKiwi. Lastly, our in-depth analysis demonstrates
that calibration enhances the effectiveness of MAP decoding, thereby enabling
greater efficiency in real-world deployment. The resulting state-of-the-art
translation model, which covers 10 languages, along with the accompanying code
and human evaluation data, has been released to the community:

Conclusion: 开源LLMs在临床摘要中具有潜力，但需解决幻觉问题以确保信息可靠性，从而提升患者护理和治疗效果。

Abstract: Clinical summarization is crucial in healthcare as it distills complex
medical data into digestible information, enhancing patient understanding and
care management. Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential
in automating and improving the accuracy of such summarizations due to their
advanced natural language understanding capabilities. These models are
particularly applicable in the context of summarizing medical/clinical texts,
where precise and concise information transfer is essential. In this paper, we
investigate the effectiveness of open-source LLMs in extracting key events from
discharge reports, such as reasons for hospital admission, significant
in-hospital events, and critical follow-up actions. In addition, we also assess
the prevalence of various types of hallucinations in the summaries produced by
these models. Detecting hallucinations is vital as it directly influences the
reliability of the information, potentially affecting patient care and
treatment outcomes. We conduct comprehensive numerical simulations to
rigorously evaluate the performance of these models, further probing the
accuracy and fidelity of the extracted content in clinical summarization.

Motivation: 全球许多地区缺乏局部和细粒度的极端天气数据，限制了分析和决策能力。LLMs能够处理大量非结构化文本数据并提取有用信息。

Method: 提出EWRA方法，通过LLMs的推理路径增强SLMs，并构建ExtremeWeatherNews数据集，用于极端天气分类、主题标注和情感分析。

Result: EWRA方法显著提升了SLMs在极端天气分析任务中的表现，优于任务专用模型。

Conclusion: EWRA和ExtremeWeatherNews构成的ClimaEmpact框架为极端天气分析提供了高效解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate assessments of extreme weather events are vital for research and
policy, yet localized and granular data remain scarce in many parts of the
world. This data gap limits our ability to analyze potential outcomes and
implications of extreme weather events, hindering effective decision-making.
Large Language Models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of unstructured text
data, extract meaningful insights, and generate detailed assessments by
synthesizing information from multiple sources. Furthermore, LLMs can
seamlessly transfer their general language understanding to smaller models,
enabling these models to retain key knowledge while being fine-tuned for
specific tasks. In this paper, we propose Extreme Weather Reasoning-Aware
Alignment (EWRA), a method that enhances small language models (SLMs) by
incorporating structured reasoning paths derived from LLMs, and
ExtremeWeatherNews, a large dataset of extreme weather event-related news
articles. EWRA and ExtremeWeatherNews together form the overall framework,
ClimaEmpact, that focuses on addressing three critical extreme-weather tasks:
categorization of tangible vulnerabilities/impacts, topic labeling, and emotion
analysis. By aligning SLMs with advanced reasoning strategies on
ExtremeWeatherNews (and its derived dataset ExtremeAlign used specifically for
SLM alignment), EWRA improves the SLMs' ability to generate well-grounded and
domain-specific responses for extreme weather analytics. Our results show that
the approach proposed guides SLMs to output domain-aligned responses,
surpassing the performance of task-specific models and offering enhanced
real-world applicability for extreme weather analytics.

Abstract: This paper presents our process for developing a sample-efficient language
model for a conversational Hinglish chatbot. Hinglish, a code-mixed language
that combines Hindi and English, presents a unique computational challenge due
to inconsistent spelling, lack of standardization, and limited quality of
conversational data. This work evaluates multiple pre-trained cross-lingual

techniques to improve performance on Hinglish conversational tasks. The
proposed approach integrates synthetically generated dialogues with insights
from existing Hinglish datasets to address data scarcity. Experimental results
demonstrate that models with fewer parameters, when appropriately fine-tuned on
high-quality code-mixed data, can achieve competitive performance for Hinglish
conversation generation while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: 在多个数据集上，SCoT显著降低延迟并保持高性能。

Conclusion: SCoT为高效推理提供了新视角，平衡速度与准确性。

Abstract: Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have
recently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving
abilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy
thought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency.
Existing methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of
model parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we
introduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency
from another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large
and small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a
lightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the
error cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment
improves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains
the prediction accuracy for complex problems. Experimental results on GSM8K,
MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that SCoT reduces
reasoning latency by 48\%$\sim$66\% for Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B while
achieving near-target-model-level performance. Our code is available at

Conclusion: FedE4RAG为私有RAG系统提供了一种高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising
solution for enhancing the accuracy and credibility of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly in Question & Answer tasks. This is achieved by
incorporating proprietary and private data from integrated databases. However,
private RAG systems face significant challenges due to the scarcity of private
domain data and critical data privacy issues. These obstacles impede the
deployment of private RAG systems, as developing privacy-preserving RAG systems
requires a delicate balance between data security and data availability. To
address these challenges, we regard federated learning (FL) as a highly
promising technology for privacy-preserving RAG services. We propose a novel
framework called Federated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FedE4RAG). This
framework facilitates collaborative training of client-side RAG retrieval
models. The parameters of these models are aggregated and distributed on a
central-server, ensuring data privacy without direct sharing of raw data. In
FedE4RAG, knowledge distillation is employed for communication between the
server and client models. This technique improves the generalization of local
RAG retrievers during the federated learning process. Additionally, we apply
homomorphic encryption within federated learning to safeguard model parameters
and mitigate concerns related to data leakage. Extensive experiments conducted
on the real-world dataset have validated the effectiveness of FedE4RAG. The
results demonstrate that our proposed framework can markedly enhance the
performance of private RAG systems while maintaining robust data privacy
protection.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in formal
theorem proving, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to isolated, static
proof tasks, failing to capture the iterative, engineering-intensive workflows
of real-world formal mathematics libraries. Motivated by analogous advances in
software engineering, we introduce the paradigm of Automated Proof Engineering
(APE), which aims to automate proof engineering tasks such as feature addition,
proof refactoring, and bug fixing using LLMs. To facilitate research in this
direction, we present APE-Bench I, the first realistic benchmark built from
real-world commit histories of Mathlib4, featuring diverse file-level tasks
described in natural language and verified via a hybrid approach combining the
Lean compiler and LLM-as-a-Judge. We further develop Eleanstic, a scalable
parallel verification infrastructure optimized for proof checking across
multiple versions of Mathlib. Empirical results on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate strong performance on localized edits but substantial degradation
on handling complex proof engineering. This work lays the foundation for
developing agentic workflows in proof engineering, with future benchmarks
targeting multi-file coordination, project-scale verification, and autonomous
agents capable of planning, editing, and repairing formal libraries.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Self-Play Critic (SPC)的新方法，通过对抗性自玩游戏提升大型语言模型推理步骤的可靠性评估能力，无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（如Chain-of-Thought）推理步骤的可靠性具有挑战性，主要因为高质量步骤级监督数据难以获取且成本高昂。

Method: SPC通过微调两个基础模型分别扮演“狡猾生成器”和“批评家”角色，进行对抗性游戏。生成器制造难以检测的错误步骤，批评家则评估步骤正确性。通过强化学习迭代优化模型。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，SPC逐步提升错误检测能力（如ProcessBench准确率从70.8%提升至77.7%），并超越基线模型。应用于数学推理任务时，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SPC通过对抗性自玩游戏有效提升推理步骤的可靠性评估能力，为大型语言模型的推理过程提供了一种高效的无监督优化方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the step-by-step reliability of large language model (LLM)
reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought, remains challenging due to the difficulty
and cost of obtaining high-quality step-level supervision. In this paper, we
introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves
its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games,
eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning
two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that
deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a
"critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models
engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic,
while the critic model seeks to identify the generator's errors. Using
reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively
improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the
loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution.
Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K,
DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection
capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and
surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model. Furthermore, applying
SPC to guide the test-time search of diverse LLMs significantly improves their
mathematical reasoning performance on MATH500 and AIME2024, outperforming
state-of-the-art process reward models.

TL;DR: WuNeng架构通过结合RNN-based RWKV-7与高级注意力机制，提升大语言模型的表达能力和上下文连贯性，同时保持高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强大语言模型的表达能力和上下文连贯性，而非单纯减少KV缓存大小。

Method: 引入RWKV-7状态驱动头、跨头交互技术和多令牌状态处理机制，动态整合信息。

Result: 显著提升模型在复杂推理和序列生成任务中的表现，且参数增加极少。

Conclusion: WuNeng在表达能力和计算效率之间实现了新的平衡，为现代神经架构树立了新标准。

Abstract: The WuNeng architecture introduces a novel approach to enhancing the
expressivity and power of large language models by integrating recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based RWKV-7 with advanced attention mechanisms, prioritizing
heightened contextual coherence over reducing KV cache size. Building upon the
hybrid-head concept from Hymba, WuNeng augments standard multi-head attention
with additional RWKV-7 state-driven heads, rather than replacing existing
heads, to enrich the model's representational capacity. A cross-head
interaction technique fosters dynamic synergy among standard, state-driven, and
newly introduced middle heads, leveraging concatenation, additive modulation,
and gated fusion for robust information integration. Furthermore, a multi-token
state processing mechanism harnesses the continuous RWKV-7 state to capture
intricate, sequence-wide dependencies, significantly boosting expressivity.
Remarkably, these enhancements are achieved with minimal additional parameters,

Motivation: 研究动态嵌入式主题模型的实现选择，以指导其应用和进一步开发。

Method: 测量了不同实现选择对五个历时语料库的影响。

Result: 确定了词汇量规模和区间建模的优先级，发现某些因素对性能无显著影响。

Conclusion: 为动态嵌入式主题模型的应用和优化提供了实用建议。

Abstract: We measure the effects of several implementation choices for the Dynamic
Embedded Topic Model, as applied to five distinct diachronic corpora, with the
goal of isolating important decisions for its use and further development. We
identify priorities that will maximize utility in applied scholarship,
including the practical scalability of vocabulary size to best exploit the
strengths of embedded representations, and more flexible modeling of intervals
to accommodate the uneven temporal distributions of historical writing. Of
similar importance, we find performance is not significantly or consistently
affected by several aspects that otherwise limit the model's application or
might consume the resources of a grid search.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零资源幻觉检测框架，通过调整多种不确定性量化技术，生成标准化置信度评分，并引入可调集成方法优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在高风险领域的应用增加，幻觉问题日益突出，亟需有效的检测方法。

Method: 结合黑盒、白盒不确定性量化技术及LLM-as-a-Judge方法，生成0-1的置信度评分，并设计可调集成框架。

Result: 实验表明，可调集成方法优于单一组件及现有检测方法，提升了LLM的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 定制化幻觉检测策略能显著改善LLM性能，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a persistent problem with Large Language Models (LLMs). As
these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as
healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is
crucial. To this end, we propose a versatile framework for zero-resource
hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases.
To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ)
techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge,
transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence
scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we introduce a tunable
ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual
confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble
for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation,
the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit,
UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an
extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks.
We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components
and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results
demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for
improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.

Motivation: 传统评估指标（如BLEU、METEOR等）不适用于视觉叙事任务，因此需要更合适的评估方法。

Method: 利用多模态模型（特别是基于Transformer的架构和大规模多模态模型），结合VIST数据集，开发了VIST-GPT模型。

Result: VIST-GPT能够生成视觉基础和上下文适当的叙事，RoViST和GROOVIST指标更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: 新方法和评估指标为视觉叙事任务提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision
and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences
of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent
advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based
architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task.
Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT
model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We
address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU,
METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we
utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess
visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and
non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative
quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在NLP任务中潜力巨大，但由于高质量数据稀缺和人工标注成本高，其在移动设备上的应用受限。

Method: 开发AndroidGen框架，自动收集任务轨迹并训练开源LLM，避免人工标注。

Result: 在AndroidWorld、AitW等应用中验证了AndroidGen的改进效果，并指出未来优化方向。

Conclusion: AndroidGen为LLM在移动设备上的应用提供了有效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large language models have opened up a world of possibilities for various NLP
tasks, sparking optimism for the future. Despite their potential, LLMs have yet
to be widely used as agents on real mobile devices. The main challenge is the
need for high-quality data sources. Time constraints and labor intensity often
hinder human annotation. On the other hand, existing LLMs exhibit inadequate
completion rates and need a robust data filtration strategy. Given these
challenges, we develop a framework called AndroidGen to enhance the
capabilities of LLM-based agents under data scarcity. In addition, we leverage
AndroidGen to collect trajectories given human tasks and train open-source LLMs
on these trajectories to develop an open-source mobile agent without manually
labeled trajectories. We extensively evaluate AndroidGen with AndroidWorld,
AitW, and various popular applications, demonstrating its improvements and
revealing potential areas for future improvement. Code, model, and data are

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要针对英文，忽略了中文网页的语言、基础设施和审查复杂性。为了填补这一空白，研究者开发了BrowseComp-ZH，旨在全面评估LLM在中文环境中的表现。

Method: BrowseComp-ZH包含289个多跳问题，覆盖11个领域，每个问题基于简短、客观且易验证的答案反向设计。采用两阶段质量控制协议确保问题难度和答案唯一性。测试了20多个先进语言模型和代理搜索系统。

Result: 大多数模型表现不佳，准确率低于10%，仅少数超过20%。表现最佳的系统（OpenAI的DeepResearch）准确率为42.9%，表明BrowseComp-ZH的高难度。

Conclusion: BrowseComp-ZH展示了当前模型在复杂推理和信息整合方面的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。数据集和结果已公开。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-using agents, the ability to
browse the web in real-time has become a critical yardstick for measuring their
reasoning and retrieval competence. Existing benchmarks such as BrowseComp
concentrate on English and overlook the linguistic, infrastructural, and
censorship-related complexities of other major information ecosystems -- most
notably Chinese. To address this gap, we introduce BrowseComp-ZH, a
high-difficulty benchmark purpose-built to comprehensively evaluate LLM agents
on the Chinese web. BrowseComp-ZH consists of 289 multi-hop questions spanning
11 diverse domains. Each question is reverse-engineered from a short,
objective, and easily verifiable answer (e.g., a date, number, or proper noun).
A two-stage quality control protocol is applied to strive for high question
difficulty and answer uniqueness. We benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art
language models and agentic search systems on our proposed BrowseComp-ZH.
Despite their strong conversational and retrieval capabilities, most models
struggle severely: a large number achieve accuracy rates below 10%, and only a
handful exceed 20%. Even the best-performing system, OpenAI's DeepResearch,
reaches just 42.9%. These results demonstrate the considerable difficulty of
BrowseComp-ZH, where success demands not only effective retrieval strategies,
but also sophisticated reasoning and information reconciliation -- capabilities
that current models still struggle to master. Our dataset, construction
guidelines, and benchmark results have been publicly released at

Method: 1. 任务特定数据生成；2. 多任务预训练模型MultiTaskGuard；3. 搜索式模型合并方法生成UniGuard。

Result: 在多个数据集和基准测试中，提出的方法平均F1分数显著优于现有技术（如Aegis-LlamaGuard和gpt-4o）。

Conclusion: 任务特定数据生成和模型合并方法能显著提升效率与性能，为高效防护栏分类器提供了新方向。

Abstract: The trend towards large language models (LLMs) for guardrailing against
undesired behaviors is increasing and has shown promise for censoring user
inputs. However, increased latency, memory consumption, hosting expenses and
non-structured outputs can make their use prohibitive.
  In this work, we show that task-specific data generation can lead to
fine-tuned classifiers that significantly outperform current state of the art
(SoTA) while being orders of magnitude smaller. Secondly, we show that using a
single model, \texttt{MultiTaskGuard}, that is pretrained on a large
synthetically generated dataset with unique task instructions further improves
generalization. Thirdly, our most performant models, \texttt{UniGuard}, are
found using our proposed search-based model merging approach that finds an
optimal set of parameters to combine single-policy models and multi-policy
guardrail models. % On 7 public datasets and 4 guardrail benchmarks we created,
our efficient guardrail classifiers improve over the best performing SoTA

Motivation: 当前自动摘要方法未明确建模解释性内容，导致与人工摘要的匹配度不足。

Conclusion: 基于话语计划的摘要方法有效提升了自动生成解释性内容的能力。

Abstract: Lay summaries for scientific documents typically include explanations to help
readers grasp sophisticated concepts or arguments. However, current automatic
summarization methods do not explicitly model explanations, which makes it
difficult to align the proportion of explanatory content with human-written
summaries. In this paper, we present a plan-based approach that leverages
discourse frameworks to organize summary generation and guide explanatory
sentences by prompting responses to the plan. Specifically, we propose two
discourse-driven planning strategies, where the plan is conditioned as part of
the input or part of the output prefix, respectively. Empirical experiments on
three lay summarization datasets show that our approach outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of summary quality, and it enhances model
robustness, controllability, and mitigates hallucination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦上下文学习中的任务检索和任务学习模式，探索LLMs在密码任务中的表现。

Method: 引入基于替换密码的任务重构（ICL CIPHERS），测试LLMs在可逆与不可逆密码任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在可逆密码任务中表现优于不可逆任务，表明其具备一定的密码解码能力。

Conclusion: ICL CIPHERS为量化上下文学习中的‘学习’提供了新方法，LLMs在密码任务中展现出潜在的解码能力。

Abstract: Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual
modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and
task learning (inference-time ``learning'' from demonstrations). However,
disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL
CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed
from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the
in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering
English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there
is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This
bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task
in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question
if LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires
deciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL
CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline,
providing a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is
small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models.
Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in
their ability to decode the ciphered inputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQG数据集依赖预定义文本，无法反映真实课堂内容，且现有方法在视频内容问题生成上表现不佳。

Result: 新框架显著提升了生成问题的质量和相关性。

Conclusion: 研究填补了真实课堂EQG的空白，为智能教育系统提供了更实用的工具。

Abstract: Educational question generation (EQG) is a crucial component of intelligent
educational systems, significantly aiding self-assessment, active learning, and
personalized education. While EQG systems have emerged, existing datasets
typically rely on predefined, carefully edited texts, failing to represent
real-world classroom content, including lecture speech with a set of
complementary slides. To bridge this gap, we collect a dataset of educational
questions based on lectures from real-world classrooms. On this realistic
dataset, we find that current methods for EQG struggle with accurately
generating questions from educational videos, particularly in aligning with
specific timestamps and target answers. Common challenges include selecting
informative contexts from extensive transcripts and ensuring generated
questions meaningfully incorporate the target answer. To address the
challenges, we introduce a novel framework utilizing large language models for
dynamically selecting and rewriting contexts based on target timestamps and
answers. First, our framework selects contexts from both lecture transcripts
and video keyframes based on answer relevance and temporal proximity. Then, we
integrate the contexts selected from both modalities and rewrite them into
answer-containing knowledge statements, to enhance the logical connection
between the contexts and the desired answer. This approach significantly
improves the quality and relevance of the generated questions. Our dataset and
code are released in https://github.com/mengxiayu/COSER.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mem0的可扩展内存架构，通过动态提取、整合和检索对话中的关键信息，解决了大语言模型（LLM）在长时间多轮对话中上下文窗口固定的问题。其增强版本利用基于图的内存表示进一步捕捉对话元素的复杂关系。实验表明，Mem0在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，显著提升了对话连贯性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成上下文连贯的响应方面表现出色，但其固定的上下文窗口限制了长时间多轮对话的一致性。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了Mem0架构。

Method: Mem0是一种可扩展的内存中心架构，动态提取、整合和检索对话中的关键信息。增强版本进一步利用基于图的内存表示捕捉复杂关系。

Result: Mem0在LOCOMO基准测试中优于六类基线方法，显著提升了单跳、时序、多跳和开放域问题的性能。计算开销大幅降低，延迟和令牌成本分别减少91%和90%以上。

Conclusion: 结构化、持久的内存机制对长期对话连贯性至关重要，Mem0为高效可靠的LLM驱动AI代理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in
generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows
pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged
multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric
architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,
consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.
Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that
leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational
structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on
LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline
categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context
approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source
memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory
management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently
outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:
single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%
relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with
graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base
configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational
overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%
lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling
balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment
constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent
memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for
more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the dynamic optimization of the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) architecture. It proposes a state-aware dynamic knowledge
retrieval mechanism to enhance semantic understanding and knowledge scheduling
efficiency in large language models for open-domain question answering and
complex generation tasks. The method introduces a multi-level perceptive
retrieval vector construction strategy and a differentiable document matching
path. These components enable end-to-end joint training and collaborative
optimization of the retrieval and generation modules. This effectively
addresses the limitations of static RAG structures in context adaptation and
knowledge access. Experiments are conducted on the Natural Questions dataset.
The proposed structure is thoroughly evaluated across different large models,
including GPT-4, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek. Comparative and ablation experiments
from multiple perspectives confirm the significant improvements in BLEU and
ROUGE-L scores. The approach also demonstrates stronger robustness and
generation consistency in tasks involving semantic ambiguity and multi-document
fusion. These results highlight its broad application potential and practical
value in building high-quality language generation systems.

Result: LLMs在二元格式下表现出更一致的负面判断倾向，控制实验证实该偏差普遍存在。

Conclusion: 任务设计中的响应格式选择对LLMs的决策结果有显著影响，需谨慎以避免引入偏差。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks such as
psychological text analysis and decision-making in automated workflows.
However, their reliability remains a concern due to potential biases inherited
from their training process. In this study, we examine how different response
format: binary versus continuous, may systematically influence LLMs' judgments.
In a value statement judgments task and a text sentiment analysis task, we
prompted LLMs to simulate human responses and tested both formats across
several models, including both open-source and commercial models. Our findings
revealed a consistent negative bias: LLMs were more likely to deliver
"negative" judgments in binary formats compared to continuous ones. Control
experiments further revealed that this pattern holds across both tasks. Our
results highlight the importance of considering response format when applying
LLMs to decision tasks, as small changes in task design can introduce
systematic biases.

Result: 实验表明，新架构在多项指标上显著优于同类模型和LLM模型，且推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为长上下文幻觉检测提供了有效解决方案，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various tasks. However, they are prone to contextual hallucination, generating
information that is either unsubstantiated or contradictory to the given
context. Although many studies have investigated contextual hallucinations in
LLMs, addressing them in long-context inputs remains an open problem. In this
work, we take an initial step toward solving this problem by constructing a
dataset specifically designed for long-context hallucination detection.
Furthermore, we propose a novel architecture that enables pre-trained encoder
models, such as BERT, to process long contexts and effectively detect
contextual hallucinations through a decomposition and aggregation mechanism.
Our experimental results show that the proposed architecture significantly
outperforms previous models of similar size as well as LLM-based models across
various metrics, while providing substantially faster inference.

Result: 开源LLM表现接近专有模型，医学微调的旧架构模型表现不佳。性能因模型大小、语言、任务和临床专科而异。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为临床文本理解的LLM开发和评估提供了基础资源和参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and
are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace.
However, current evaluations of LLMs in clinical contexts remain limited. Most
existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived
text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world electronic health record
(EHR) data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting
their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we
present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks
sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. We
systematically evaluated 52 state-of-the-art LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1,
GPT-4o, Gemini, and Llama 4) under various inference strategies. With a total
of 13,572 experiments, our results reveal substantial performance variation
across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical
specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve
performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs
based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose
models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational
resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs
in real-world clinical text understanding.

Motivation: 随着NLP模型在现实应用中的普及，冲突信息可能导致模型不可靠，需系统性解决。

Result: 总结了冲突信息的来源和影响，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 开发冲突感知的NLP系统是未来关键方向，需更有效地处理冲突信息。

Abstract: As NLP models become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, it
becomes clear that there is a need to address the fact that models often rely
on and generate conflicting information. Conflicts could reflect the complexity
of situations, changes that need to be explained and dealt with, difficulties
in data annotation, and mistakes in generated outputs. In all cases,
disregarding the conflicts in data could result in undesired behaviors of
models and undermine NLP models' reliability and trustworthiness. This survey
categorizes these conflicts into three key areas: (1) natural texts on the web,
where factual inconsistencies, subjective biases, and multiple perspectives
introduce contradictions; (2) human-annotated data, where annotator
disagreements, mistakes, and societal biases impact model training; and (3)
model interactions, where hallucinations and knowledge conflicts emerge during
deployment. While prior work has addressed some of these conflicts in
isolation, we unify them under the broader concept of conflicting information,
analyze their implications, and discuss mitigation strategies. We highlight key
challenges and future directions for developing conflict-aware NLP systems that
can reason over and reconcile conflicting information more effectively.

TL;DR: 研究通过比较2020年和2024年关于特朗普的推文，发现AI对社交媒体语言和情感表达的影响，表现为情感极性增加和内容从中性转向积极。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型对社交媒体语言模式的潜在影响，特别是在AI介入沟通（AI-MC）后语言和情感表达的变化。

Method: 比较2020年（ChatGPT前）和2024年关于特朗普的推文数据集，使用Flesch-Kincaid可读性和极性评分分析文本复杂性和情感变化。

Result: 情感极性显著增加（0.12 vs. 0.04），中性内容减少（54.8%到39.8%），积极表达增加（28.6%到45.9%）。

Conclusion: AI在社交媒体中的存在增加，且对语言和情感表达模式产生了显著影响。

Abstract: Given the subtle human-like effects of large language models on linguistic
patterns, this study examines shifts in language over time to detect the impact
of AI-mediated communication (AI- MC) on social media. We compare a replicated
dataset of 970,919 tweets from 2020 (pre-ChatGPT) with 20,000 tweets from the
same period in 2024, all of which mention Donald Trump during election periods.
Using a combination of Flesch-Kincaid readability and polarity scores, we
analyze changes in text complexity and sentiment. Our findings reveal a
significant increase in mean sentiment polarity (0.12 vs. 0.04) and a shift
from predominantly neutral content (54.8% in 2020 to 39.8% in 2024) to more
positive expressions (28.6% to 45.9%). These findings suggest not only an
increasing presence of AI in social media communication but also its impact on
language and emotional expression patterns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识驱动的多智能体框架，用于生物医学领域的科学语料蒸馏，显著提升了大型语言模型在生物医学问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源生物医学语料库在数量和质量上不足，难以满足大型语言模型的需求，需解决生物医学知识复杂层次结构的挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体协作架构，每个智能体基于MeSH层次结构自主提取、合成和评估高质量文本数据，生成领域特定的问答对。

Result: 实验表明，基于该框架训练的模型在生物医学问答任务中表现优异，甚至超越GPT-4等先进专有模型。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作框架在生物医学语料蒸馏和LLM训练中具有显著潜力，能够高效生成高质量数据。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) in biomedical research has
underscored the limitations of existing open-source annotated scientific
corpora, which are often insufficient in quantity and quality. Addressing the
challenge posed by the complex hierarchy of biomedical knowledge, we propose a
knowledge-driven, multi-agent framework for scientific corpus distillation
tailored for LLM training in the biomedical domain. Central to our approach is
a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided
by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to
autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data
from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine
domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and
consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement.
Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our
multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical
question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines
and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables
Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger
scale. Detailed ablation studies and case analyses further validate the
effectiveness and synergy of each agent within the framework, highlighting the
potential of multi-agent collaboration in biomedical LLM training.

a low-resource language with limited annotated datasets. To address these
challenges, we developed a comprehensive annotated dataset using narrative
texts from VnExpress, a widely-read Vietnamese online news platform. We
established detailed guidelines for annotating entities, focusing on ensuring
consistency and accuracy. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of large
language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, on this dataset.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-4 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo in
terms of both accuracy and response consistency, making it a more reliable tool
for coreference resolution in Vietnamese.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VCM框架，通过自监督视觉概念建模提升LVLMs效率，减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在图像处理上效率低下，缺乏视觉概念模型，限制了实际应用。

Method: VCM采用端到端自监督框架，结合隐式对比学习和视觉语言微调，无需昂贵标注。

Result: VCM显著降低计算成本（如LLaVA-1.5-7B减少85% FLOPs），同时保持性能。

Conclusion: VCM有效提升视觉编码器能力，实验验证其高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are pivotal for real-world AI tasks like
embodied intelligence due to their strong vision-language reasoning abilities.
However, current LVLMs process entire images at the token level, which is
inefficient compared to humans who analyze information and generate content at
the conceptual level, extracting relevant visual concepts with minimal effort.
This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits
LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM,
an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages
implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and
vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without
requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM
significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\% fewer FLOPs for
LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image
understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in
classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM.

Motivation: 由于缺乏资源，中央库尔德语的词性标注任务未得到充分研究，现有标注集既不标准化也不全面。

Method: 研究整合了不同研究和库尔德语言学专家的词性标注，设计了一个标准化标注集，并用于标注大型CKL语料库。

Result: 与通用依赖框架的比较显示，该标注集能更准确地优化库尔德语NLP任务的句子处理。

Conclusion: 提出的词性标注集为库尔德语NLP任务提供了标准化支持，有望提升其性能。

Abstract: - The field of natural language processing (NLP) has dramatically expanded
within the last decade. Many human-being applications are conducted daily via
NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text
generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity
Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the
Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of
necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the
base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to
standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the
sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation.
Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are
neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an
accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance
of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from
different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized
part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large
CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this
study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard
languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct
sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态条件扩散模型MCD-TSF，结合时间戳和文本信息提升时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型主要关注单模态数值序列，忽略了时间序列中的多模态信息，如时间戳和文本。

Method: MCD-TSF联合利用时间戳和文本作为额外指导，时间戳用于建立数据点间的时空关联，文本作为历史数据的补充描述。

Result: 在八个领域的真实数据集上，MCD-TSF实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MCD-TSF通过多模态信息显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable success in processing images and text,
and have been extended to special domains such as time series forecasting
(TSF). Existing diffusion-based approaches for TSF primarily focus on modeling
single-modality numerical sequences, overlooking the rich multimodal
information in time series data. To effectively leverage such information for
prediction, we propose a multimodal conditioned diffusion model for TSF,
namely, MCD-TSF, to jointly utilize timestamps and texts as extra guidance for
time series modeling, especially for forecasting. Specifically, Timestamps are
combined with time series to establish temporal and semantic correlations among
different data points when aggregating information along the temporal
dimension. Texts serve as supplementary descriptions of time series' history,
and adaptively aligned with data points as well as dynamically controlled in a
classifier-free manner. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets
across eight domains demonstrate that the proposed MCD-TSF model achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and
fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of
combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the
accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.

methods, covering fundamental instance-level approaches, in-depth cluster-level
strategies, emerging scenario directions, and other miscellaneous but important
areas. At the instance level, we review model placement, request scheduling,
decoding length prediction, storage management, and the disaggregation
paradigm. At the cluster level, we explore GPU cluster deployment,
multi-instance load balancing, and cloud service solutions. For emerging
scenarios, we organize the discussion around specific tasks, modules, and
auxiliary methods. To ensure a holistic overview, we also highlight several
niche yet critical areas. Finally, we outline potential research directions to
further advance the field of LLM inference serving.

Motivation: 对话数据是理解学习过程的重要来源，但LLM在处理复杂上下文时面临挑战。本研究旨在解决这些挑战，提升对话数据自动编码的精度。

Method: 1) 使用角色提示和思维链方法预测对话代码；2) 结合GPT-4-turbo、GPT-4o和DeepSeek等多模型协作；3) 利用事件与行为的关系进行上下文一致性检查。

Result: 上下文一致性检查显著提升了准确性，行为预测的准确性高于事件预测。

Conclusion: 研究为对话数据自动编码提供了新方法框架，并解决了上下文复杂性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Dialogue data has been a key source for understanding learning processes,
offering critical insights into how students engage in collaborative
discussions and how these interactions shape their knowledge construction. The
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities
for advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of
dialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents
unique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and
interpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these
challenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for
dialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We
predict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics --
communicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following
the role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs
including GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We
leveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency
checking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking
provided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act
predictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study
contributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of
automated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for
addressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.

performance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for
low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于谱系关系的矩阵分解方法（LRMF），用于预测大型语言模型的性能，优于传统方法，解决了冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少大型语言模型开发中的计算成本和开发时间，传统方法忽视了模型间的谱系关系。

Method: 提出Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization（LRMF）框架，利用图拉普拉斯正则化编码模型间的谱系关系。

Result: 在2934个公开模型和21000多个实例的实验中，LRMF比基线方法提高了7-10%的相关性，并能有效解决冷启动问题。

Conclusion: LRMF为大型语言模型的开发提供了一种资源高效的性能预测方法，有助于优化超参数和数据选择。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) before
extensive fine-tuning or merging can substantially reduce both computational
expense and development time. Although prior approaches like scaling laws
account for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they
often overlook explicit lineage relationships - i.e., which models are derived
or merged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel
Lineage-Regularized Matrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes
ancestral ties among LLMs via a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging
multi-hop parent-child connections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional
matrix factorization and collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level
and benchmark-level performance prediction. Our large-scale study includes
2,934 publicly available Hugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6
major benchmarks, showing that lineage constraints yield up to 7-10 percentage
points higher correlation with actual performance compared to baselines.
Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing accurate
estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data. This
lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform
hyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM
development.

Result: 创造性内容增加认知负荷，人工翻译效果最显著；错误无显著影响。

Conclusion: 翻译创造性在词汇层面影响认知负荷，为未来研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: This article presents the results of a pilot study involving the reception of
a fictional short story translated from English into Dutch under four
conditions: machine translation (MT), post-editing (PE), human translation (HT)
and original source text (ST). The aim is to understand how creativity and
errors in different translation modalities affect readers, specifically
regarding cognitive load. Eight participants filled in a questionnaire, read a
story using an eye-tracker, and conducted a retrospective think-aloud (RTA)
interview. The results show that units of creative potential (UCP) increase
cognitive load and that this effect is highest for HT and lowest for MT; no
effect of error was observed. Triangulating the data with RTAs leads us to
hypothesize that the higher cognitive load in UCPs is linked to increases in
reader enjoyment and immersion. The effect of translation creativity on
cognitive load in different translation modalities at word-level is novel and
opens up new avenues for further research. All the code and data are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统DAPT需要大量领域数据的问题，特别是在非英语语言领域（如德语过程工业）中数据稀缺的情况。

Method: 利用ICL和kNN增强目标数据，减少GPU时间并保持模型性能。

Result: ICL-APT在平均IR指标上优于DAPT 3.5分，计算时间减少4倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源行业提供了成本效益高的解决方案，扩展了NLP在生产环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Domain-adaptive continual pretraining (DAPT) is a state-of-the-art technique
that further trains a language model (LM) on its pretraining task, e.g.,
language masking. Although popular, it requires a significant corpus of
domain-related data, which is difficult to obtain for specific domains in
languages other than English, such as the process industry in the German
language. This paper introduces an efficient approach called ICL-augmented
pretraining or ICL-APT that leverages in-context learning (ICL) and k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) to augment target data with domain-related and in-domain texts,
significantly reducing GPU time while maintaining strong model performance. Our
results show that this approach performs better than traditional DAPT by 3.5 of
the average IR metrics (e.g., mAP, MRR, and nDCG) and requires almost 4 times
less computing time, providing a cost-effective solution for industries with
limited computational capacity. The findings highlight the broader
applicability of this framework to other low-resource industries, making
NLP-based solutions more accessible and feasible in production environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型LLM服务系统semi-PD，通过分离计算与统一存储解决现有系统中的存储效率问题，显著提升高请求率下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统存在存储效率低的问题，如权重复制、KV缓存传输开销等，导致高请求率下性能下降。

Method: 设计semi-PD系统，分离计算资源（SM级别）并统一存储，引入计算资源控制器和统一内存管理器。

Result: 在DeepSeek和Llama模型上，semi-PD显著降低延迟并提升请求处理能力。

Conclusion: semi-PD通过计算与存储的优化设计，有效解决了现有系统的存储效率问题，提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories:
1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the
same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a
disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs.
The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and
sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage
challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent
flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3)
storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and
4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV
cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high
request rates.
  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system
lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational
resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose
a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation
and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller
to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)
level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access
from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism
between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic
partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request
rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on
DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency
constraints on Llama series models.

crucial role in many areas. With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models
(LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing
need for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification
are becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs.
Traditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs'
intrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by
prompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still
rely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and
inference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative
text classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one
framework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes
SFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy
dimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit
uncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and
perplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT
"policy warm-up," we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable
extra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets,
this improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that
benefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks
perform better without such reasoning steps. These insights into the role of
explicit reasoning provide valuable guidance for future LLM applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成的自主代理在众包事实核查中的潜力，发现其表现优于人类众包，且更少受偏见影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线错误信息的蔓延需要可扩展、可靠的事实核查解决方案，而众包方式虽成本低但质量不一。LLM的进步为众包工作流提供了新可能。

Method: 通过模拟具有多样性的生成代理群体，代理执行证据检索、多维质量评估和最终真实性判断。

Result: 代理群体在真实性分类、内部一致性和抗偏见能力上优于人类群体，决策更结构化。

Conclusion: 生成代理可成为众包事实核查系统中可扩展、一致且低偏见的贡献者。

Abstract: The growing spread of online misinformation has created an urgent need for
scalable, reliable fact-checking solutions. Crowdsourced fact-checking - where
non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to
expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias.
Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X
(formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from
centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.
  In parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and
evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows
remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative
agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making -
can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for
human crowds. Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate
crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles.
Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and
issue final veracity judgments.
  Our results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness
classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced
susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely
more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and
Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall,
our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable,
consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: TD-EVAL是一个两阶段评估框架，结合细粒度轮次分析和整体对话比较，提升任务导向对话系统的评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动指标无法检测任务导向对话系统中的关键中间错误，需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出TD-EVAL框架，包括轮次级评估（对话连贯性、后端知识一致性和策略合规性）和对话级比较（TOD Agent Arena）。

Result: 实验表明TD-EVAL能有效识别传统指标遗漏的错误，且与人工判断更一致。

Conclusion: TD-EVAL为任务导向对话系统评估提供了新范式，支持未来研究的即插即用框架。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by
Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these
systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional
automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus
solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors
that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce
TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework
that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level
comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific
dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy
compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons
to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ
2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the
conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL
exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based
metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for
TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a
plug-and-play framework for future research.

<details>

Motivation: 探索在领域特定任务中，教师模型、学生模型或两者是否需要适应领域，以优化知识蒸馏效果。

Method: 通过实验比较教师模型、学生模型或两者的SFT对蒸馏模型的影响，并研究词汇表和蒸馏算法的作用。

Result: 教师模型的SFT在相同词汇表下显著提升蒸馏模型性能，而两者SFT在所有指标上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在知识蒸馏中，对教师和学生模型进行SFT能提升性能，但效果受词汇表影响。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the approaches to reduce the size of
Large Language Models (LLMs). A LLM with smaller number of model parameters
(student) is trained to mimic the performance of a LLM of a larger size
(teacher model) on a specific task. For domain-specific tasks, it is not clear
if teacher or student model, or both, must be considered for domain adaptation.
In this work, we study this problem from perspective of telecom domain
Question-Answering (QA) task. We systematically experiment with Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) of teacher only, SFT of student only and SFT of both prior to
KD. We design experiments to study the impact of vocabulary (same and
different) and KD algorithms (vanilla KD and Dual Space KD, DSKD) on the
distilled model. Multi-faceted evaluation of the distillation using 14
different metrics (N-gram, embedding and LLM-based metrics) is considered.
Experimental results show that SFT of teacher improves performance of distilled
model when both models have same vocabulary, irrespective of algorithm and
metrics. Overall, SFT of both teacher and student results in better performance
across all metrics, although the statistical significance of the same depends
on the vocabulary of the teacher models.

Motivation: 随着LLM被恶意用于生成假新闻，研究其大规模发布对新闻生态系统的潜在影响。

Method: 开发了一个模拟管道和包含约56k条生成新闻的数据集，分析LLM假新闻在神经新闻推荐系统中的效果。

Result: 发现“真相衰减”现象，即真实新闻在排名中逐渐落后于假新闻，并从熟悉度角度解释了这一现象。

Conclusion: 呼吁利益相关者应对LLM假新闻的威胁，保护新闻生态系统的完整性。

Abstract: Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the
malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though
existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an
individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will
impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and
a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects
of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our
findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing
its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated
news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation
about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the
positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss
the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We
urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity
of news ecosystems.

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言中的事实准确性仍需改进，尤其是在区域语境下的表现。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
effectiveness across various languages, particularly in high-resource languages
such as English. However, their performance in terms of factual accuracy across
other low-resource languages, especially Indic languages, remains an area of
investigation. In this study, we assess the factual accuracy of LLMs - GPT-4o,
Gemma-2-9B, Gemma-2-2B, and Llama-3.1-8B - by comparing their performance in
English and Indic languages using the IndicQuest dataset, which contains
question-answer pairs in English and 19 Indic languages. By asking the same
questions in English and their respective Indic translations, we analyze
whether the models are more reliable for regional context questions in Indic
languages or when operating in English. Our findings reveal that LLMs often
perform better in English, even for questions rooted in Indic contexts.
Notably, we observe a higher tendency for hallucination in responses generated
in low-resource Indic languages, highlighting challenges in the multilingual
understanding capabilities of current LLMs.

Motivation: 提高大型语言模型推理效率，同时保持生成质量。

Method: 采用半贪婪搜索算法和轻量级分类器预测可跳过的令牌。

Result: 在GSM8K推理中实现1.5倍令牌接受率提升，准确率下降小于1%。

Conclusion: AutoJudge能跨任务泛化，显著提升推理速度且保持质量。

Abstract: We introduce AutoJudge, a framework that accelerates large language model
(LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of
matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify
which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the generated
response, relaxing the guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be
generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test
which of the mismatches between target and draft model should be corrected to
preserve quality, and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight
classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time,
which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final
answer quality. We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B
(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more
accepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer
accuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss
in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, our approach
automatically detects other, programming-specific important tokens and shows
similar speedups, demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要关注知识评估，忽略了模型在基础数学和视觉概念上的推理能力，阻碍了AGI的发展。

Method: 提出VCBENCH，包含1,720个问题和6,697张图像，覆盖六个认知领域，评估26个LVLM。

Result: 顶级模型在VCBENCH上的准确率不足50%，显示视觉-数学整合的挑战。

Conclusion: VCBENCH揭示了LVLM在视觉-数学推理上的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly enhanced their ability to integrate visual and linguistic
information, achieving near-human proficiency in tasks like object recognition,
captioning, and visual question answering. However, current benchmarks
typically focus on knowledge-centric evaluations that assess domain-specific
expertise, often neglecting the core ability to reason about fundamental
mathematical elements and visual concepts. We identify a gap in evaluating
elementary-level math problems, which rely on explicit visual
dependencies-requiring models to discern, integrate, and reason across multiple
images while incorporating commonsense knowledge, all of which are crucial for
advancing toward broader AGI capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce
VCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for multimodal mathematical reasoning with
explicit visual dependencies. VCBENCH includes 1,720 problems across six
cognitive domains, featuring 6,697 images (averaging 3.9 per question) to
ensure multi-image reasoning. We evaluate 26 state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCBENCH,
revealing substantial performance disparities, with even the top models unable
to exceed 50% accuracy. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenges in
visual-mathematical integration and suggest avenues for future LVLM
advancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于准确标注数据的稀缺性，尤其是在标注耗时且易出错的任务中，现有SSL方法依赖预训练特征和大验证集，且标签数据通常随机采样，忽略了信息量更大的样本。

Method: active-DeepFA通过结合对比学习、元伪标签和主动学习，在非预训练CNN架构中实现图像分类。采用双网络协同训练以减少伪标签的确认偏差，并通过标签传播和主动标注提升性能。

Result: 在三个生物图像数据集上，仅使用5%的标签数据，active-DeepFA超越了基线和其他六种SoTA方法，并在仅3%标签数据下达到可比结果。

Conclusion: active-DeepFA在标签数据稀缺的情况下显著提升了分类性能，同时减少了标注成本。

Abstract: A major challenge that prevents the training of DL models is the limited
availability of accurately labeled data. This shortcoming is highlighted in
areas where data annotation becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task. In
this regard, SSL tackles this challenge by capitalizing on scarce labeled and
abundant unlabeled data; however, SoTA methods typically depend on pre-trained
features and large validation sets to learn effective representations for
classification tasks. In addition, the reduced set of labeled data is often
randomly sampled, neglecting the selection of more informative samples. Here,
we present active-DeepFA, a method that effectively combines CL,
teacher-student-based meta-pseudo-labeling and AL to train non-pretrained CNN
architectures for image classification in scenarios of scarcity of labeled and
abundance of unlabeled data. It integrates DeepFA into a co-training setup that
implements two cooperative networks to mitigate confirmation bias from
pseudo-labels. The method starts with a reduced set of labeled samples by
warming up the networks with supervised CL. Afterward and at regular epoch
intervals, label propagation is performed on the 2D projections of the
networks' deep features. Next, the most reliable pseudo-labels are exchanged
between networks in a cross-training fashion, while the most meaningful samples
are annotated and added into the labeled set. The networks independently
minimize an objective loss function comprising supervised contrastive,
supervised and semi-supervised loss components, enhancing the representations
towards image classification. Our approach is evaluated on three challenging
biological image datasets using only 5% of labeled samples, improving baselines
and outperforming six other SoTA methods. In addition, it reduces annotation
effort by achieving comparable results to those of its counterparts with only
3% of labeled data.

Conclusion: SORT3D是一种高效的方法，能够在少量数据下学习并零样本泛化到新环境，为机器人操作提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpreting object-referential language and grounding objects in 3D with
spatial relations and attributes is essential for robots operating alongside
humans. However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes,
large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language
references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural
language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn
from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these
challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes
from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the
ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning.
Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can
be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two
benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous
vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal
navigation on previously unseen real-world environments. All source code for
the system pipeline is publicly released at https://github.com/nzantout/SORT3D .

Abstract: Video summarization creates an abridged version (i.e., a summary) that
provides a quick overview of the video while retaining pertinent information.
In this work, we focus on summarizing instructional videos and propose a method
for breaking down a video into meaningful segments, each corresponding to
essential steps in the video. We propose \textbf{HierSum}, a hierarchical
approach that integrates fine-grained local cues from subtitles with global
contextual information provided by video-level instructions. Our approach
utilizes the ``most replayed" statistic as a supervisory signal to identify
critical segments, thereby improving the effectiveness of the summary. We
evaluate on benchmark datasets such as TVSum, BLiSS, Mr.HiSum, and the WikiHow
test set, and show that HierSum consistently outperforms existing methods in
key metrics such as F1-score and rank correlation. We also curate a new
multi-modal dataset using WikiHow and EHow videos and associated articles
containing step-by-step instructions. Through extensive ablation studies, we
demonstrate that training on this dataset significantly enhances summarization
on the target datasets.

Abstract: This review provides a systematic analysis of comprehensive survey of 3D

at the intersection of 3D vision and multimodal AI. By examining over 100

open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot generalization. We review key
architectures, pretraining strategies, and prompt engineering methods that
align textual and 3D features for effective 3D object detection with
vision-language models. Visualization examples and evaluation benchmarks are
discussed to illustrate performance and behavior. Finally, we highlight current
challenges, such as limited 3D-language datasets and computational demands, and
propose future research directions to advance 3D object detection with

Motivation: 深度神经网络在训练和测试数据同分布时表现良好，但OOD检测仍具挑战性。现有方法难以可视化异常值，限制了OOD失败模式的分析。

Method: 使用扩散模型在像素空间生成对象级异常值，训练目标检测器进行OOD检测。

Result: Dream-Box性能与传统方法相当，并首次实现OOD对象的可视化。

Conclusion: Dream-Box为OOD检测提供了新的解决方案，结合了性能与可视化优势。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated great generalization capabilities for
tasks whose training and test sets are drawn from the same distribution.
Nevertheless, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains a challenging task
that has received significant attention in recent years. Specifically, OOD
detection refers to the detection of instances that do not belong to the
training distribution, while still having good performance on the
in-distribution task (e.g., classification or object detection). Recent work
has focused on generating synthetic outliers and using them to train an outlier
detector, generally achieving improved OOD detection than traditional OOD
methods. In this regard, outliers can be generated either in feature or pixel
space. Feature space driven methods have shown strong performance on both the
classification and object detection tasks, at the expense that the
visualization of training outliers remains unknown, making further analysis on
OOD failure modes challenging. On the other hand, pixel space outlier
generation techniques enabled by diffusion models have been used for image
classification using, providing improved OOD detection performance and outlier
visualization, although their adaption to the object detection task is as yet
unexplored. We therefore introduce Dream-Box, a method that provides a link to
object-wise outlier generation in the pixel space for OOD detection.
Specifically, we use diffusion models to generate object-wise outliers that are
used to train an object detector for an in-distribution task and OOD detection.
Our method achieves comparable performance to previous traditional methods
while being the first technique to provide concrete visualization of generated
OOD objects.

<details>

Motivation: 手术动作的多样性和模糊边界导致传统分割方法效果不佳，需要一种更精确的方法来捕捉动作的起始和结束点。

Method: 采用多阶段边界感知Transformer网络（MSBATN），结合分层滑动窗口注意力和统一的损失函数，将动作分类与边界检测作为独立但相互依赖的任务处理。

Conclusion: MSBATN通过创新的边界投票机制和统一损失函数，显著提升了动作分割的准确性，为手术视频分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Understanding actions within surgical workflows is essential for evaluating
post-operative outcomes. However, capturing long sequences of actions performed
in surgical settings poses challenges, as individual surgeons have their unique
approaches shaped by their expertise, leading to significant variability. To
tackle this complex problem, we focused on segmentation with precise
boundaries, a demanding task due to the inherent variability in action
durations and the subtle transitions often observed in untrimmed videos. These
transitions, marked by ambiguous starting and ending points, complicate the
segmentation process. Traditional models, such as MS-TCN, which depend on large
receptive fields, frequently face challenges of over-segmentation (resulting in
fragmented segments) or under-segmentation (merging distinct actions). Both of
these issues negatively impact the quality of segmentation. To overcome these
challenges, we present the Multi-Stage Boundary-Aware Transformer Network
(MSBATN) with hierarchical sliding window attention, designed to enhance action
segmentation. Our proposed approach incorporates a novel unified loss function
that treats action classification and boundary detection as distinct yet

boundary voting mechanism accurately identifies start and end points by
leveraging contextual information. Extensive experiments using three
challenging surgical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art results in F1 scores at thresholds
of 25% and 50%, while also delivering comparable performance in other metrics.

Abstract: The perception of vehicles and pedestrians in urban scenarios is crucial for
autonomous driving. This process typically involves complicated data
collection, imposes high computational and hardware demands. To address these
limitations, we first develop a highly efficient method for generating virtual

Subsequently, we propose CenterDepth, a lightweight architecture for monocular
depth estimation that ensures high operational efficiency and exhibits superior
performance in depth estimation tasks with highly imbalanced height-scale
distributions. CenterDepth integrates global semantic information through the
innovative Center FC-CRFs algorithm, aggregates multi-scale features based on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具无法捕捉IoT网络流数据中的序列和空间模式，限制了Transformer模型的应用。

Method: 从.pcap文件提取特征，将数据转换为1通道2D图像形状，并扩展ViT以支持多种分类器（如DNN、LSTM、BLSTM）。

Result: 在两种IoT攻击数据集上，模型（DNN、LSTM、BLSTM）在多类攻击检测中表现出色，精度、召回率和F1分数均具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将ViT应用于IoT攻击检测，并通过扩展分类器选择提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of transformer models in NLP, and
image and video classification, the available tools for extracting features
from captured IoT network flow packets fail to capture sequential patterns in
addition to the absence of spatial patterns consequently limiting transformer
model application. This work introduces a novel preprocessing method to adapt
transformer models, the vision transformer (ViT) in particular, for IoT botnet
attack detection using network flow packets. The approach involves feature
extraction from .pcap files and transforming each instance into a 1-channel 2D
image shape, enabling ViT-based classification. Also, the ViT model was
enhanced to allow use any classifier besides Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) that
was deployed in the initial ViT paper. Models including the conventional feed
forward Deep Neural Network (DNN), LSTM and Bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM)
demonstrated competitive performance in terms of precision, recall, and
F1-score for multiclass-based attack detection when evaluated on two IoT attack
datasets.

Method: 开发了反映真实场景多样性的任务，引入动态错误样本记忆单元记录多任务中的错误，并采用自适应双速更新策略平衡新任务和历史任务的权重更新。

Conclusion: CAMeL框架简单有效，显著提升了文本行人检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an
image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation
and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm
of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit
domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise
the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a
domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive
Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during
pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we
develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of
real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to
memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further
ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update
strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for
historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing
state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES,
ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in
handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations. Our code is

Conclusion: 多视角视频输入和完整序列训练能有效提升超声心动图自动解读的准确性。

Abstract: Echocardiography involves recording videos of the heart using ultrasound,
enabling clinicians to evaluate its condition. Recent advances in large-scale
vision-language models (VLMs) have garnered attention for automating the
interpretation of echocardiographic videos. However, most existing VLMs
proposed for medical interpretation thus far rely on single-frame (i.e., image)
inputs. Consequently, these image-based models often exhibit lower diagnostic
accuracy for conditions identifiable through cardiac motion. Moreover,
echocardiographic videos are recorded from various views that depend on the
direction of ultrasound emission, and certain views are more suitable than
others for interpreting specific conditions. Incorporating multiple views could
potentially yield further improvements in accuracy. In this study, we developed
a video-language model that takes five different views and full video sequences
as input, training it on pairs of echocardiographic videos and clinical reports
from 60,747 cases. Our experiments demonstrate that this expanded approach
achieves higher interpretation accuracy than models trained with only
single-view videos or with still images.

Result: 实验表明，JULNet在视频生成的高保真和音频-唇同步方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JULNet通过联合学习视觉误差和不确定性，显著提升了说话人脸视频生成的性能。

Abstract: Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant
challenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies
have emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual
quality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual
uncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including
inconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input
conditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning
Network (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which
incorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual
error. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually
predict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.
The error map represents the difference between the generated image and the
ground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the
probability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty
distribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we
introduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly
optimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model
can be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video
generation compared to previous methods.

Abstract: In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on
aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this
approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification,
tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail
that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel
multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract
histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual
descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment
at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more
effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using
a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from
multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader
range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature
representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization
across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with
34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and
tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath. The code is available on

Conclusion: SIV方法为高湍流复杂流场的流速测量提供了有效解决方案，相关数据和实现已开源。

Abstract: The need for accurate and non-intrusive flow measurement methods has led to
the widespread adoption of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), a powerful
diagnostic tool in fluid motion estimation. This study investigates the
tremendous potential of spike cameras (a type of ultra-high-speed,
high-dynamic-range camera) in PIV. We propose a deep learning framework, Spike
Imaging Velocimetry (SIV), designed specifically for highly turbulent and
intricate flow fields. To aggregate motion features from the spike stream while
minimizing information loss, we incorporate a Detail-Preserving Hierarchical
Transform (DPHT) module. Additionally, we introduce a Graph Encoder (GE) to
extract contextual features from highly complex fluid flows. Furthermore, we
present a spike-based PIV dataset, Particle Scenes with Spike and Displacement
(PSSD), which provides labeled data for three challenging fluid dynamics
scenarios. Our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to
existing baseline methods on PSSD. The datasets and our implementation of SIV
are open-sourced in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频暴力检测方法依赖欧几里得表示学习，难以区分视觉相似但语义不同的事件，且缺乏模糊训练样本。

Method: PiercingEye采用双曲聚合策略和跨空间注意力机制，结合大语言模型生成模糊事件描述，并通过双曲视觉语言对比损失进行监督。

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准测试中达到最优性能，尤其在模糊事件子集上表现突出。

Conclusion: PiercingEye在细粒度暴力检测中表现出色，验证了其双空间学习框架的有效性。

Abstract: Existing weakly supervised video violence detection (VVD) methods primarily
rely on Euclidean representation learning, which often struggles to distinguish
visually similar yet semantically distinct events due to limited hierarchical
modeling and insufficient ambiguous training samples. To address this
challenge, we propose PiercingEye, a novel dual-space learning framework that
synergizes Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries to enhance discriminative
feature representation. Specifically, PiercingEye introduces a layer-sensitive
hyperbolic aggregation strategy with hyperbolic Dirichlet energy constraints to
progressively model event hierarchies, and a cross-space attention mechanism to
facilitate complementary feature interactions between Euclidean and hyperbolic
spaces. Furthermore, to mitigate the scarcity of ambiguous samples, we leverage
large language models to generate logic-guided ambiguous event descriptions,
enabling explicit supervision through a hyperbolic vision-language contrastive
loss that prioritizes high-confusion samples via dynamic similarity-aware
weighting. Extensive experiments on XD-Violence and UCF-Crime benchmarks
demonstrate that PiercingEye achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
particularly strong results on a newly curated ambiguous event subset,
validating its superior capability in fine-grained violence detection.

Abstract: As an essential component of logistics automation, the automated loading
system is becoming a critical technology for enhancing operational efficiency
and safety. Precise automatic positioning of the truck compartment, which
serves as the loading area, is the primary step in automated loading. However,
existing methods have difficulty adapting to truck compartments of various
sizes, do not establish a unified coordinate system for LiDAR and mobile
manipulators, and often exhibit reliability issues in cluttered environments.
To address these limitations, our study focuses on achieving precise automatic
positioning of key points in large, medium, and small fence-style truck
compartments in cluttered scenarios. We propose an innovative wide
field-of-view 3-D LiDAR vehicle compartment automatic localization system. For
vehicles of various sizes, this system leverages the LiDAR to generate
high-density point clouds within an extensive field-of-view range. By
incorporating parking area constraints, our vehicle point cloud segmentation
method more effectively segments vehicle point clouds within the scene. Our
compartment key point positioning algorithm utilizes the geometric features of
the compartments to accurately locate the corner points, providing stackable
spatial regions. Extensive experiments on our collected data and public
datasets demonstrate that this system offers reliable positioning accuracy and
reduced computational resource consumption, leading to its application and
promotion in relevant fields.

Abstract: 3D face reconstruction (3DFR) algorithms are based on specific assumptions
tailored to the limits and characteristics of the different application
scenarios. In this study, we investigate how multiple state-of-the-art 3DFR
algorithms can be used to generate a better representation of subjects, with
the final goal of improving the performance of face recognition systems in
challenging uncontrolled scenarios. We also explore how different parametric
and non-parametric score-level fusion methods can exploit the unique strengths
of multiple 3DFR algorithms to enhance biometric recognition robustness. With
this goal, we propose a comprehensive analysis of several face recognition
systems across diverse conditions, such as varying distances and camera setups,
intra-dataset and cross-dataset, to assess the robustness of the proposed
ensemble method. The results demonstrate that the distinct information provided
by different 3DFR algorithms can alleviate the problem of generalizing over
multiple application scenarios. In addition, the present study highlights the
potential of advanced fusion strategies to enhance the reliability of
3DFR-based face recognition systems, providing the research community with key
insights to exploit them in real-world applications effectively. Although the
experiments are carried out in a specific face verification setup, our proposed
fusion-based 3DFR methods may be applied to other tasks around face biometrics
that are not strictly related to identity recognition.

Result: 实验证明S2R在鲁棒性和泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: S2R通过简化噪声分布学习任务，显著提升了水印技术的效果。

Abstract: Unauthorized screen capturing and dissemination pose severe security threats
such as data leakage and information theft. Several studies propose robust
watermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images,
facilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques
typically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network
fitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC.
However, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective
approximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased
approximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence
of interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require
paired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model
to learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose
Simulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs
unpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeling simulated noise
distribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly
learning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this
transformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it
primarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the
complex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details. Extensive
experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method,
demonstrating superior watermark robustness and generalization compared to
those of state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: R-Sparse R-CNN是一种高效且准确的SAR船舶检测框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce R-Sparse R-CNN, a novel pipeline for oriented ship detection in
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that leverages sparse learnable proposals
enriched with background contextual information, termed background-aware
proposals (BAPs). The adoption of sparse proposals streamlines the pipeline by
eliminating the need for proposal generators and post-processing for
overlapping predictions. The proposed BAPs enrich object representation by
integrating ship and background features, allowing the model to learn their
contextual relationships for more accurate distinction of ships in complex
environments. To complement BAPs, we propose Dual-Context Pooling (DCP), a
novel strategy that jointly extracts ship and background features in a single
unified operation. This unified design improves efficiency by eliminating
redundant computation inherent in separate pooling. Moreover, by ensuring that
ship and background features are pooled from the same feature map level, DCP
provides aligned features that improve contextual relationship learning.
Finally, as a core component of contextual relationship learning in R-Sparse
R-CNN, we design a dedicated transformer-based Interaction Module. This module
interacts pooled ship and background features with corresponding proposal
features and models their relationships. Experimental results show that
R-Sparse R-CNN delivers outstanding accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art
models by margins of up to 12.8% and 11.9% on SSDD and RSDD-SAR inshore
datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and
competitiveness of R-Sparse R-CNN as a robust framework for oriented ship
detection in SAR imagery. The code is available at:

Abstract: Convolutional neural network (CNN) slides a kernel over the whole image to
produce an output map. This kernel scheme reduces the number of parameters with
respect to a fully connected neural network (NN). While CNN has proven to be an
effective model in recognition of handwritten characters and traffic signal
sign boards, etc. recently, its deep variants have proven to be effective in
similar as well as more challenging applications like object, scene and action
recognition. Deep CNN add more layers and kernels to the classical CNN,
increasing the number of parameters, and partly reducing the main advantage of
CNN which is less parameters. In this paper, a 3D pyramidal neural network
called 3DPyraNet and a discriminative approach for spatio-temporal feature
learning based on it, called 3DPyraNet-F, are proposed. 3DPyraNet introduces a
new weighting scheme which learns features from both spatial and temporal
dimensions analyzing multiple adjacent frames and keeping a biological
plausible structure. It keeps the spatial topology of the input image and
presents fewer parameters and lower computational and memory costs compared to
both fully connected NNs and recent deep CNNs. 3DPyraNet-F extract the features
maps of the highest layer of the learned network, fuse them in a single vector,
and provide it as input in such a way to a linear-SVM classifier that enhances
the recognition of human actions and dynamic scenes from the videos.
Encouraging results are reported with 3DPyraNet in real-world environments,
especially in the presence of camera induced motion. Further, 3DPyraNet-F

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中数据增强的领域差距和碎片化研究问题，统一评估先进混合策略的效果。

Method: 集成六种混合增强方法（MixUp、YOCO等）与卷积和Transformer架构，在脑瘤MRI和眼底数据集上测试。

Result: MixUp和SnapMix分别在ResNet-50和ViT-B上对脑瘤分类效果最佳；YOCO和CutMix在眼底分类中表现最优。

Conclusion: MediAug为医学影像数据增强提供了可复现的基准，展示了混合增强策略的显著效果。

Abstract: Data augmentation is essential in medical imaging for improving
classification accuracy, lesion detection, and organ segmentation under limited
data conditions. However, two significant challenges remain. First, a
pronounced domain gap between natural photographs and medical images can
distort critical disease features. Second, augmentation studies in medical
imaging are fragmented and limited to single tasks or architectures, leaving
the benefits of advanced mix-based strategies unclear. To address these
challenges, we propose a unified evaluation framework with six mix-based
augmentation methods integrated with both convolutional and transformer
backbones on brain tumour MRI and eye disease fundus datasets. Our
contributions are threefold. (1) We introduce MediAug, a comprehensive and
reproducible benchmark for advanced data augmentation in medical imaging. (2)
We systematically evaluate MixUp, YOCO, CropMix, CutMix, AugMix, and SnapMix
with ResNet-50 and ViT-B backbones. (3) We demonstrate through extensive
experiments that MixUp yields the greatest improvement on the brain tumor
classification task for ResNet-50 with 79.19% accuracy and SnapMix yields the
greatest improvement for ViT-B with 99.44% accuracy, and that YOCO yields the
greatest improvement on the eye disease classification task for ResNet-50 with
91.60% accuracy and CutMix yields the greatest improvement for ViT-B with
97.94% accuracy. Code will be available at

framework to address generalizability and scalability limitations to multi
person visual human analysis. VISUALCENT leverages centroid based bottom up
keypoint detection paradigm and uses Keypoint Heatmap incorporating Disk
Representation and KeyCentroid to identify the optimal keypoint coordinates.
For the unified segmentation task, an explicit keypoint is defined as a dynamic
centroid called MaskCentroid to swiftly cluster pixels to specific human
instance during rapid changes in human body movement or significantly occluded
environment. Experimental results on COCO and OCHuman datasets demonstrate
VISUALCENTs accuracy and real time performance advantages, outperforming
existing methods in mAP scores and execution frame rate per second. The
implementation is available on the project page.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent
breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost
of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components,
involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and
breadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent
view of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike
earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in
isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the
main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining
the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image
synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object
generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical
deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To
support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that
introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with
the knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map
future research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven
character-animation technologies. This survey is intended as a resource for
researchers and developers entering the field of generative AI animation or
adjacent fields. Resources are available at:

Motivation: 解决CNN在HSI分类中计算成本高、泛化能力差及域偏移问题。

Method: 采用双分支残差网络整合特征，引入原型优化和核概率匹配策略。

Result: 在四个公开HSI数据集上表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了小样本场景下的分类性能和跨数据集适应性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective for hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification, but their 3D convolutional structures introduce high
computational costs and limited generalization in few-shot scenarios. Domain
shifts caused by sensor differences and environmental variations further hinder
cross-dataset adaptability. Metric-based few-shot learning (FSL) prototype
networks mitigate this problem, yet their performance is sensitive to prototype
quality, especially with limited samples. To overcome these challenges, a
dual-branch residual network that integrates spatial and spectral features via
parallel branches is proposed in this letter. Additionally, more robust refined
prototypes are obtained through a regulation term. Furthermore, a kernel
probability matching strategy aligns source and target domain features,
alleviating domain shift. Experiments on four publicly available HSI datasets
illustrate that the proposal achieves superior performance compared to other
methods.

Conclusion: HoloDx通过结合知识和数据，显著改进了AD诊断的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires effectively
integrating multimodal data and clinical expertise. However, existing methods
often struggle to fully utilize multimodal information and lack structured
mechanisms to incorporate dynamic domain knowledge. To address these
limitations, we propose HoloDx, a knowledge- and data-driven framework that
enhances AD diagnosis by aligning domain knowledge with multimodal clinical
data. HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware
gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate
domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical
expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory
attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific
information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging
these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and
effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data. Evaluations on
five AD datasets demonstrate that HoloDx outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and strong generalization across diverse
cohorts. The source code will be released upon publication acceptance.

Result: 两种方法均能训练出无需人工编码规则的驾驶策略，并在闭环模拟和实际ADAS中验证了性能。

Conclusion: 端到端学习方法在自动驾驶中具有潜力，能够简化系统并提高性能。

Abstract: Most self-driving systems rely on hand-coded perception outputs and
engineered driving rules. Learning directly from human driving data with an
end-to-end method can allow for a training architecture that is simpler and
scales well with compute and data.
  In this work, we propose an end-to-end training architecture that uses real
driving data to train a driving policy in an on-policy simulator. We show two
different methods of simulation, one with reprojective simulation and one with
a learned world model. We show that both methods can be used to train a policy
that learns driving behavior without any hand-coded driving rules. We evaluate
the performance of these policies in a closed-loop simulation and when deployed
in a real-world advanced driver-assistance system.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have significantly advanced deep learning by enhancing
feature representation through selective focus. However, existing approaches
often independently model channel importance and spatial saliency, overlooking
their inherent interdependence and limiting their effectiveness. To address
this limitation, we propose MIA-Mind, a lightweight and modular
Multidimensional Interactive Attention Mechanism, built upon the MindSpore
framework. MIA-Mind jointly models spatial and channel features through a
unified cross-attentive fusion strategy, enabling fine-grained feature
recalibration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on three representative datasets: on CIFAR-10, MIA-Mind achieves an
accuracy of 82.9\%; on ISBI2012, it achieves an accuracy of 78.7\%; and on
CIC-IDS2017, it achieves an accuracy of 91.9\%. These results validate the
versatility, lightweight design, and generalization ability of MIA-Mind across
heterogeneous tasks. Future work will explore the extension of MIA-Mind to
large-scale datasets, the development of ada,ptive attention fusion strategies,
and distributed deployment to further enhance scalability and robustness.

Method: 设计了跨模态和区域感知特征交互机制，以及跨域提案精炼与混合策略。

Result: 在Cityscapes-C和DWD基准数据集上分别提升了8.8%和7.9%的mPC。

Conclusion: 新方法在S-DGOD任务中表现出色，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train an object
detector on a single source domain while generalizing well to diverse unseen
target domains, making it suitable for multimedia applications that involve
various domain shifts, such as intelligent video surveillance and VR/AR
technologies. With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent
S-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide
invariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized
knowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of
adverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization
for guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in
varying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning
method, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for
S-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and
Region-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal
and intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between
fine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but
effective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which
aligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies
them, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our
method achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with
improvements of +8.8\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\%~mPC on DWD over
baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: LASP框架能泛化处理不同延迟水平，显著提升边缘设备上的3D感知性能。

Abstract: Although existing 3D perception algorithms have demonstrated significant
improvements in performance, their deployment on edge devices continues to
encounter critical challenges due to substantial runtime latency. We propose a
new benchmark tailored for online evaluation by considering runtime latency.
Based on the benchmark, we build a Latency-Aware 3D Streaming Perception (LASP)
framework that addresses the latency issue through two primary components: 1)
latency-aware history integration, which extends query propagation into a
continuous process, ensuring the integration of historical feature regardless
of varying latency; 2) latency-aware predictive detection, a module that
compensates the detection results with the predicted trajectory and the
posterior accessed latency. By incorporating the latency-aware mechanism, our
method shows generalization across various latency levels, achieving an online
performance that closely aligns with 80\% of its offline evaluation on the
Jetson AGX Orin without any acceleration techniques.

Result: 实验表明，改进的SAC+BK-SVD算法在盲图像分离任务中表现优于传统K-SVD方法。

Conclusion: 基于稀疏表示的方法在BSS中具有潜力，改进的块稀疏字典学习算法进一步提升了分离质量。

Abstract: Blind source separation (BSS) is a key technique in array processing and data
analysis, aiming to recover unknown sources from observed mixtures without
knowledge of the mixing matrix. Classical independent component analysis (ICA)
methods rely on the assumption that sources are mutually independent. To
address limitations of ICA, sparsity-based methods have been introduced, which
decompose source signals sparsely in a predefined dictionary. Morphological
Component Analysis (MCA), based on sparse representation theory, assumes that a
signal is a linear combination of components with distinct geometries, each
sparsely representable in one dictionary and not in others. This approach has
recently been applied to BSS with promising results.
  This report reviews key approaches derived from classical ICA and explores
sparsity-based methods for BSS. It introduces the theory of sparse
representation and decomposition, followed by a block coordinate relaxation MCA
algorithm, whose variants are used in Multichannel MCA (MMCA) and Generalized
MCA (GMCA). A local dictionary learning method using K-SVD is then presented.
Finally, we propose an improved algorithm, SAC+BK-SVD, which enhances K-SVD by
learning a block-sparsifying dictionary that clusters and updates similar atoms
in blocks.
  The implementation includes experiments on image segmentation and blind image
source separation using the discussed techniques. We also compare the proposed
block-sparse dictionary learning algorithm with K-SVD. Simulation results
demonstrate that our method yields improved blind image separation quality.

Motivation: 现有LLIE方法忽略语义信息，尤其是在极暗区域，导致信息丢失严重。

Method: 采用Retinex图像分解，结合预训练的语义分割模型和视觉语言模型，设计多尺度语义感知结构。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepSPG通过多模态语义先验指导，显著提升了低光图像增强效果。

Abstract: There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit
various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image
enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between
low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information
of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer
from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep
semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition
for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic
segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both
image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a
multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance
for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the
enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance
by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic
segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural
language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a
multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic
feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark
datasets. The implementation details and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAR和RGB图像融合中模态异质性和光谱互补性未充分利用的问题。

Method: PAD框架包含相位谱校正（PSC）和振幅谱融合（ASF），分别处理共享结构和模态特定特征。

Result: 在WHU-OPT-SAR和DDHR-SK数据集上表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PAD为遥感中的多模态融合提供了新范式，代码将开源。

Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover
classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and the
underutilization of spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to
decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric
attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this
issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework
that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific)
components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key
components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase
features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency,
and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates
high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive
multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to
morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on
WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our
work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote
sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

TL;DR: 提出RadioFormer，一种多粒度Transformer模型，用于解决无线电地图估计中空间稀疏观测的挑战，通过双流自注意力和跨流交叉注意力模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度视觉模型（如U-Net）在无线电地图估计中需要足够空间观测（0.01%-1%像素），而实际场景中观测可能极其稀疏，亟需新方法。

Method: 设计RadioFormer，包含双流自注意力（DSA）模块和跨流交叉注意力（CCA）模块，分别学习像素级信号功率相关性和块级建筑物几何特征。

Result: 在RadioMapSeer数据集上，RadioFormer优于现有方法，计算成本最低，且具有出色的泛化能力和零样本性能。

Conclusion: RadioFormer为无线电地图估计提供了一种更实用的解决方案，适用于观测节点极少的场景。

Abstract: The task of radio map estimation aims to generate a dense representation of
electromagnetic spectrum quantities, such as the received signal strength at
each grid point within a geographic region, based on measurements from a subset
of spatially distributed nodes (represented as pixels). Recently, deep vision
models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose
effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically
0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed
signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less
practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling
can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a
novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed
by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream
self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of
pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings'
geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into
multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention
(CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset
demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map
estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the
proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust
zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map
estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.

Method: 采用多平面图像（MPI）确保几何一致性，并通过随机重建目标或参考相机空间的训练机制学习单目视频。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无需显式3D重建或多视角训练数据的情况下，仍能实现高质量的虚拟形象和新视角渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且具有竞争力，适用于VR等沉浸式体验。

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D-aware diffusion-based method for generating
photorealistic talking head videos directly from a single identity image and
explicit control signals (e.g., expressions). Our method generates Multiplane
Images (MPIs) that ensure geometric consistency, making them ideal for
immersive viewing experiences like binocular videos for VR headsets. Unlike
existing methods that often require a separate stage or joint optimization to
reconstruct a 3D representation (such as NeRF or 3D Gaussians), our approach
directly generates the final output through a single denoising process,
eliminating the need for post-processing steps to render novel views
efficiently. To effectively learn from monocular videos, we introduce a
training mechanism that reconstructs the output MPI randomly in either the
target or the reference camera space. This approach enables the model to
simultaneously learn sharp image details and underlying 3D information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which
achieves competitive avatar quality and novel-view rendering capabilities, even
without explicit 3D reconstruction or high-quality multi-view training data.

Conclusion: SOTA框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为自动驾驶场景中的异常检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With the emergence of transformer-based architectures and large language
models (LLMs), the accuracy of road scene perception has substantially
advanced. Nonetheless, current road scene segmentation approaches are
predominantly trained on closed-set data, resulting in insufficient detection
capabilities for out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. To overcome this
limitation, road anomaly detection methods have been proposed. However,
existing methods primarily depend on image inpainting and OOD distribution
detection techniques, facing two critical issues: (1) inadequate consideration
of the objectiveness attributes of anomalous regions, causing incomplete
segmentation when anomalous objects share similarities with known classes, and
(2) insufficient attention to environmental constraints, leading to the
detection of anomalies irrelevant to autonomous driving tasks. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework termed Segmenting Objectiveness and Task-Awareness
(SOTA) for autonomous driving scenes. Specifically, SOTA enhances the

achieving robust and accurate segmentation outcomes.

Result: 在多数据集评估中，LRFusionPR实现了高精度地点识别，并在不同天气条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LRFusionPR有效解决了LiDAR-雷达融合的挑战，为自动驾驶地点识别提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization
in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods
have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas
radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging
LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and
sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition
accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the
development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we
propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by
fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a
dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified
polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch,
cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The
knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the
distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the
robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated,
producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves
accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather
conditions. Our open-source code will be released at
https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间-光谱双域自适应学习的水下图像增强方法SS-UIE，解决了现有方法未同时考虑空间区域和光谱波段退化不一致的问题，并通过频率损失函数强化高频细节区域的恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习型水下图像增强方法未能同时处理不同空间区域和光谱波段的退化不一致性，且忽视了高频细节区域的恢复难度。

Method: 提出SS-UIE方法，结合空间多尺度循环选择性扫描模块（MCSS）和光谱自注意力模块（SWSA）构建SS-block，并引入频率损失函数（FWL）优化高频区域恢复。

Result: 实验表明SS-UIE在性能和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SS-UIE通过双域自适应学习和频率损失函数，显著提升了水下图像增强的效果和效率。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) methods have
demonstrated promising performance. However, existing learning-based methods
still face two challenges. 1) They rarely consider the inconsistent degradation
levels in different spatial regions and spectral bands simultaneously. 2) They
treat all regions equally, ignoring that the regions with high-frequency
details are more difficult to reconstruct. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel UIE method based on spatial-spectral dual-domain adaptive
learning, termed SS-UIE. Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise
Multi-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise
Self-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in
parallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the
global receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the
degradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby
enabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple
SS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network. Additionally, a Frequency-Wise Loss
(FWL) is introduced to narrow the frequency-wise discrepancy and reinforce the
model's attention on the regions with high-frequency details. Extensive
experiments validate that the SS-UIE technique outperforms state-of-the-art UIE
methods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.

TL;DR: FlexPara是一种无监督神经优化框架，通过自适应变形的2D UV坐标实现全局和多图表表面参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化方法需要高质量网格三角剖分且拓扑受限，FlexPara旨在提供更灵活可控的处理流程。

Result: 实验证明FlexPara具有普适性、优越性和潜力。

Conclusion: FlexPara为表面参数化提供了新的神经优化范式，代码已公开。

Abstract: Surface parameterization is a fundamental geometry processing task, laying
the foundations for the visual presentation of 3D assets and numerous
downstream shape analysis scenarios. Conventional parameterization approaches
demand high-quality mesh triangulation and are restricted to certain simple
topologies unless additional surface cutting and decomposition are provided. In
practice, the optimal configurations (e.g., type of parameterization domains,
distribution of cutting seams, number of mapping charts) may vary drastically
with different surface structures and task characteristics, thus requiring more
flexible and controllable processing pipelines. To this end, this paper
introduces FlexPara, an unsupervised neural optimization framework to achieve
both global and multi-chart surface parameterizations by establishing
point-wise mappings between 3D surface points and adaptively-deformed 2D UV
coordinates. We ingeniously design and combine a series of
geometrically-interpretable sub-networks, with specific functionalities of
cutting, deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, to construct a bi-directional
cycle mapping framework for global parameterization without the need for
manually specified cutting seams. Furthermore, we construct a multi-chart
parameterization framework with adaptively-learned chart assignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential
of our neural surface parameterization paradigm. The code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/AidenZhao/FlexPara

Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展，尤其是基于指令的图像编辑，对数字图像的真实性构成威胁，现有防御系统难以检测这些细微篡改。

Method: 提出CapsFake，通过多模态胶囊网络整合视觉、文本和频域特征，利用竞争路由机制动态聚合局部特征以识别篡改区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，CapsFake检测准确率比现有方法高20%，对自然扰动和对抗攻击的检测率分别超过94%和96%。

Conclusion: CapsFake为对抗复杂图像篡改提供了强大框架，具有优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake technology, particularly in
instruction-guided image editing, threatens the integrity of digital images by
enabling subtle, context-aware manipulations. Generated conditionally from real
images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans
and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current
defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to
detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual,
textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted
through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features
to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets,
including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits,
CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection
accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates
above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with
excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios. This approach establishes
a powerful framework for countering sophisticated image manipulations.

Motivation: 光谱成像在不同领域应用广泛，但相机间的通道维度和波长差异限制了AI方法的通用性，导致模型难以跨相机适用。

Method: 引入波长位置编码和自注意力-交叉注意力机制，将光谱信息压缩为学习到的查询表示，并通过自监督JEPA策略进行光谱-空间预训练。

Result: 在医学影像、自动驾驶和卫星成像等领域的大规模实验中，CARL表现出对光谱异质性的独特鲁棒性，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CARL的扩展性和多功能性使其成为未来光谱基础模型的骨干。

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains,
including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as
a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel
dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the
development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with
limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address
this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for
$\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation
$\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging
modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel
dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength
positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress
spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial
pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired
strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of
medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our
model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets
with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability
and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for
future spectral foundation models.

Result: 在S-Up3D数据集上，重建误差降低了70%以上。

Conclusion: 高容量模型结合局部低秩约束能显著提升3D形状预测的准确性。

Abstract: For non-rigid objects, predicting the 3D shape from 2D keypoint observations
is ill-posed due to occlusions, and the need to disentangle changes in
viewpoint and changes in shape. This challenge has often been addressed by
embedding low-rank constraints into specialized models. These models can be
hard to train, as they depend on finding a canonical way of aligning
observations, before they can learn detailed geometry. These constraints have
limited the reconstruction quality. We show that generic, high capacity models,
trained with an unsupervised loss, allow for more accurate predicted shapes. In
particular, applying low-rank constraints to localized subsets of the full
shape allows the high capacity to be suitably constrained. We reduce the
state-of-the-art reconstruction error on the S-Up3D dataset by over 70%.

Result: 实验证明该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: SALCR通过细粒度语义对齐和动态优化，显著提升了跨模态行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) seeks to
match pedestrian images of the same individual across different modalities
without human annotations for model learning. Previous methods unify
pseudo-labels of cross-modality images through label association algorithms and
then design contrastive learning framework for global feature learning.
However, these methods overlook the cross-modality variations in feature
representation and pseudo-label distributions brought by fine-grained patterns.
This insight results in insufficient modality-shared learning when only global
features are optimized. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Aligned
Learning with Collaborative Refinement (SALCR) framework, which builds up
optimization objective for specific fine-grained patterns emphasized by each
modality, thereby achieving complementary alignment between the label
distributions of different modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a Dual
Association with Global Learning (DAGI) module to unify the pseudo-labels of
cross-modality instances in a bi-directional manner. Afterward, a Fine-Grained
Semantic-Aligned Learning (FGSAL) module is carried out to explore part-level
semantic-aligned patterns emphasized by each modality from cross-modality
instances. Optimization objective is then formulated based on the
semantic-aligned features and their corresponding label space. To alleviate the
side-effects arising from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a Global-Part
Collaborative Refinement (GPCR) module to mine reliable positive sample sets
for the global and part features dynamically and optimize the inter-instance
relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, which achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估目标检测XAI方法的标准，阻碍了方法比较和选择。

Method: 引入ODExAI框架，评估XAI方法在目标检测中的表现，使用YOLOX和Faster R-CNN及标准数据集进行实验。

Result: 区域方法（如D-CLOSE）定位准确（88.49%）且忠实度高（0.863），但计算开销大（71.42s）；CAM方法（如G-CAME）定位更优（96.13%）且速度快（0.54s），但忠实度较低（0.549）。

Conclusion: 不同XAI方法存在关键权衡，需根据任务需求选择。ODExAI框架和实验数据已开源。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques for interpreting object
detection models remain in an early stage, with no established standards for
systematic evaluation. This absence of consensus hinders both the comparative
analysis of methods and the informed selection of suitable approaches. To
address this gap, we introduce the Object Detection Explainable AI Evaluation
(ODExAI), a comprehensive framework designed to assess XAI methods in object
detection based on three core dimensions: localization accuracy, faithfulness
to model behavior, and computational complexity. We benchmark a set of XAI
methods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and
standard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that
region-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%)
and high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational
overhead (Time = 71.42s). On the other hand, CAM-based methods (e.g., G-CAME)
achieve superior localization (PG = 96.13%) and significantly lower runtime
(Time = 0.54s), but at the expense of reduced faithfulness (OA = 0.549). These
findings demonstrate critical trade-offs among existing XAI approaches and
reinforce the need for task-specific evaluation when deploying them in object
detection pipelines. Our implementation and evaluation benchmarks are publicly
available at: https://github.com/Analytics-Everywhere-Lab/odexai.

Conclusion: LM-MCVT在合成和真实3D数据中均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In human-centered environments such as restaurants, homes, and warehouses,
robots often face challenges in accurately recognizing 3D objects. These
challenges stem from the complexity and variability of these environments,
including diverse object shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Lightweight
Multi-modal Multi-view Convolutional-Vision Transformer network (LM-MCVT) to
enhance 3D object recognition in robotic applications. Our approach leverages
the Globally Entropy-based Embeddings Fusion (GEEF) method to integrate
multi-views efficiently. The LM-MCVT architecture incorporates pre- and
mid-level convolutional encoders and local and global transformers to enhance
feature extraction and recognition accuracy. We evaluate our method on the
synthetic ModelNet40 dataset and achieve a recognition accuracy of 95.6% using
a four-view setup, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. To further
validate its effectiveness, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation on the
real-world OmniObject3D dataset using the same configuration. Results
consistently show superior performance, demonstrating the method's robustness
in 3D object recognition across synthetic and real-world 3D data.

Conclusion: OPAL为LiDAR地点识别提供了一种高效、轻量级的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: LiDAR place recognition is a critical capability for autonomous navigation
and cross-modal localization in large-scale outdoor environments. Existing
approaches predominantly depend on pre-built 3D dense maps or aerial imagery,
which impose significant storage overhead and lack real-time adaptability. In
this paper, we propose OPAL, a novel network for LiDAR place recognition that
leverages OpenStreetMap as a lightweight and up-to-date prior. Our key
innovation lies in bridging the domain disparity between sparse LiDAR scans and
structured OSM data through two carefully designed components: a cross-modal
visibility mask that identifies maximal observable regions from both modalities
to guide feature learning, and an adaptive radial fusion module that
dynamically consolidates multiscale radial features into discriminative global
descriptors. Extensive experiments on the augmented KITTI and KITTI-360
datasets demonstrate OPAL's superiority, achieving 15.98% higher recall at @1m
threshold for top-1 retrieved matches while operating at 12x faster inference
speeds compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Code and datasets are publicly

Conclusion: RF-GS方法通过量化不均匀性和优化数据策略，显著提升了场景视图合成的渲染稳定性。

Abstract: Scene view synthesis, which generates novel views from limited perspectives,
is increasingly vital for applications like virtual reality, augmented reality,
and robotics. Unlike object-based tasks, such as generating 360{\deg} views of
a car, scene view synthesis handles entire environments where non-uniform
observations pose unique challenges for stable rendering quality. To address
this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian
splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a
renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual
consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an
image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles.
Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses
information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures. Comparative
experiments on simulated and real-world data show that our method outperforms
existing approaches in rendering stability.

Result: 新初始化方法在多种信号模态（图像、音频、3D重建）中表现优异，特别是对高斯INR效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法具有普适性和稳定性，显著提升了INR的性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a versatile and powerful tool for
encoding various forms of data, including images, videos, sound, and 3D shapes.
A critical factor in the success of INRs is the initialization of the network,
which can significantly impact the convergence and accuracy of the learned
model. Unfortunately, commonly used neural network initializations are not
widely applicable for many activation functions, especially those used by INRs.
In this paper, we improve upon previous initialization methods by deriving an
initialization that has stable variance across layers, and applies to any
activation function. We show that this generalizes many previous initialization
methods, and has even better stability for well studied activations. We also
show that our initialization leads to improved results with INR activation
functions in multiple signal modalities. Our approach is particularly effective
for Gaussian INRs, where we demonstrate that the theory of our initialization
matches with task performance in multiple experiments, allowing us to achieve
improvements in image, audio, and 3D surface reconstruction.

Abstract: Gaze target detection (GTD) is the task of predicting where a person in an
image is looking. This is a challenging task, as it requires the ability to
understand the relationship between the person's head, body, and eyes, as well
as the surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a novel method for
GTD that fuses multiple pieces of information extracted from an image. First,
we project the 2D image into a 3D representation using monocular depth
estimation. We then extract a depth-infused saliency module map, which
highlights the most salient (\textit{attention-grabbing}) regions in image for
the subject in consideration. We also extract face and depth modalities from
the image, and finally fuse all the extracted modalities to identify the gaze
target. We quantitatively evaluated our method, including the ablation analysis
on three publicly available datasets, namely VideoAttentionTarget, GazeFollow
and GOO-Real, and showed that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
This suggests that our method is a promising new approach for GTD.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification presents significant challenges due
to the high dimensionality, spectral redundancy, and limited labeled data

optimize classification performance, we propose a novel band selection strategy
known as Iterative Wavelet-based Gradient Sampling (IWGS). This method
incrementally selects the most informative spectral bands by analyzing
gradients within the wavelet-transformed domain, enabling efficient and
targeted dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional selection methods, IWGS
leverages the multi-resolution properties of wavelets to better capture subtle
spectral variations relevant for classification. The iterative nature of the
approach ensures that redundant or noisy bands are systematically excluded
while maximizing the retention of discriminative features. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark HSI datasets: Houston
2013 and Indian Pines. Results demonstrate that IWGS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art band selection and classification techniques in terms of both
accuracy and computational efficiency. These improvements make our method
especially suitable for deployment in edge devices or other
resource-constrained environments, where memory and processing power are
limited. In particular, IWGS achieved an overall accuracy up to 97.8% on Indian
Pines for selected classes, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability
across different HSI scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过生成配对数据集来提升水下视频质量，解决了现有方法因缺乏配对数据而无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频因光吸收、散射和噪声（如海洋雪花）导致质量下降，影响机器视觉任务。现有方法因缺乏配对数据而效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种新框架，从原始水下视频生成配对数据集（含雪花和无雪花图像），用于监督训练。

Result: 生成的配对数据集有效提升了水下图像恢复效果，尤其在缺乏真实数据的情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决水下视频增强问题提供了新的数据生成和训练途径。

Abstract: Underwater videos often suffer from degraded quality due to light absorption,
scattering, and various noise sources. Among these, marine snow, which is
suspended organic particles appearing as bright spots or noise, significantly
impacts machine vision tasks, particularly those involving feature matching.
Existing methods for removing marine snow are ineffective due to the lack of
paired training data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel
enhancement framework that introduces a new approach for generating paired
datasets from raw underwater videos. The resulting dataset consists of paired
images of generated snowy and snow, free underwater videos, enabling supervised
training for video enhancement. We describe the dataset creation process,
highlight its key characteristics, and demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing underwater image restoration in the absence of ground truth.

Abstract: The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has driven remarkable progress in
low-light image enhancement (LLIE), with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs and
Transformers) and color spaces (e.g., sRGB, HSV, HVI) yielding impressive
results. Recent efforts have sought to leverage the complementary strengths of
these paradigms, offering promising solutions to enhance performance across
varying degradation scenarios. However, existing fusion strategies are hindered
by challenges such as parameter explosion, optimization instability, and
feature misalignment, limiting further improvements. To overcome these issues,
we introduce FusionNet, a novel multi-model linear fusion framework that
operates in parallel to effectively capture global and local features across
diverse color spaces. By incorporating a linear fusion strategy underpinned by
Hilbert space theoretical guarantees, FusionNet mitigates network collapse and
reduces excessive training costs. Our method achieved 1st place in the CVPR2025
NTIRE Low Light Enhancement Challenge. Extensive experiments conducted on
synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative results, delivering robust enhancement under
diverse low-light conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，现有方法在低对比度、形态变异和小血管分割方面存在挑战，因此需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出MGFA-Net，包含心肌区域引导模块、残差特征提取编码模块和多尺度特征融合模块，并采用蒙特卡洛dropout量化预测不确定性。

Result: MGFA-Net在Dice分数（85.04%）、准确率（84.24%）和HD95（6.1294 mm）上表现优异，狭窄检测真阳性率比3D U-Net提高5.46%。

Conclusion: MGFA-Net结合深度学习和解剖学先验知识，为CAD评估提供了自动化且临床可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide,
requiring accurate segmentation and stenosis detection using Coronary Computed
Tomography angiography (CCTA). Existing methods struggle with challenges such
as low contrast, morphological variability and small vessel segmentation. To
address these limitations, we propose the Myocardial Region-guided Feature
Aggregation Net, a novel U-shaped dual-encoder architecture that integrates
anatomical prior knowledge to enhance robustness in coronary artery
segmentation. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a
Myocardial Region-guided Module that directs attention to coronary regions via
myocardial contour expansion and multi-scale feature fusion, (2) a Residual
Feature Extraction Encoding Module that combines parallel spatial channel
attention with residual blocks to enhance local-global feature discrimination,
and (3) a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module for adaptive aggregation of
hierarchical vascular features. Additionally, Monte Carlo dropout f quantifies
prediction uncertainty, supporting clinical interpretability. For stenosis
detection, a morphology-based centerline extraction algorithm separates the
vascular tree into anatomical branches, enabling cross-sectional area
quantification and stenosis grading. The superiority of MGFA-Net was
demonstrated by achieving an Dice score of 85.04%, an accuracy of 84.24%, an
HD95 of 6.1294 mm, and an improvement of 5.46% in true positive rate for
stenosis detection compared to3D U-Net. The integrated segmentation-to-stenosis
pipeline provides automated, clinically interpretable CAD assessment, bridging
deep learning with anatomical prior knowledge for precision medicine. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer模型的数据和参数规模扩大，性能提升逐渐减少，而训练成本增加，尤其是在多模态学习中，推理成本成为实际可行性的关键。因此，需要更高效的微调和推理方法。

Method: 受预训练模型深层隐式对齐特性的启发，提出了一种简单的多模态框架改进方法。

Result: 该方法在保持或提升基线性能的同时，显著减少了训练和推理时的计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为多模态学习提供了高效解决方案，还为将预训练模型组合成更大系统提供了启示。

Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in Transformer-based models is
yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against
training costs. Such plateauing indicates the importance of methods for more
efficient finetuning and inference, while retaining similar performance. This
is especially relevant for multimodal learning paradigms, where inference costs
of processing multimodal tokens can determine the model's practical viability.
At the same time, research on representations and mechanistic interpretability
has improved our understanding of the inner workings of Transformer-based
models; one such line of work reveals an implicit alignment in the deeper
layers of pretrained models, across modalities. Taking inspiration from this,
we motivate and propose a simple modification to existing multimodal frameworks
that rely on aligning pretrained models. We demonstrate that our approach
maintains and, in some cases, even improves performance of baseline methods
while achieving significant gains in both training and inference-time compute.
Our work also has implications for combining pretrained models into larger
systems efficiently.

Method: 使用视频采集系统捕捉行清洁器操作后的沟槽状况，开发分割模型分析土壤、秸秆和机械等关键元素，并量化行清洁器性能。

Result: 该方法能有效比较不同行清洁器的性能，为精准农业中的行清洁器选择和播种效率提升提供支持。

Conclusion: 基于计算机视觉的方法为行清洁器性能评估提供了客观工具，有助于优化精准农业中的播种过程。

Abstract: Effective seed sowing in precision agriculture is hindered by challenges such
as residue accumulation, low soil temperatures, and hair pinning (crop residue
pushed in the trench by furrow opener), which obstruct optimal trench
formation. Row cleaners are employed to mitigate these issues, but there is a
lack of quantitative methods to assess trench cleanliness. In this study, a
novel computer vision-based method was developed to evaluate row cleaner
performance. Multiple air seeders were equipped with a video acquisition system
to capture trench conditions after row cleaner operation, enabling an effective
comparison of the performance of each row cleaner. The captured data were used
to develop a segmentation model that analyzed key elements such as soil, straw,
and machinery. Using the results from the segmentation model, an objective
method was developed to quantify row cleaner performance. The results
demonstrated the potential of this method to improve row cleaner selection and
enhance seeding efficiency in precision agriculture.

Motivation: 肺结节是肺癌的早期指标，现有XAI系统在有限标注数据下难以提供清晰解释，MERA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MERA结合自监督学习和Vision Transformer进行无监督特征提取，利用半监督主动学习在潜在空间中进行分层预测。

Abstract: Lung cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, emphasises
the importance of early detection for better patient outcomes. Pulmonary
nodules, often early indicators of lung cancer, necessitate accurate, timely
diagnosis. Despite Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) advances, many
existing systems struggle providing clear, comprehensive explanations,
especially with limited labelled data. This study introduces MERA, a Multimodal
and Multiscale self-Explanatory model designed for lung nodule diagnosis with
considerably Reduced Annotation requirements. MERA integrates unsupervised and
weakly supervised learning strategies (self-supervised learning techniques and
Vision Transformer architecture for unsupervised feature extraction) and a
hierarchical prediction mechanism leveraging sparse annotations via
semi-supervised active learning in the learned latent space. MERA explains its
decisions on multiple levels: model-level global explanations via semantic
latent space clustering, instance-level case-based explanations showing similar
instances, local visual explanations via attention maps, and concept
explanations using critical nodule attributes. Evaluations on the public LIDC
dataset show MERA's superior diagnostic accuracy and self-explainability. With
only 1% annotated samples, MERA achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to or
exceeding state-of-the-art methods requiring full annotation. The model's
inherent design delivers comprehensive, robust, multilevel explanations aligned
closely with clinical practice, enhancing trustworthiness and transparency.
Demonstrated viability of unsupervised and weakly supervised learning lowers
the barrier to deploying diagnostic AI in broader medical domains. Our complete

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了公平性，同时保持了全局准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计公平的人脸识别系统提供了一种有效且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The urging societal demand for fair AI systems has put pressure on the
research community to develop predictive models that are not only globally
accurate but also meet new fairness criteria, reflecting the lack of disparate
mistreatment with respect to sensitive attributes ($\textit{e.g.}$ gender,
ethnicity, age). In particular, the variability of the errors made by certain
Facial Recognition (FR) systems across specific segments of the population
compromises the deployment of the latter, and was judged unacceptable by
regulatory authorities. Designing fair FR systems is a very challenging
problem, mainly due to the complex and functional nature of the performance
measure used in this domain ($\textit{i.e.}$ ROC curves) and because of the
huge heterogeneity of the face image datasets usually available for training.
In this paper, we propose a novel post-processing approach to improve the
fairness of pre-trained FR models by optimizing a regression loss which acts on
centroid-based scores. Beyond the computational advantages of the method, we
present numerical experiments providing strong empirical evidence of the gain
in fairness and of the ability to preserve global accuracy.

TL;DR: HumMorph是一种新颖的自由视角动态人体渲染方法，支持显式姿态控制，仅需少量输入视图即可生成高质量渲染结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在单视图或少量输入视图下渲染质量不足的问题，并适应更实际的噪声姿态估计场景。

Method: 通过构建粗粒度T姿态表示并结合细粒度像素对齐特征，实现快速推理和高分辨率渲染。

Result: 在单视图和双视图输入下表现优异，对噪声姿态参数更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HumMorph在自由视角人体渲染中显著优于现有方法，尤其在噪声参数下表现突出。

Abstract: We introduce HumMorph, a novel generalized approach to free-viewpoint
rendering of dynamic human bodies with explicit pose control. HumMorph renders
a human actor in any specified pose given a few observed views (starting from
just one) in arbitrary poses. Our method enables fast inference as it relies
only on feed-forward passes through the model. We first construct a coarse
representation of the actor in the canonical T-pose, which combines visual
features from individual partial observations and fills missing information
using learned prior knowledge. The coarse representation is complemented by
fine-grained pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the observed views,
which provide high-resolution appearance information. We show that HumMorph is
competitive with the state-of-the-art when only a single input view is
available, however, we achieve results with significantly better visual quality
given just 2 monocular observations. Moreover, previous generalized methods
assume access to accurate body shape and pose parameters obtained using
synchronized multi-camera setups. In contrast, we consider a more practical
scenario where these body parameters are noisily estimated directly from the
observed views. Our experimental results demonstrate that our architecture is
more robust to errors in the noisy parameters and clearly outperforms the state
of the art in this setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态匹配方法在动态手术场景中存在局限性，如视角变化、器械遮挡和组织变形，需要一种更稳定的导航系统。

Method: 系统将Atkinson-Shiffrin记忆模型的三级架构（感觉记忆、工作记忆和长期记忆）集成到动态视频序列跟踪中，无需额外硬件即可实时运行。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了传统静态方法的限制，为提升ACL重建手术精度提供了新技术支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic arthroscopic navigation system based on
multi-level memory architecture for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
reconstruction surgery. The system extends our previously proposed markerless
navigation method from static image matching to dynamic video sequence
tracking. By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level
architecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system
maintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical
procedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations
involving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation.
Unlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard
arthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware,
achieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold
improvement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000
frames), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels,
compared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of
approximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short
sequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19
percent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate
the system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods,
providing new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL
reconstruction.

Abstract: While the availability of open 3D medical shape datasets is increasing,
offering substantial benefits to the research community, we have found that
many of these datasets are, unfortunately, disorganized and contain artifacts.
These issues limit the development and training of robust models, particularly
for accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. In this paper, we examine the current
state of available 3D liver shape datasets and propose a solution using
diffusion models combined with implicit neural representations (INRs) to
augment and expand existing datasets. Our approach utilizes the generative
capabilities of diffusion models to create realistic, diverse 3D liver shapes,
capturing a wide range of anatomical variations and addressing the problem of
data scarcity. Experimental results indicate that our method enhances dataset
diversity, providing a scalable solution to improve the accuracy and
reliability of 3D liver reconstruction and generation in medical applications.
Finally, we suggest that diffusion models can also be applied to other
downstream tasks in 3D medical imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其多头注意力机制的可解释性较差，现有方法难以区分不同头的贡献。

Method: GMAR利用梯度评分量化每个头的贡献，并通过归一化加权聚合注意力分数。

Result: 实验表明，GMAR优于传统注意力展开方法，能更精确地解释ViT的预测过程。

Conclusion: GMAR为ViT模型提供了一种增强可解释性的实用框架。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has made significant advancements in computer
vision, utilizing self-attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art
performance across various tasks, including image classification, object
detection, and segmentation. Its architectural flexibility and capabilities
have made it a preferred choice among researchers and practitioners. However,
the intricate multi-head attention mechanism of ViT presents significant
challenges to interpretability, as the underlying prediction process remains
opaque. A critical limitation arises from an observation commonly noted in
transformer architectures: "Not all attention heads are equally meaningful."
Overlooking the relative importance of specific heads highlights the
limitations of existing interpretability methods. To address these challenges,
we introduce Gradient-Driven Multi-Head Attention Rollout (GMAR), a novel
method that quantifies the importance of each attention head using
gradient-based scores. These scores are normalized to derive a weighted
aggregate attention score, effectively capturing the relative contributions of
individual heads. GMAR clarifies the role of each head in the prediction
process, enabling more precise interpretability at the head level. Experimental
results demonstrate that GMAR consistently outperforms traditional attention
rollout techniques. This work provides a practical contribution to
transformer-based architectures, establishing a robust framework for enhancing
the interpretability of Vision Transformer models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原方法在处理事件切片时计算复杂度高，无法满足实时需求。

Conclusion: 优化后的方法显著提升了计算效率，支持实时应用，并开源了实现代码。

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time, asynchronous, event-based normal flow
estimator. It follows the same algorithm as Learning Normal Flow Directly From
Event Neighborhoods, but with a more optimized implementation. The original
method treats event slices as 3D point clouds, encodes each event's local
geometry into a fixed-length vector, and uses a multi-layer perceptron to
predict normal flow. It constructs representations by multiplying an adjacency
matrix with a feature matrix, resulting in quadratic time complexity with
respect to the number of events. In contrast, we leverage the fact that event
coordinates are integers and reformulate the representation step as a pooling
operation. This achieves the same effect as the adjacency matrix but with much
lower computational cost. As a result, our method supports real-time normal
flow prediction on event cameras. Our estimator uses 1 GB of CUDA memory and
runs at 4 million normal flows per second on an RTX 3070, or 6 million per
second on an RTX A5000. We release the CUDA implementation along with a Python
interface at https://github.com/dhyuan99/VecKM_flow_cpp.

Result: 在CNSatMap和纽约数据集上的实验表明，EarthMapper在视觉真实性、语义一致性和结构保真度上显著优于现有方法，并在零样本任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EarthMapper通过创新的框架和机制，成功解决了双向翻译的复杂性问题，展示了其在遥感应用中的广泛潜力。

Abstract: Satellite imagery and maps, as two fundamental data modalities in remote
sensing, offer direct observations of the Earth's surface and
human-interpretable geographic abstractions, respectively. The task of
bidirectional translation between satellite images and maps (BSMT) holds
significant potential for applications in urban planning and disaster response.
However, this task presents two major challenges: first, the absence of precise
pixel-wise alignment between the two modalities substantially complicates the
translation process; second, it requires achieving both high-level abstraction
of geographic features and high-quality visual synthesis, which further
elevates the technical complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce
EarthMapper, a novel autoregressive framework for controllable bidirectional
satellite-map translation. EarthMapper employs geographic coordinate embeddings
to anchor generation, ensuring region-specific adaptability, and leverages
multi-scale feature alignment within a geo-conditioned joint scale
autoregression (GJSA) process to unify bidirectional translation in a single
training cycle. A semantic infusion (SI) mechanism is introduced to enhance
feature-level consistency, while a key point adaptive guidance (KPAG) mechanism
is proposed to dynamically balance diversity and precision during inference. We
further contribute CNSatMap, a large-scale dataset comprising 302,132 precisely
aligned satellite-map pairs across 38 Chinese cities, enabling robust
benchmarking. Extensive experiments on CNSatMap and the New York dataset
demonstrate EarthMapper's superior performance, achieving significant
improvements in visual realism, semantic consistency, and structural fidelity
over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, EarthMapper excels in zero-shot
tasks like in-painting, out-painting and coordinate-conditional generation,
underscoring its versatility.

Conclusion: 该研究为数据驱动的医学预测提供了新方向，不仅提高了细粒度诊断的可靠性，还探索了多模态方法在医学图像分析中的应用。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a universal chronic musculoskeletal disorders
worldwide, making early diagnosis crucial. Currently, the Kellgren and Lawrence
(KL) grading system is widely used to assess KOA severity. However, its high
inter-observer variability and subjectivity hinder diagnostic consistency. To
address these limitations, automated diagnostic techniques using deep learning
have been actively explored in recent years. In this study, we propose a
CLIP-based framework (CLIP-KOA) to enhance the consistency and reliability of
KOA grade prediction. To achieve this, we introduce a learning approach that
integrates image and text information and incorporate Symmetry Loss and
Consistency Loss to ensure prediction consistency between the original and
flipped images. CLIP-KOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 71.86\% on KOA
severity prediction task, and ablation studies show that CLIP-KOA has 2.36\%
improvement in accuracy over the standard CLIP model due to our contribution.
This study shows a novel direction for data-driven medical prediction not only
to improve reliability of fine-grained diagnosis and but also to explore
multimodal methods for medical image analysis. Our code is available at

*Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Masked Language Prompting (MLP)的新方法，通过掩码部分词语并利用大语言模型生成多样且语义连贯的提示，以解决时尚风格识别数据集的构建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚风格识别数据集的构建存在主观性和模糊性挑战，现有基于类别名或参考描述的方法难以平衡视觉多样性和风格一致性。

Method: 采用MLP策略，掩码参考描述中的部分词语，利用大语言模型生成多样且语义连贯的补全，从而生成风格一致且多样的图像。

Result: 在FashionStyle14数据集上的实验表明，MLP方法优于基于类别名和描述的基线方法。

Conclusion: MLP方法在有限监督下有效提升了时尚风格识别的性能。

Abstract: Constructing dataset for fashion style recognition is challenging due to the
inherent subjectivity and ambiguity of style concepts. Recent advances in
text-to-image models have facilitated generative data augmentation by
synthesizing images from labeled data, yet existing methods based solely on
class names or reference captions often fail to balance visual diversity and
style consistency. In this work, we propose \textbf{Masked Language Prompting
(MLP)}, a novel prompting strategy that masks selected words in a reference
caption and leverages large language models to generate diverse yet
semantically coherent completions. This approach preserves the structural
semantics of the original caption while introducing attribute-level variations
aligned with the intended style, enabling style-consistent and diverse image
generation without fine-tuning. Experimental results on the FashionStyle14
dataset demonstrate that our MLP-based augmentation consistently outperforms
class-name and caption-based baselines, validating its effectiveness for
fashion style recognition under limited supervision.

Motivation: 传统方法使用边界框确定3D物体位置和尺寸，但立方体作为替代方案更简洁有效。

Method: 采用自回归模型逐步排列立方体，并通过拒绝采样过滤碰撞场景。

Result: 在3D-FRONT和3DFRONT-NC数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升了场景真实感。

Conclusion: CasaGPT为3D场景合成提供了高效且高质量的新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for indoor scene synthesis, which learns to
arrange decomposed cuboid primitives to represent 3D objects within a scene.
Unlike conventional methods that use bounding boxes to determine the placement
and scale of 3D objects, our approach leverages cuboids as a straightforward
yet highly effective alternative for modeling objects. This allows for compact
scene generation while minimizing object intersections. Our approach, coined
CasaGPT for Cuboid Arrangement and Scene Assembly, employs an autoregressive
model to sequentially arrange cuboids, producing physically plausible scenes.
By applying rejection sampling during the fine-tuning stage to filter out
scenes with object collisions, our model further reduces intersections and
enhances scene quality. Additionally, we introduce a refined dataset,
3DFRONT-NC, which eliminates significant noise presented in the original
dataset, 3D-FRONT. Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset as well as our
dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the realism of generated scenes, and
providing a promising direction for 3D scene synthesis.

Conclusion: SynergyAmodal框架有效解决了数据稀缺问题，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Image deocclusion (or amodal completion) aims to recover the invisible
regions (\ie, shape and appearance) of occluded instances in images. Despite
recent advances, the scarcity of high-quality data that balances diversity,
plausibility, and fidelity remains a major obstacle. To address this challenge,
we identify three critical elements: leveraging in-the-wild image data for
diversity, incorporating human expertise for plausibility, and utilizing
generative priors for fidelity. We propose SynergyAmodal, a novel framework for
co-synthesizing in-the-wild amodal datasets with comprehensive shape and
appearance annotations, which integrates these elements through a tripartite
data-human-model collaboration. First, we design an occlusion-grounded
self-supervised learning algorithm to harness the diversity of in-the-wild
image data, fine-tuning an inpainting diffusion model into a partial completion
diffusion model. Second, we establish a co-synthesis pipeline to iteratively
filter, refine, select, and annotate the initial deocclusion results of the
partial completion diffusion model, ensuring plausibility and fidelity through
human expert guidance and prior model constraints. This pipeline generates a
high-quality paired amodal dataset with extensive category and scale diversity,
comprising approximately 16K pairs. Finally, we train a full completion
diffusion model on the synthesized dataset, incorporating text prompts as
conditioning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework in achieving zero-shot generalization and textual
controllability. Our code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available
at https://github.com/imlixinyang/SynergyAmodal.

Motivation: 现有花样滑冰数据集多关注单一任务（如动作识别或评分），缺乏对技术和艺术的全面标注，且体育研究多集中于球类运动，艺术体育研究有限。

Method: 提出FSAnno数据集和FSBench基准，包括FSBench-Text（选择题和解释）和FSBench-Motion（多模态数据和QA对），支持从技术分析到表演评论的任务。

Result: 初步测试显示现有模型对艺术体育的理解存在显著局限。

Conclusion: FSBench有望成为评估和提升模型对花样滑冰理解的关键工具。

Abstract: Figure skating, known as the "Art on Ice," is among the most artistic sports,
challenging to understand due to its blend of technical elements (like jumps
and spins) and overall artistic expression. Existing figure skating datasets
mainly focus on single tasks, such as action recognition or scoring, lacking
comprehensive annotations for both technical and artistic evaluation. Current
sports research is largely centered on ball games, with limited relevance to
artistic sports like figure skating. To address this, we introduce FSAnno, a
large-scale dataset advancing artistic sports understanding through figure
skating. FSAnno includes an open-access training and test dataset, alongside a
benchmark dataset, FSBench, for fair model evaluation. FSBench consists of
FSBench-Text, with multiple-choice questions and explanations, and
FSBench-Motion, containing multimodal data and Question and Answer (QA) pairs,
supporting tasks from technical analysis to performance commentary. Initial
tests on FSBench reveal significant limitations in existing models'
understanding of artistic sports. We hope FSBench will become a key tool for
evaluating and enhancing model comprehension of figure skating.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法依赖大数据集和掩码标注，成本高且难以扩展。现有VLMs和MLLMs虽有所改进，但仍需掩码标注，且工业数据集存在严重类别不平衡问题。

Method: 采用动态奖励函数优化训练过程，优先处理罕见缺陷模式；提出基于CoT和GRPO的无掩码推理框架，直接从原始图像检测异常。

Conclusion: 该方法无需掩码标注，降低成本并提供可解释输出，推动了工业异常检测的发展，支持制造业的可扩展质量控制。

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for ensuring product quality
by identifying defects. Traditional methods such as feature embedding and
reconstruction-based approaches require large datasets and struggle with
scalability. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) address some limitations but rely on mask annotations,
leading to high implementation costs and false positives. Additionally,
industrial datasets like MVTec-AD and VisA suffer from severe class imbalance,
with defect samples constituting only 23.8% and 11.1% of total data
respectively. To address these challenges, we propose a reward function that
dynamically prioritizes rare defect patterns during training to handle class
imbalance. We also introduce a mask-free reasoning framework using Chain of
Thought (CoT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) mechanisms,
enabling anomaly detection directly from raw images without annotated masks.
This approach generates interpretable step-by-step explanations for defect
localization. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
prior approaches by 36% in accuracy on MVTec-AD and 16% on VisA. By eliminating
mask dependency and reducing costs while providing explainable outputs, this
work advances industrial anomaly detection and supports scalable quality
control in manufacturing. Code to reproduce the experiment is available at

Result: ASW在已知和未知失真上均表现优异，尤其对未知失真更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ASW是一种高效、无需训练的水印方法，对未知失真具有显著鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in digital watermarking make use of deep neural networks for
message embedding and extraction. They typically follow the ``encoder-noise
layer-decoder''-based architecture. By deliberately establishing a
differentiable noise layer to simulate the distortion of the watermarked
signal, they jointly train the deep encoder and decoder to fit the noise layer
to guarantee robustness. As a result, they are usually weak against unknown
distortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we
propose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely
Adversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW). ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder
that is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions
for watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the
shallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated
version (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to
output the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately
recovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive
nature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is
training-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that
the watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various
unknown distortions. Compared to the existing ``encoder-noise layer-decoder''
approaches, ASW achieves comparable results on known distortions and better
robustness on unknown distortions.

Result: 实验表明，Point2Quad在清晰和噪声数据上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Point2Quad为四边形网格生成提供了一种有效的学习框架。

Abstract: Quad meshes are essential in geometric modeling and computational mechanics.
Although learning-based methods for triangle mesh demonstrate considerable
advancements, quad mesh generation remains less explored due to the challenge
of ensuring coplanarity, convexity, and quad-only meshes. In this paper, we
present Point2Quad, the first learning-based method for quad-only mesh
generation from point clouds. The key idea is learning to identify quad mesh
with fused pointwise and facewise features. Specifically, Point2Quad begins
with a k-NN-based candidate generation considering the coplanarity and
squareness. Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and
topological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints,
especially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics.
Subsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a
designed compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a
quad-specific post-processing. Extensive experiments on both clear and noise
data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of Point2Quad, compared to
baseline methods under comprehensive metrics.

Result: CrowdSat-Net在实验中表现最佳，F1-score和Precision分别达到66.12%和73.23%。

Conclusion: 研究通过新网络架构和数据集推动了群体检测的发展。

Abstract: Accurate crowd detection (CD) is critical for public safety and historical
pattern analysis, yet existing methods relying on ground and aerial imagery
suffer from limited spatio-temporal coverage. The development of
very-fine-resolution (VFR) satellite sensor imagery (e.g., ~0.3 m spatial
resolution) provides unprecedented opportunities for large-scale crowd activity
analysis, but it has never been considered for this task. To address this gap,
we proposed CrowdSat-Net, a novel point-based convolutional neural network,
which features two innovative components: Dual-Context Progressive Attention
Network (DCPAN) to improve feature representation of individuals by aggregating
scene context and local individual characteristics, and High-Frequency Guided
Deformable Upsampler (HFGDU) that recovers high-frequency information during
upsampling through frequency-domain guided deformable convolutions. To validate
the effectiveness of CrowdSat-Net, we developed CrowdSat, the first VFR
satellite imagery dataset designed specifically for CD tasks, comprising over
120k manually labeled individuals from multi-source satellite platforms
(Beijing-3N, Jilin-1 Gaofen-04A and Google Earth) across China. In the
experiments, CrowdSat-Net was compared with five state-of-the-art point-based
CD methods (originally designed for ground or aerial imagery) using CrowdSat
and achieved the largest F1-score of 66.12% and Precision of 73.23%, surpassing
the second-best method by 1.71% and 2.42%, respectively. Moreover, extensive
ablation experiments validated the importance of the DCPAN and HFGDU modules.
Furthermore, cross-regional evaluation further demonstrated the spatial
generalizability of CrowdSat-Net. This research advances CD capability by
providing both a newly developed network architecture for CD and a pioneering
benchmark dataset to facilitate future CD development.

Abstract: Emotion understanding is a critical yet challenging task. Most existing
approaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial
expressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To
address this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and
Reasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using
de-identified video and audio inputs. The DEEMO dataset consists of two
subsets: DEEMO-NFBL, which includes rich annotations of Non-Facial Body

Recognition and Reasoning using identity-free cues. This design supports
emotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we
propose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates
de-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion
recognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a
significant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in
de-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap

Abstract: Current point-based approaches encounter limitations in scalability and
rendering quality when using large 3D point cloud maps because using them
directly for novel view synthesis (NVS) leads to degraded visualizations. We
identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility
mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two
modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new
approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving
scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two
modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds
(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance
and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed
from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging
this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and
enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from
the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with
the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these
descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and
point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer
network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them
and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our
proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits
for improved rendering and scalability.

Result: 提出了弥合类别级与开放集姿态估计差距的方法，并提供了可操作的建议。

Conclusion: 通过综合比较和分析，本文为提升6D姿态估计的泛化能力提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Object pose estimation enables a variety of tasks in computer vision and
robotics, including scene understanding and robotic grasping. The complexity of
a pose estimation task depends on the unknown variables related to the target
object. While instance-level methods already excel for opaque and Lambertian
objects, category-level and open-set methods, where texture, shape, and size
are partially or entirely unknown, still struggle with these basic material
properties. Since texture is unknown in these scenarios, it cannot be used for
disambiguating object symmetries, another core challenge of 6D object pose
estimation. The complexity of estimating 6D poses with such a manifold of
unknowns led to various datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithmic solutions.
This paper compares datasets, accuracy metrics, and algorithms for solving 6D
pose estimation on the category-level. Based on this comparison, we analyze how
to bridge category-level and open-set object pose estimation to reach
generalization and provide actionable recommendations.

Conclusion: DG-DETR为DETRs的领域泛化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have demonstrated strong
detection performance. However, domain generalization (DG) research has
primarily focused on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors, while
paying little attention to enhancing the robustness of DETRs. In this letter,
we introduce a Domain Generalized DEtection TRansformer (DG-DETR), a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play method that improves out-of-distribution (OOD)
robustness for DETRs. Specifically, we propose a novel domain-agnostic query
selection strategy that removes domain-induced biases from object queries via
orthogonal projection onto the instance-specific style space. Additionally, we
leverage a wavelet decomposition to disentangle features into domain-invariant
and domain-specific components, enabling synthesis of diverse latent styles
while preserving the semantic features of objects. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of DG-DETR. Our code is available at
https://github.com/sminhwang/DG-DETR.

Motivation: 点云采样在3D计算机视觉中至关重要，但现有学习采样方法存在采样模式不可识别或结果偏斜的问题，且未考虑形状间的分布差异。

Method: 提出SAMBLE方法，结合稀疏注意力图和分箱学习，学习形状特定的采样策略。

Result: SAMBLE在多个下游任务中表现优异，即使在少点采样场景下也能保持性能。

Conclusion: SAMBLE通过形状特定策略，显著提升了点云采样的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for accurate and efficient representation of
3D data in various domains, point cloud sampling has emerged as a pivotal
research topic in 3D computer vision. Recently, learning-to-sample methods have
garnered growing interest from the community, particularly for their ability to
be jointly trained with downstream tasks. However, previous learning-based
sampling methods either lead to unrecognizable sampling patterns by generating
a new point cloud or biased sampled results by focusing excessively on sharp
edge details. Moreover, they all overlook the natural variations in point
distribution across different shapes, applying a similar sampling strategy to
all point clouds. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Attention Map and
Bin-based Learning method (termed SAMBLE) to learn shape-specific sampling
strategies for point cloud shapes. SAMBLE effectively achieves an improved
balance between sampling edge points for local details and preserving
uniformity in the global shape, resulting in superior performance across
multiple common point cloud downstream tasks, even in scenarios with few-point
sampling.

*Sangmin Kim,Seunguk Do,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowMak3r是一个动态辐射场重建管道，用于从视频片段（如电视剧）中重建和编辑场景，解决了演员遮挡、杂乱舞台和小基线视图等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从娱乐视频（如电视剧）中重建动态辐射场具有挑战性，主要由于演员遮挡、多样面部表情、杂乱舞台和突然镜头切换。

Method: ShowMak3r包括3DLocator模块（定位演员并估计未见过的人体姿态）、ShotMatcher模块（跟踪镜头切换下的演员）和面部拟合网络（动态恢复表情）。

Result: 在Sitcoms3D数据集上，ShowMak3r能够重新组装场景并支持新相机视角，还展示了合成镜头制作、演员重定位等应用。

Conclusion: ShowMak3r为动态辐射场重建提供了全面的解决方案，支持场景编辑和多种有趣应用。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic radiance fields from video clips is challenging,
especially when entertainment videos like TV shows are given. Many challenges
make the reconstruction difficult due to (1) actors occluding with each other
and having diverse facial expressions, (2) cluttered stages, and (3) small
baseline views or sudden shot changes. To address these issues, we present
ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of
scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In
ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth
prior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation. The proposed
ShotMatcher module then tracks the actors under shot changes. Furthermore,
ShowMak3r introduces a face-fitting network that dynamically recovers the
actors' expressions. Experiments on Sitcoms3D dataset show that our pipeline
can reassemble TV show scenes with new cameras at different timestamps. We also
demonstrate that ShowMak3r enables interesting applications such as synthetic
shot-making, actor relocation, insertion, deletion, and pose manipulation.

### [151] [Magnifier: A Multi-grained Neural Network-based Architecture for Burned Area Delineation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19589)
*Daniele Rege Cambrin,Luca Colomba,Paolo Garza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Magnifier的新方法，通过双编码器（局部和全局）在有限数据下提升图像分割性能，平均IoU提高2.65%，且计算开销较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在危机管理和遥感中，图像分割对灾难响应至关重要，但数据稀缺和缺乏基准数据集限制了大型神经网络的训练能力。

Method: Magnifier通过双编码器（局部和全局）对输入数据在不同粒度下分析，扩展现有编码器-解码器架构，提升信息提取能力。

Result: 在相同输入图像下，Magnifier平均IoU提高2.65%，计算开销（GFLOPs）仅为现有方法的一半以下。

Conclusion: Magnifier在数据有限的情况下显著提升分割性能，适用于现有架构，计算效率高。

Abstract: In crisis management and remote sensing, image segmentation plays a crucial
role, enabling tasks like disaster response and emergency planning by analyzing
visual data. Neural networks are able to analyze satellite acquisitions and
determine which areas were affected by a catastrophic event. The problem in
their development in this context is the data scarcity and the lack of
extensive benchmark datasets, limiting the capabilities of training large
neural network models. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, namely
Magnifier, to improve segmentation performance with limited data availability.
The Magnifier methodology is applicable to any existing encoder-decoder
architecture, as it extends a model by merging information at different
contextual levels through a dual-encoder approach: a local and global encoder.
Magnifier analyzes the input data twice using the dual-encoder approach. In
particular, the local and global encoders extract information from the same
input at different granularities. This allows Magnifier to extract more
information than the other approaches given the same set of input images.
Magnifier improves the quality of the results of +2.65% on average IoU while
leading to a restrained increase in terms of the number of trainable parameters
compared to the original model. We evaluated our proposed approach with
state-of-the-art burned area segmentation models, demonstrating, on average,
comparable or better performances in less than half of the GFLOPs.

Result: 实验证明专业化能提升通用网络的准确性，且分析了特征空间的演变。

Conclusion: 研究为开发动态可配置图像分析系统奠定基础，并有助于在特定数据域被排除时提升系统性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a concept of neural network specialization via
task-specific domain constraining, aimed at enhancing network performance on
data subspace in which the network operates. The study presents experiments on
training specialists for image classification and object detection tasks. The
results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy
even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by
constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and
experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying
traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically
coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is
proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the
evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to
future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image
analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input.
Additionally, the proposed methods can help improve system performance in
scenarios where certain data domains should be excluded from consideration of
the generalist network.

### [153] [Lightweight Adapter Learning for More Generalized Remote Sensing Change Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19598)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的变化检测网络（CANet），通过共享和特定数据集模块解决现有方法泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在遥感图像变化检测中泛化能力不足，无法适应不同数据集的数据分布和标注差异。

Method: CANet包含共享和特定数据集模块，设计了轻量级适配器和变化区域掩码（ICM），并采用独特批归一化层处理数据分布差异。

Result: CANet在多个数据集上表现优异，泛化能力强，训练成本低（仅更新4.1%-7.7%参数），且在有限训练数据下性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: CANet是一种高效、通用的变化检测方法，可灵活嵌入现有深度模型。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have shown promising performances in remote sensing
image change detection (CD). However, existing methods usually train a
dataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant
differences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the
trained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on
other datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter
network (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains
dataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the
discriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter
model, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data
distribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the
deep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this
paper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which
can adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of
labeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch
normalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution
differences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve
satisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental
results on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and
advantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization
ability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and
better performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning
methods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.

TL;DR: HDM通过结合二维热方程的离散形式，改进了DDPM的图像生成质量，生成更真实的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDPM虽然能生成高质量图像，但未充分利用像素间的局部关系，HDM旨在通过像素级操作优化细节。

Method: HDM在DDPM的基础上，将二维热方程离散形式融入扩散和生成公式，计算相邻像素关系。

Result: 实验显示HDM生成的图像质量优于DDPM、CDM、LDM和VQGAN等模型。

Conclusion: HDM通过局部像素关系处理，显著提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) achieve high-quality image
generation without adversarial training, but they process images as a whole.
Since adjacent pixels are highly likely to belong to the same object, we
propose the Heat Diffusion Model (HDM) to further preserve image details and
generate more realistic images. HDM is a model that incorporates pixel-level
operations while maintaining the same training process as DDPM. In HDM, the
discrete form of the two-dimensional heat equation is integrated into the
diffusion and generation formulas of DDPM, enabling the model to compute
relationships between neighboring pixels during image processing. Our
experiments demonstrate that HDM can generate higher-quality samples compared
to models such as DDPM, Consistency Diffusion Models (CDM), Latent Diffusion
Models (LDM), and Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQGAN).

TL;DR: DiVE是一个基于扩散变换器的生成框架，用于生成高质量、时空一致的多视角驾驶场景视频，解决了现有方法的质量和一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视角驾驶场景视频采集成本高且困难，现有生成模型质量差且一致性不足，限制了其在感知任务中的应用。

Method: DiVE采用扩散变换器框架，结合统一的跨注意力和SketchFormer控制多模态数据，引入无额外参数的视图膨胀注意力机制保证多视角一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，DiVE实现了最先进的性能，生成的照片级视频具有出色的时间和跨视角一致性。

Conclusion: DiVE通过创新方法解决了多条件输入和高分辨率渲染的挑战，显著提升了生成视频的质量和效率。

Abstract: Collecting multi-view driving scenario videos to enhance the performance of
3D visual perception tasks presents significant challenges and incurs
substantial costs, making generative models for realistic data an appealing
alternative. Yet, the videos generated by recent works suffer from poor quality
and spatiotemporal consistency, undermining their utility in advancing
perception tasks under driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DiVE,
a diffusion transformer-based generative framework meticulously engineered to
produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and cross-view consistent
multi-view videos, aligning seamlessly with bird's-eye view layouts and textual
descriptions. DiVE leverages a unified cross-attention and a SketchFormer to
exert precise control over multimodal data, while incorporating a view-inflated
attention mechanism that adds no extra parameters, thereby guaranteeing
consistency across views. Despite these advancements, synthesizing
high-resolution videos under multimodal constraints introduces dual challenges:
investigating the optimal classifier-free guidance coniguration under intricate
multi-condition inputs and mitigating excessive computational latency in
high-resolution rendering--both of which remain underexplored in prior
researches. To resolve these limitations, we introduce two innovations:
Multi-Control Auxiliary Branch Distillation, which streamlines multi-condition
CFG selection while circumventing high computational overhead, and Resolution
Progressive Sampling, a training-free acceleration strategy that staggers
resolution scaling to reduce high latency due to high resolution. These
innovations collectively achieve a 2.62x speedup with minimal quality
degradation. Evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, DiVE achieves SOTA performance
in multi-view video generation, yielding photorealistic outputs with
exceptional temporal and cross-view coherence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NSegment的数据增强方法，通过仅对分割标签应用弹性变换来解决遥感图像分割中的标注错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像分割数据集中存在标注错误，且标注数据稀缺，传统方法复杂且耗时。

Method: NSegment方法仅对分割标签应用弹性变换，并根据样本调整变形强度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了多种先进模型的遥感图像分割性能。

Conclusion: NSegment是一种简单有效的数据增强方案，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often
remain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels,
shadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore,
the scarcity of annotated RS data due to high image acquisition and labeling
costs complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms
such as label selection or noise correction might address this issue, they tend
to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this letter, we
propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate
this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only
to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each
training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation
on various state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的PRVR框架，通过利用跨模态双重特性（样本间相关性和样本内冗余性）提升视频检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PRVR任务中文本与视频模态间的语义不对称问题，现有方法忽略跨模态双重特性。

Method: 框架包含三个模块：ICE（样本间相关性增强）、IRM（样本内冗余挖掘）、TCP（时序一致性预测）。

Result: 在三个数据集上取得最优性能，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过系统性利用跨模态特性，显著提升了PRVR任务的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video
that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR
arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as
videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing
methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic
space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task:
inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a
novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our
framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation
Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying
semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining
them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction.
Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample
redundancy by mining redundant video moment features and treating them as hard
negative samples, thereby encouraging the model to learn more discriminative
representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal
Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances feature discrimination by
training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled
video frames and moments. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach compared to previous methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Result: BARIS-ERA在Swin-B和ConvNeXt V2骨干网络上分别超越Mask R-CNN 3.4 mAP和3.8 mAP。

Conclusion: BARIS-ERA为水下实例分割提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Underwater instance segmentation is challenging due to adverse visual
conditions such as light attenuation, scattering, and color distortion, which
degrade model performance. In this work, we propose BARIS-Decoder
(Boundary-Aware Refinement Decoder for Instance Segmentation), a framework that
enhances segmentation accuracy through feature refinement. To address
underwater degradations, we introduce the Environmental Robust Adapter (ERA),
which efficiently models underwater degradation patterns while reducing
trainable parameters by over 90\% compared to full fine-tuning. The integration
of BARIS-Decoder with ERA-tuning, referred to as BARIS-ERA, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing Mask R-CNN by 3.4 mAP with a Swin-B
backbone and 3.8 mAP with ConvNeXt V2. Our findings demonstrate the

Result: 在多个HFR和人脸识别基准测试中表现优于现有方法，同时保持低计算开销。

Conclusion: 该框架在异质和同质场景下均表现出色，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) addresses the challenge of matching face
images across different sensing modalities, such as thermal to visible or
near-infrared to visible, expanding the applicability of face recognition
systems in real-world, unconstrained environments. While recent HFR methods
have shown promising results, many rely on computation-intensive architectures,
limiting their practicality for deployment on resource-constrained edge
devices. In this work, we present a lightweight yet effective HFR framework by
adapting a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture originally designed for face
recognition. Our approach enables efficient end-to-end training with minimal
paired heterogeneous data while preserving strong performance on standard RGB
face recognition tasks. This makes it a compelling solution for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple
challenging HFR and face recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a low
computational overhead.

Result: 研究发现GNNs的决策过程可以有效解释，但其深层推理与人类感知不完全一致。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了GNNs的可解释性潜力，同时指出其深层推理与人类理解的差异，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to
convolutional approaches for vision tasks such as image classification,
leveraging patch-based representations instead of raw pixels. These methods
construct graphs where image patches serve as nodes, and edges are established
based on patch similarity or classification relevance. Despite their
efficiency, the explainability of GNN-based vision models remains
underexplored, even though graphs are naturally interpretable. In this work, we
analyze the semantic consistency of the graphs formed at different layers of
GNN-based image classifiers, focusing on how well they preserve object
structures and meaningful relationships. A comprehensive analysis is presented
by quantifying the extent to which inter-layer graph connections reflect
semantic similarity and spatial coherence. Explanations from standard and
adversarial settings are also compared to assess whether they reflect the
classifiers' robustness. Additionally, we visualize the flow of information
across layers through heatmap-based visualization techniques, thereby
highlighting the models' explainability. Our findings demonstrate that the
decision-making processes of these models can be effectively explained, while
also revealing that their reasoning does not necessarily align with human
perception, especially in deeper layers.

Motivation: 解决夜间条件下低质量交通摄像头图像天气分类的挑战。

Method: 使用CycleGAN进行域转换提升图像质量，结合SigLIP-2对比学习优化分类性能。

Result: 最佳夜间分类准确率达85.90%，整体准确率最高为97.01%。

Conclusion: 结合域适应和高效对比学习可构建实用且资源高效的天气分类系统。

Abstract: Accurate weather classification from low-quality traffic camera imagery
remains a challenging task, particularly under adverse nighttime conditions. In
this study, we propose a scalable framework that combines generative domain
adaptation with efficient contrastive learning to enhance classification
performance. Using CycleGAN-based domain translation, we improve the quality of
nighttime images, enabling better feature extraction by downstream models.
While the baseline EVA-02 model employing CLIP-based contrastive loss achieves
an overall accuracy of 96.55\%, it exhibits a significant performance gap
between daytime (97.21\%) and nighttime conditions (63.40\%). Replacing CLIP
with the lightweight SigLIP-2 (Sigmoid contrastive loss) achieves a competitive
overall accuracy of 94.00\%, with substantial improvements in nighttime
performance (85.90\% accuracy). The combination of Vision-SigLIP-2,
Text-SigLIP-2, CycleGAN, and contrastive training achieves the best nighttime
accuracy (85.90\%) among all models tested, while EVA-02 with CycleGAN
maintains the highest overall accuracy (97.01\%) and per-class accuracies.
These findings demonstrate the potential of combining domain adaptation and
efficient contrastive learning to build practical, resource-efficient weather
classification systems for intelligent transportation infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）虽减少辐射，但会降低图像质量并产生金属伪影。现有深度学习方法在多尺度信息利用和多剂量模型存储方面存在不足。

Method: 构建PMSRNet，结合多尺度稀疏框架，利用PSATG生成自适应阈值和MSFuM融合多尺度系数。提出PDuMSRNet框架，通过提示引导策略训练单一模型适应多剂量水平。

Result: 实验表明，PMSRNet和PDuMSRNet在多种剂量水平下优于现有LDMAR方法。

Conclusion: PMSRNet和PDuMSRNet有效解决了LDCT重建和金属伪影减少问题，具有多尺度信息利用和单一模型适应多剂量的优势。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) is capable of reducing X-ray radiation exposure, but it
will potentially degrade image quality, even yields metal artifacts at the case
of metallic implants. For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact
reduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main
limitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale
information; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates
significant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a
prompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network,
abbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet
inspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ
within-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an
elaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a
built multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively
capture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds,
achieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels.
Furthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework
called PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for
multiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains
dose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding
information, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings.
Extensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed
methods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays
a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug
discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain
molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through
traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a
method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike
conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt
to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting
molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using
learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups
and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that
enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against
state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior
retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The
dataset, models, and code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, herein referred to
as anomalies, is crucial for the reliable deployment of semantic segmentation
models in open-set, safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving.
Current anomalous segmentation benchmarks predominantly focus on favorable
weather conditions, resulting in untrustworthy evaluations that overlook the
risks posed by diverse meteorological conditions in open-set environments, such
as low illumination, dense fog, and heavy rain. To bridge this gap, this paper
introduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for
open-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide
spectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and
diverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in
realistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several
state-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods
demonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios,
highlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve
that, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates
the complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness
of anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a
diffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate
diverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste
training data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and
ComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer
with energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and
generalizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an
average improvement of around 4.96% in $\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in
$\rm{FPR}_{95}$.

Abstract: The increasing demand for aquaculture production necessitates the development
of innovative, intelligent tools to effectively monitor and manage fish health
and welfare. While non-invasive video monitoring has become a common practice
in finfish aquaculture, existing intelligent monitoring methods predominantly
focus on assessing body condition or fish swimming patterns and are often
developed and evaluated in controlled tank environments, without demonstrating
their applicability to real-world aquaculture settings in open sea farms. This
underscores the necessity for methods that can monitor physiological traits
directly within the production environment of sea fish farms. To this end, we
have developed a computer vision method for monitoring ventilation rates of
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which was specifically designed for videos
recorded in the production environment of commercial sea fish farms using the
existing infrastructure. Our approach uses a fish head detection model, which
classifies the mouth state as either open or closed using a convolutional
neural network. This is followed with multiple object tracking to create
temporal sequences of fish swimming across the field of view of the underwater
video camera to estimate ventilation rates. The method demonstrated high
efficiency, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 between ground
truth and predicted ventilation rates in a test set of 100 fish collected
independently of the training data. By accurately identifying pens where fish
exhibit signs of respiratory distress, our method offers broad applicability
and the potential to transform fish health and welfare monitoring in finfish
aquaculture.

Abstract: Traffic light perception is an essential component of the camera-based
perception system for autonomous vehicles, enabling accurate detection and
interpretation of traffic lights to ensure safe navigation through complex
urban environments. In this work, we propose a modularized perception framework
that integrates state-of-the-art detection models with a novel real-time
association and decision framework, enabling seamless deployment into an
autonomous driving stack. To address the limitations of existing public
datasets, we introduce the ATLAS dataset, which provides comprehensive
annotations of traffic light states and pictograms across diverse environmental
conditions and camera setups. This dataset is publicly available at
https://url.fzi.de/ATLAS. We train and evaluate several state-of-the-art
traffic light detection architectures on ATLAS, demonstrating significant
performance improvements in both accuracy and robustness. Finally, we evaluate
the framework in real-world scenarios by deploying it in an autonomous vehicle
to make decisions at traffic light-controlled intersections, highlighting its
reliability and effectiveness for real-time operation.

Conclusion: RepText在多语言文本渲染上取得显著进展，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Although contemporary text-to-image generation models have achieved
remarkable breakthroughs in producing visually appealing images, their capacity
to generate precise and flexible typographic elements, especially non-Latin
alphabets, remains constrained. To address these limitations, we start from an
naive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for
text rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present
RepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation
models with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate,
multilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really
understand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and
additionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to
enable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text
content, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text
perceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to
stabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize
with noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region
masks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid
distortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the
effectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach
outperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to
native multi-language closed-source models. To be more fair, we also
exhaustively discuss its limitations in the end.

Conclusion: 本文为无人驾驶列车系统的安全审批提供了客观且全面的数据支持。

Abstract: Points 2.1.4(b), 2.4.2(b) and 2.4.3(b) in Annex I of Implementing Regulation
(EU) No. 402/2013 allow a simplified approach for the safety approval of
computer vision systems for driverless trains, if they have 'similar' functions
and interfaces as the replaced human driver. The human driver is not replaced
one-to-one by a technical system - only a limited set of cognitive functions
are replaced. However, performance in the most challenging function, obstacle
detection, is difficult to quantify due to the deficiency of published
measurement results. This article summarizes the data published so far. This
article also goes a long way to remedy this situation by providing a new public
and anonymized dataset of 711 train driver performance measurements from
controlled experiments. The measurements are made for different speeds,
obstacle sizes, train protection systems and obstacle color contrasts
respectively. The measured values are reaction time and distance to the
obstacle. The goal of this paper is an unbiased and exhaustive description of
the presented dataset for research, standardization and regulation. Further

Abstract: Global variations in terrain appearance raise a major challenge for satellite
image analysis, leading to poor model performance when training on locations
that differ from those encountered at test time. This remains true even with
recent large global datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
domain-generalization framework for satellite images. Instead of trying to
learn a single generalizable model, we train one expert model per training
domain, while learning experts' similarity and encouraging similar experts to
be consistent. A model selection module then identifies the most suitable
experts for a given test sample and aggregates their predictions. Experiments
on four datasets (DynamicEarthNet, MUDS, OSCD, and FMoW) demonstrate consistent
gains over existing domain generalization and adaptation methods. Our code is

Abstract: The presence of species provides key insights into the ecological properties
of a location such as land cover, climatic conditions or even soil properties.
We propose a method to predict such ecological properties directly from remote
sensing (RS) images by aligning them with species habitat descriptions. We
introduce the EcoWikiRS dataset, consisting of high-resolution aerial images,
the corresponding geolocated species observations, and, for each species, the
textual descriptions of their habitat from Wikipedia. EcoWikiRS offers a
scalable way of supervision for RS vision language models (RS-VLMs) for
ecology. This is a setting with weak and noisy supervision, where, for
instance, some text may describe properties that are specific only to part of
the species' niche or is irrelevant to a specific image. We tackle this by
proposing WINCEL, a weighted version of the InfoNCE loss. We evaluate our model
on the task of ecosystem zero-shot classification by following the habitat
definitions from the European Nature Information System (EUNIS). Our results
show that our approach helps in understanding RS images in a more ecologically
meaningful manner. The code and the dataset are available at

Result: 在RayIoU和mAVE指标上表现优于现有方法，训练时GPU内存使用降至8.7GB。

Conclusion: 显式状态建模方法在3D占用和场景流预测中表现出色，同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: 3D occupancy and scene flow offer a detailed and dynamic representation of 3D
scene. Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous
vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to
model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to
capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling
method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features.
Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism,
integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D
features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we
introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which
reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy
not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for
occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage
during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB. Our code is available on

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模连续相机运动，显著提升了在挑战性场景中的性能，且无需依赖先验信息。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has demonstrated its superior capability to
represent 3D geometry but require accurately precomputed camera poses during
training. To mitigate this requirement, existing methods jointly optimize
camera poses and NeRF often relying on good pose initialisation or depth
priors. However, these approaches struggle in challenging scenarios, such as
large rotations, as they map each camera to a world coordinate system. We
propose a novel method that eliminates prior dependencies by modeling
continuous camera motions as time-dependent angular velocity and velocity.
Relative motions between cameras are learned first via velocity integration,
while camera poses can be obtained by aggregating such relative motions up to a
world coordinate system defined at a single time step within the video.
Specifically, accurate continuous camera movements are learned through a
time-dependent NeRF, which captures local scene geometry and motion by training
from neighboring frames for each time step. The learned motions enable
fine-tuning the NeRF to represent the full scene geometry. Experiments on Co3D
and Scannet show our approach achieves superior camera pose and depth
estimation and comparable novel-view synthesis performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 参数化裁剪方法显著提升对比学习的效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) approaches have gained great recognition as a very
successful subset of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. SSL enables
learning from unlabeled data, a crucial step in the advancement of deep
learning, particularly in computer vision (CV), given the plethora of unlabeled
image data. CL works by comparing different random augmentations (e.g.,
different crops) of the same image, thus achieving self-labeling. Nevertheless,
randomly augmenting images and especially random cropping can result in an
image that is semantically very distant from the original and therefore leads
to false labeling, hence undermining the efficacy of the methods. In this
research, two novel parameterized cropping methods are introduced that increase
the robustness of self-labeling and consequently increase the efficacy. The
results show that the use of these methods significantly improves the accuracy
of the model by between 2.7\% and 12.4\% on the downstream task of classifying
CIFAR-10, depending on the crop size compared to that of the non-parameterized
random cropping method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视线估计方法将所有训练样本视为同等重要，而HOIGaze通过利用眼、手和头部的协调运动，识别对训练最有用的样本，从而提高估计精度。

Method: 1) 分层框架：先识别视觉关注的手，再基于该手估计视线方向；2) 跨模态Transformer融合头部和手-物体特征；3) 眼-头部协调损失优化训练样本。

Result: 在HOT3D和ADT数据集上，HOIGaze平均分别提升15.6%和6.0%的精度，并在眼基活动识别任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 眼-手-头部协调运动包含丰富信息，为基于学习的视线估计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present HOIGaze - a novel learning-based approach for gaze estimation
during hand-object interactions (HOI) in extended reality (XR). HOIGaze
addresses the challenging HOI setting by building on one key insight: The eye,
hand, and head movements are closely coordinated during HOIs and this
coordination can be exploited to identify samples that are most useful for gaze
estimator training - as such, effectively denoising the training data. This
denoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods
that treated all training samples as equal. Specifically, we propose: 1) a
novel hierarchical framework that first recognises the hand currently visually
attended to and then estimates gaze direction based on the attended hand; 2) a
new gaze estimator that uses cross-modal Transformers to fuse head and
hand-object features extracted using a convolutional neural network and a
spatio-temporal graph convolutional network; and 3) a novel eye-head
coordination loss that upgrades training samples belonging to the coordinated
eye-head movements. We evaluate HOIGaze on the HOT3D and Aria digital twin
(ADT) datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving an average improvement of 15.6% on HOT3D and 6.0% on ADT in
mean angular error. To demonstrate the potential of our method, we further
report significant performance improvements for the sample downstream task of
eye-based activity recognition on ADT. Taken together, our results underline
the significant information content available in eye-hand-head coordination
and, as such, open up an exciting new direction for learning-based gaze
estimation.

Conclusion: AnimateAnywhere在无需相机轨迹的情况下，实现了背景与人体动作的协调动画生成。

Abstract: Human image animation aims to generate human videos of given characters and
backgrounds that adhere to the desired pose sequence. However, existing methods
focus more on human actions while neglecting the generation of background,
which typically leads to static results or inharmonious movements. The
community has explored camera pose-guided animation tasks, yet preparing the
camera trajectory is impractical for most entertainment applications and
ordinary users. As a remedy, we present an AnimateAnywhere framework, rousing
the background in human image animation without requirements on camera
trajectories. In particular, based on our key insight that the movement of the
human body often reflects the motion of the background, we introduce a
background motion learner (BML) to learn background motions from human pose
sequences. To encourage the model to learn more accurate cross-frame
correspondences, we further deploy an epipolar constraint on the 3D attention
map. Specifically, the mask used to suppress geometrically unreasonable
attention is carefully constructed by combining an epipolar mask and the
current 3D attention map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
AnimateAnywhere effectively learns the background motion from human pose
sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generating human animation
results with vivid and realistic backgrounds. The source code and model will be

Conclusion: SRMF框架有效解决长尾问题，性能达到SOTA。

Abstract: The long-tail problem presents a significant challenge to the advancement of
semantic segmentation in ultra-high-resolution (UHR) satellite imagery. While
previous efforts in UHR semantic segmentation have largely focused on
multi-branch network architectures that emphasize multi-scale feature
extraction and fusion, they have often overlooked the importance of addressing
the long-tail issue. In contrast to prior UHR methods that focused on
independent feature extraction, we emphasize data augmentation and multimodal
feature fusion to alleviate the long-tail problem. In this paper, we introduce
SRMF, a novel framework for semantic segmentation in UHR satellite imagery. Our
approach addresses the long-tail class distribution by incorporating a
multi-scale cropping technique alongside a data augmentation strategy based on
semantic reordering and resampling. To further enhance model performance, we
propose a multimodal fusion-based general representation knowledge injection
method, which, for the first time, fuses text and visual features without the
need for individual region text descriptions, extracting more robust features.
Extensive experiments on the URUR, GID, and FBP datasets demonstrate that our
method improves mIoU by 3.33\%, 0.66\%, and 0.98\%, respectively, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Segmentation to Human-Object Interaction
(\textit{\textbf{Seg2HOI}}) approach, a novel framework that integrates
segmentation-based vision foundation models with the human-object interaction
task, distinguished from traditional detection-based Human-Object Interaction
(HOI) methods. Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the
standard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets
by including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically,
Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g.,
promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies
these attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional
training mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such
features still operate efficiently. Extensive experiments on two public
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Seg2HOI achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, even in zero-shot scenarios. Lastly, we propose that
Seg2HOI can generate HOI quadruplets and interactive HOI segmentation from
novel text and visual prompts that were not used during training, making it
versatile for a wide range of applications by leveraging this flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TCSD的新方法，通过整合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的反馈，解决了SDS在文本到3D生成中的语义对齐问题，并展示了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDS方法在生成多对象复杂交互的3D内容时，难以保持语义一致性，且优化过程中存在视图无关的偏差累积问题。

Method: 提出TCSD目标，利用MLLMs的跨模态理解能力评估和指导文本-3D对齐，并开发了3DLLaVA-CRITIC模型和LLM布局初始化方法。

Result: CoherenDream框架在多个基准测试中表现优异，特别是在文本对齐和语义交互方面。

Conclusion: TCSD通过MLLMs的反馈显著提升了文本到3D生成的语义对齐效果，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has achieved remarkable success in
text-to-3D content generation. However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain
semantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple
objects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D
consistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this
strategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The
limitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases
during optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment
direction. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective,
dubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates
alignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD
leverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide
the text-3D correspondence during the optimization. We further develop
3DLLaVA-CRITIC - a fine-tuned MLLM specialized for evaluating multiview text
alignment in 3D generations. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-layout
initialization that significantly accelerates optimization convergence through
semantic-aware spatial configuration. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that our framework, CoherenDream, establishes state-of-the-art performance in
text-aligned 3D generation across multiple benchmarks, including T$^3$Bench and
TIFA subset. Qualitative results showcase the superior performance of
CoherenDream in preserving textual consistency and semantic interactions. As
the first study to incorporate MLLMs into SDS optimization, we also conduct
extensive ablation studies to explore optimal MLLM adaptations for 3D
generation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从单目广播视频中推断乒乓球初始旋转和3D轨迹的新方法，仅使用合成数据训练神经网络，无需真实数据即可泛化到实际场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析乒乓球运动员技术需要球的3D轨迹和旋转信息，但旋转无法直接从标准广播视频中观测到。

Method: 通过合成数据训练神经网络，利用物理正确的输入数据表示和针对性增强，实现从2D轨迹推断3D轨迹和旋转。

Result: 在旋转分类上达到92.0%的准确率，2D重投影误差为图像对角线的0.19%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了在单目广播视频中预测球的旋转和轨迹，且仅需合成数据即可泛化到真实场景。

Abstract: Analyzing a player's technique in table tennis requires knowledge of the
ball's 3D trajectory and spin. While, the spin is not directly observable in
standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's
trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin
and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without
ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on
synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically
correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network
naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are
sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for
training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method
for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos,
achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection
error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.

Conclusion: DeeCLIP在检测AI生成图像方面表现出色，具有高鲁棒性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces DeeCLIP, a novel framework for detecting AI-generated
images using CLIP-ViT and fusion learning. Despite significant advancements in
generative models capable of creating highly photorealistic images, existing
detection methods often struggle to generalize across different models and are
highly sensitive to minor perturbations. To address these challenges, DeeCLIP
incorporates DeeFuser, a fusion module that combines high-level and low-level
features, improving robustness against degradations such as compression and
blurring. Additionally, we apply triplet loss to refine the embedding space,
enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between real and synthetic
content. To further enable lightweight adaptation while preserving pre-trained
knowledge, we adopt parameter-efficient fine-tuning using low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) within the CLIP-ViT backbone. This approach supports effective zero-shot
learning without sacrificing generalization. Trained exclusively on 4-class
ProGAN data, DeeCLIP achieves an average accuracy of 89.00% on 19 test subsets
composed of generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion models. Despite
having fewer trainable parameters, DeeCLIP outperforms existing methods,
demonstrating superior robustness against various generative models and
real-world distortions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FedCAug的联邦因果增强方法，通过因果数据增强打破属性与类别间的虚假关联，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因教师模型在分布外样本上表现有限及增强数据与原始数据的质量差距，未能充分利用上下文信息。

Method: 设计了因果区域定位模块和因果数据增强模块，生成反事实样本，无需客户端间信息共享。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验显示，FedCAug显著减少模型对背景的依赖，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedCAug通过因果增强有效提升联邦学习性能，同时保护数据隐私。

Abstract: Federated learning aims to collaboratively model by integrating multi-source
information to obtain a model that can generalize across all client data.
Existing methods often leverage knowledge distillation or data augmentation to
mitigate the negative impact of data bias across clients. However, the limited
performance of teacher models on out-of-distribution samples and the inherent
quality gap between augmented and original data hinder their effectiveness and
they typically fail to leverage the advantages of incorporating rich contextual
information. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Federated
Causal Augmentation method, termed FedCAug, which employs causality-inspired
data augmentation to break the spurious correlation between attributes and
categories. Specifically, it designs a causal region localization module to
accurately identify and decouple the background and objects in the image,
providing rich contextual information for causal data augmentation.
Additionally, it designs a causality-inspired data augmentation module that
integrates causal features and within-client context to generate counterfactual
samples. This significantly enhances data diversity, and the entire process
does not require any information sharing between clients, thereby contributing
to the protection of data privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three
datasets reveal that FedCAug markedly reduces the model's reliance on
background to predict sample labels, achieving superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自监督学习和深度混合模型HybMNet的新方法，用于提升乳腺癌筛查的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量标注医学数据的稀缺限制了AI在乳腺癌诊断中的应用，需要减少数据依赖。

Method: 采用两阶段学习：自监督预训练（EsViT）和下游任务训练（HybMNet结合Swin-T和CNN）。

Result: 在CMMD和INbreast数据集上分别达到AUC 0.864和0.889，表现优异。

Conclusion: HybMNet通过结合全局和局部信息，显著提升了乳腺癌检测性能。

Abstract: Purpose: The scarcity of high-quality curated labeled medical training data
remains one of the major limitations in applying artificial intelligence (AI)
systems to breast cancer diagnosis. Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass
(or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of
labeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To
reduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages
self-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \textbf{HybMNet},
which combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to
enhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.
  Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL
Pretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer
(Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves
as the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed
HybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel
fusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify
informative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the
CNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected
patches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both
networks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end,
with the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to
optimize feature extraction and classification performance.
  Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast
cancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms.
Leveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95%
CI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the
INbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness.

Result: 实验表明CineVerse在生成视觉连贯和上下文丰富的电影场景方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CineVerse为电影视频合成领域的进一步探索奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present CineVerse, a novel framework for the task of cinematic scene
composition. Similar to traditional multi-shot generation, our task emphasizes
the need for consistency and continuity across frames. However, our task also
focuses on addressing challenges inherent to filmmaking, such as multiple
characters, complex interactions, and visual cinematic effects. In order to
learn to generate such content, we first create the CineVerse dataset. We use
this dataset to train our proposed two-stage approach. First, we prompt a large
language model (LLM) with task-specific instructions to take in a high-level
scene description and generate a detailed plan for the overall setting and
characters, as well as the individual shots. Then, we fine-tune a text-to-image
generation model to synthesize high-quality visual keyframes. Experimental
results demonstrate that CineVerse yields promising improvements in generating
visually coherent and contextually rich movie scenes, paving the way for
further exploration in cinematic video synthesis.

Conclusion: MVPT-NET为医学影像任务提供了高效、可扩展的多视角数据集成方案，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is
crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies
have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer
detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more
comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical
imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with
large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view
Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening
mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on
high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature
learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively
tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\%) while retaining the
robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration
of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach
offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,
providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution
mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while
maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for
distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights
the potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable
solution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.

Abstract: The automatic summarization of surgical videos is essential for enhancing
procedural documentation, supporting surgical training, and facilitating
post-operative analysis. This paper presents a novel method at the intersection
of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning
models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a
multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and
large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. % The approach
is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into
clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual
transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and
surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into
frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with
temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level
summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the
clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a
dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. % We evaluate our method on
the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50
laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\%
precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context
summarization. This work contributes to the advancement of AI-assisted tools
for surgical reporting, offering a step toward more intelligent and reliable
clinical documentation.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>

Motivation: 尽管H.266/VVC在压缩性能上有显著提升，但解码端对更高感知质量的需求和编码端的压缩性能仍面临挑战。AI技术，尤其是基于深度学习的视频质量增强方法，为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 论文提出了一种改进的Omniscient视频质量增强网络（OVQE-VVC），并将其集成到最新的STD-VVC解码器架构中。该网络利用了时空特征和跨频率信息来提升视觉质量。

Result: 实验表明，OVQE-VVC解决方案在多种测试条件下显著提升了PSNR（约0.74 dB至1.2 dB），同时节省了约19.6%的比特率。

Conclusion: OVQE-VVC是一种有效的视频质量增强方法，能够显著提升H.266/VVC压缩视频的感知质量并节省比特率。

Abstract: The latest video coding standard H.266/VVC has shown its great improvement in
terms of compression performance when compared to its predecessor HEVC
standard. Though VVC was implemented with many advanced techniques, it still
met the same challenges as its predecessor due to the need for even higher
perceptual quality demand at the decoder side as well as the compression
performance at the encoder side. The advancement of Artificial Intelligence
(AI) technology, notably the deep learning-based video quality enhancement
methods, was shown to be a promising approach to improving the perceptual
quality experience. In this paper, we propose a novel Omniscient video quality
enhancement Network for VVC compressed Videos. The Omniscient Network for
compressed video quality enhancement was originally designed for HEVC
compressed videos in which not only the spatial-temporal features but also
cross-frequencies information were employed to augment the visual quality.
Inspired by this work, we propose a modification of the OVQE model and
integrate it into the lasted STD-VVC (Standard Versatile Video Coding) decoder
architecture. As assessed in a rich set of test conditions, the proposed
OVQE-VVC solution is able to achieve significant PSNR improvement, notably
around 0.74 dB and up to 1.2 dB with respect to the original STD-VVC codec.
This also corresponds to around 19.6% of bitrate saving while keeping a similar
quality observation.

Result: 在Replica和FAST-LIVO2数据集上达到SOTA性能，GPU内存占用较低。

Conclusion: Mesh-Learner在兼容性和性能上表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed
Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization
pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e.,
texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each
mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating
surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel
interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated
to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features
of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render,
which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and
tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for
robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast,
unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to
the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM,
which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on
interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2
datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To

Conclusion: Shopformer是首个基于姿态序列的Transformer模型，为零售监控提供了高效、隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Shoplifting remains a costly issue for the retail sector, but traditional
surveillance systems, which are mostly based on human monitoring, are still
largely ineffective, with only about 2% of shoplifters being arrested. Existing
AI-based approaches rely on pixel-level video analysis which raises privacy
concerns, is sensitive to environmental variations, and demands significant
computational resources. To address these limitations, we introduce Shopformer,
a novel transformer-based model that detects shoplifting by analyzing pose
sequences rather than raw video. We propose a custom tokenization strategy that
converts pose sequences into compact embeddings for efficient transformer
processing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pose-sequence-based
transformer model for shoplifting detection. Evaluated on real-world pose data,
our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection models, offering a
privacy-preserving, and scalable solution for real-time retail surveillance.

Conclusion: 该方法为政策制定者提供了高效、低成本的杂草管理监测工具，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity,
as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water.
Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to
assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity,
and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However,
monitoring weed management methods is challenging as commonly rely on on-ground
field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In
order to tackle this problem, we leverage Earth Observation (EO) data and
Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed an ML approach for mapping
four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and
No practice) in orchards using satellite image time series (SITS) data from two
different sources: Sentinel-2 (S2) and PlanetScope (PS). The findings
demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.

TL;DR: 论文提出SpatialReasoner，一种新型大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），通过显式3D表示改进3D空间推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的3D空间推理方法多为隐式推理，且未充分验证其对未见问题的泛化能力。

Method: SpatialReasoner采用显式3D表示，分阶段（感知、计算、推理）共享3D信息，提升推理能力。

Result: 模型在多个空间推理基准上表现优异，对未见问题泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该研究结合视觉基础模型的3D解析能力与大型语言模型的推理能力，为3D空间推理开辟新方向。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D spatial reasoning explore data-driven approaches and
achieve enhanced spatial reasoning performance with reinforcement learning
(RL). However, these methods typically perform spatial reasoning in an implicit
manner, and it remains underexplored whether the acquired 3D knowledge
generalizes to unseen question types at any stage of the training. In this work
we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that
address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between
stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D
representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial
reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show
that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial
reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial
reasoning questions. Our study bridges the 3D parsing capabilities of prior
visual foundation models with the powerful reasoning abilities of large
language models, opening new directions for 3D spatial reasoning.

TL;DR: LIRM是一种基于Transformer的架构，能在一秒内联合重建高质量的形状、材质和辐射场，并解决现有LRM在重建未见部分和光泽外观时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRM在重建未见部分和光泽外观时表现不佳，且无法生成可被标准图形引擎使用的可重光照3D内容。

Method: 提出三个关键技术：渐进式更新模型、六平面神经SDF表示和神经方向嵌入机制。

Result: 在几何和重光照精度上优于基于优化的密集视图逆渲染方法，且推理时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: LIRM为多视图3D重建提供了更实用的框架，具有高效和高质量的特点。

Abstract: We present Large Inverse Rendering Model (LIRM), a transformer architecture
that jointly reconstructs high-quality shape, materials, and radiance fields
with view-dependent effects in less than a second. Our model builds upon the
recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) that achieve state-of-the-art
sparse-view reconstruction quality. However, existing LRMs struggle to
reconstruct unseen parts accurately and cannot recover glossy appearance or
generate relightable 3D contents that can be consumed by standard Graphics
engines. To address these limitations, we make three key technical
contributions to build a more practical multi-view 3D reconstruction framework.
First, we introduce an update model that allows us to progressively add more
input views to improve our reconstruction. Second, we propose a hexa-plane
neural SDF representation to better recover detailed textures, geometry and
material parameters. Third, we develop a novel neural directional-embedding
mechanism to handle view-dependent effects. Trained on a large-scale shape and
material dataset with a tailored coarse-to-fine training scheme, our model
achieves compelling results. It compares favorably to optimization-based
dense-view inverse rendering methods in terms of geometry and relighting
accuracy, while requiring only a fraction of the inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CODrone是一个针对无人机定向物体检测（OOD）的综合数据集，解决了现有数据集在真实飞行场景中泛化能力不足的问题，并通过多城市、多光照条件下的图像标注提升了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机OOD数据集多为特定任务设计，泛化能力差，无法充分验证算法在实际环境中的有效性。CODrone旨在填补这一数据缺口，提供更贴近真实场景的基准。

Method: 通过分析现有数据集的四大局限性（低分辨率、有限类别、单视角成像、固定飞行高度），提出改进方案，并收集多城市、多光照条件下的标注图像。

Result: CODrone作为新基准，通过22种经典或SOTA方法的实验验证了其有效性，并揭示了无人机OOD的关键瓶颈与机遇。

Conclusion: CODrone填补了无人机OOD领域的数据空白，提供了泛化能力更强的基准，更贴合实际应用与未来算法开发。

Abstract: Applications of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in logistics, agricultural
automation, urban management, and emergency response are highly dependent on
oriented object detection (OOD) to enhance visual perception. Although existing
datasets for OOD in UAV provide valuable resources, they are often designed for
specific downstream tasks.Consequently, they exhibit limited generalization
performance in real flight scenarios and fail to thoroughly demonstrate
algorithm effectiveness in practical environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for
UAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions. It also serves as a new
benchmark designed to align with downstream task requirements, ensuring greater
applicability and robustness in UAV-based OOD.Based on application
requirements, we identify four key limitations in current UAV OOD datasets-low
image resolution, limited object categories, single-view imaging, and
restricted flight altitudes-and propose corresponding improvements to enhance
their applicability and robustness.Furthermore, CODrone contains a broad
spectrum of annotated images collected from multiple cities under various
lighting conditions, enhancing the realism of the benchmark. To rigorously
evaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel
challenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22
classical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of
CODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and
opportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the
data gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced
generalization capability, better aligning with practical applications and
future algorithm development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗图像分析中数据分散存储和大数据集不可行的问题。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，利用历史任务生成的图像指导新任务模型训练。

Result: 在PI-CAI等数据集上表现优异，模型收敛更快。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是医疗图像增量学习中的有效技术。

Abstract: This paper proposes an Incremental Learning (IL) approach to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models in analyzing T2-weighted (T2w)
MRI medical images prostate cancer detection using the PI-CAI dataset. We used
multiple health centers' artificial intelligence and radiology data, focused on
different tasks that looked at prostate cancer detection using MRI (PI-CAI). We
utilized Knowledge Distillation (KD), as it employs generated images from past
tasks to guide the training of models for subsequent tasks. The approach
yielded improved performance and faster convergence of the models. To
demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, we evaluated it on
the PI-CAI dataset, a diverse set of medical imaging modalities including OCT
and PathMNIST, and the benchmark continual learning dataset CIFAR-10. Our
results indicate that KD can be a promising technique for IL in medical image
analysis in which data is sourced from individual health centers and the
storage of large datasets is not feasible. By using generated images from prior
tasks, our method enables the model to retain and apply previously acquired
knowledge without direct access to the original data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合单目深度和法线先验的改进SfM方法，显著提升了在极端视角变化下的性能，并解决了对称性导致的错误关联问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM系统在极端视角变化、低重叠或高对称性场景中容易失败，限制了其广泛应用。本文旨在通过引入深度学习推断的单目先验来解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将单目深度和法线先验与经典SfM范式紧密结合，利用多视图约束和不确定性传播，提升了鲁棒性和适应性。

Result: 该方法在极端视角变化下显著优于现有方法，并能有效解决对称性导致的错误关联问题，首次实现了从少量图像可靠重建复杂室内环境。

Conclusion: 结合单目先验的SfM方法具有鲁棒性，能够适应不同模型推断的先验，未来可受益于单目深度和法线估计的进步。

Abstract: While Structure-from-Motion (SfM) has seen much progress over the years,
state-of-the-art systems are prone to failure when facing extreme viewpoint
changes in low-overlap, low-parallax or high-symmetry scenarios. Because
capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging, this severely limits
the wider use of SfM, especially by non-expert users. We overcome these
limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and
normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration
of monocular and multi-view constraints, our approach significantly outperforms
existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes, while maintaining strong
performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help
reject faulty associations due to symmetries, which is a long-standing problem
for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing
challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty
propagation, it is robust to errors in the priors, can handle priors inferred
by different models with little tuning, and will thus easily benefit from
future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/cvg/mpsfm.

Motivation: 实时视频理解在嵌入式AI和自动驾驶等应用中至关重要，但现有方法难以同时满足高效处理、历史信息保留和低延迟决策的需求。

Method: 结合因果时间注意力机制的预训练视觉Transformer，并通过多任务视觉-语言对齐框架统一训练。

Result: 在在线动作检测、视频实例分割和视频问答任务中表现优异，同时保持高效性。

Conclusion: StreamFormer展示了在实时视频理解任务中的潜力，为流式视频处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time
applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video
understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process
video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make
low-latency decisions.To address these challenges, our main contributions are
three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as
StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained
vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while
maintaining image representation capability.(ii) To train StreamFormer, we
propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a
multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns
global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships
simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action
detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering.
StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency,
demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以保留独特细节（如服装图案或配饰），且基于参考的图像修复方法在捕捉细粒度细节方面表现不佳。

Method: 采用双U-Net架构和RFA块，引导模型关注参考图像中的相关区域，确保语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明，CompleteMe在视觉质量和语义一致性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CompleteMe有效解决了人体图像补全中的细节保留问题，并提供了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent methods for human image completion can reconstruct plausible body
shapes but often fail to preserve unique details, such as specific clothing
patterns or distinctive accessories, without explicit reference images. Even
state-of-the-art reference-based inpainting approaches struggle to accurately
capture and integrate fine-grained details from reference images. To address
this limitation, we propose CompleteMe, a novel reference-based human image
completion framework. CompleteMe employs a dual U-Net architecture combined
with a Region-focused Attention (RFA) Block, which explicitly guides the
model's attention toward relevant regions in reference images. This approach
effectively captures fine details and ensures accurate semantic correspondence,
significantly improving the fidelity and consistency of completed images.
Additionally, we introduce a challenging benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating reference-based human image completion tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior visual quality and
semantic consistency compared to existing techniques. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种认知-机制框架（COGMIF），结合ACT-R数字孪生和TimeGAN增强模拟，改进传统HRA方法，实现可扩展的人类错误概率评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HRA方法依赖专家判断和规则，忽略认知基础，且实验成本高。

Method: 整合ACT-R数字孪生模拟认知过程，TimeGAN生成合成数据，驱动IDHEAS-ECA评估。

Result: COGMIF在比较分析中表现稳健，量化了操作风险的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: COGMIF为工业HRA实践提供了高效且可信的认知理论整合路径。

Abstract: Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA,
rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive
underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop
experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due
to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a
cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA
methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with
TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition,
including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and
perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource
constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on
ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator
behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA
assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error
probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity
assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed
COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to
quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of
operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient
pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.

Abstract: With the timely formation of personalized intervention plans based on
high-dimensional heterogeneous time series information becoming an important
challenge in the medical field today, electronic medical records, wearables,
and other multi-source medical data are increasingly generated and diversified.
In this work, we develop a system to generate personalized medical intervention
strategies based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Time-Series
Data Fusion. First, by incorporating relative policy constraints among the
groups during policy gradient updates, we adaptively balance individual and
group gains. To improve the robustness and interpretability of decision-making,
a multi-layer neural network structure is employed to group-code patient
characteristics. Second, for the rapid multi-modal fusion of multi-source
heterogeneous time series, a multi-channel neural network combined with a
self-attention mechanism is used for dynamic feature extraction. Key feature
screening and aggregation are achieved through a differentiable gating network.
Finally, a collaborative search process combining a genetic algorithm and Monte
Carlo tree search is proposed to find the ideal intervention strategy,
achieving global optimization. Experimental results show significant
improvements in accuracy, coverage, and decision-making benefits compared with
existing methods.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型如ChatGPT-4在自动化物种名称管理中具有潜力，尽管存在局限性，但能显著提高本体开发的效率。

Abstract: Managing scientific names in ontologies that represent species taxonomies is
challenging due to the ever-evolving nature of these taxonomies. Manually
maintaining these names becomes increasingly difficult when dealing with
thousands of scientific names. To address this issue, this paper investigates
the use of ChatGPT-4 to automate the development of the :Organism module in the
Agricultural Product Types Ontology (APTO) for species classification. Our
methodology involved leveraging ChatGPT-4 to extract data from the GBIF
Backbone API and generate OWL files for further integration in APTO. Two
alternative approaches were explored: (1) issuing a series of prompts for
ChatGPT-4 to execute tasks via the BrowserOP plugin and (2) directing ChatGPT-4
to design a Python algorithm to perform analogous tasks. Both approaches rely
on a prompting method where we provide instructions, context, input data, and
an output indicator. The first approach showed scalability limitations, while
the second approach used the Python algorithm to overcome these challenges, but
it struggled with typographical errors in data handling. This study highlights
the potential of Large language models like ChatGPT-4 to streamline the
management of species names in ontologies. Despite certain limitations, these
tools offer promising advancements in automating taxonomy-related tasks and
improving the efficiency of ontology development.

Abstract: Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) detection presents significant challenges
due to the subtle and often ambiguous presentation of symptoms in medical
imaging, making accurate diagnosis a complex task. To address these challenges,
we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates
multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large
language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models
using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI
symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through
a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions
from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a
model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the
most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between
the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final
decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This
end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model
consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt
engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was
developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport
News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The
results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned
vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a
robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction.
To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of
fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI
prediction tasks.

Conclusion: HRL在复杂导航任务中表现更优，子目标和终止函数是关键因素。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is hypothesized to be able to take
advantage of the inherent hierarchy in robot learning tasks with sparse reward
schemes, in contrast to more traditional reinforcement learning algorithms. In
this research, hierarchical reinforcement learning is evaluated and contrasted
with standard reinforcement learning in complex navigation tasks. We evaluate
unique characteristics of HRL, including their ability to create sub-goals and
the termination function. We constructed experiments to test the differences
between PPO and HRL, different ways of creating sub-goals, manual vs automatic
sub-goal creation, and the effects of the frequency of termination on
performance. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL and how it
achieves these advantages.

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) builds upon Generative AI (GenAI). It
constitutes the next major step in the evolution of AI with much stronger
reasoning and interaction capabilities that enable more autonomous behavior to
tackle complex tasks. Since the initial release of ChatGPT (3.5), Generative AI
has seen widespread adoption, giving users firsthand experience. However, the
distinction between Agentic AI and GenAI remains less well understood. To
address this gap, our survey is structured in two parts. In the first part, we
compare GenAI and Agentic AI using existing literature, discussing their key
characteristics, how Agentic AI remedies limitations of GenAI, and the major
steps in GenAI's evolution toward Agentic AI. This section is intended for a
broad audience, including academics in both social sciences and engineering, as
well as industry professionals. It provides the necessary insights to
comprehend novel applications that are possible with Agentic AI but not with
GenAI. In the second part, we deep dive into novel aspects of Agentic AI,
including recent developments and practical concerns such as defining agents.
Finally, we discuss several challenges that could serve as a future research
agenda, while cautioning against risks that can emerge when exceeding human
intelligence.

Motivation: MOF合成条件复杂且多样，传统方法难以高效识别特定MOF的最佳合成条件。

Method: 通过LLM（gpt-4o-mini）整合多种MOF相关代理（合成、属性和化学信息代理），开发了MOFh6工具。

Result: MOFh6支持多格式查询，提供最优合成条件并生成预建模文件。

Conclusion: MOFh6有望提升MOF合成研究的效率。

Abstract: The mining of synthesis conditions for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a
significant focus in materials science. However, identifying the precise
synthesis conditions for specific MOFs within the vast array of possibilities
presents a considerable challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a
promising solution to this problem. We leveraged the capabilities of LLMs,
specifically gpt-4o-mini, as core agents to integrate various MOF-related
agents, including synthesis, attribute, and chemical information agents. This
integration culminated in the development of MOFh6, an LLM tool designed to
streamline the MOF synthesis process. MOFh6 allows users to query in multiple
formats, such as submitting scientific literature, or inquiring about specific
MOF codes or structural properties. The tool analyzes these queries to provide
optimal synthesis conditions and generates model files for density functional
theory pre modeling. We believe MOFh6 will enhance efficiency in the MOF
synthesis of all researchers.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和工具在资源有限的环境中具有实际应用价值，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of development programmes can involve
field-based data collection about project activities. This data collection
through digital devices may not always be feasible though, for reasons such as
unaffordability of smartphones and tablets by field-based cadre, or shortfalls
in their training and capacity building. Paper-based data collection has been
argued to be more appropriate in several contexts, with automated digitization
of the paper forms through OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and OMR (Optical
Mark Recognition) techniques. We contribute with providing a large dataset of
handwritten digits, and deep learning based models and methods built using this
data, that are effective in real-world environments. We demonstrate the
deployment of these tools in the context of a maternal and child health and
nutrition awareness project, which uses IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
systems to provide awareness information to rural women SHG (Self Help Group)
members in north India. Paper forms were used to collect phone numbers of the
SHG members at scale, which were digitized using the OCR tools developed by us,
and used to push almost 4 million phone calls. The data, model, and code have
been released in the open-source domain.

Result: 发现两种新现象：长度依赖的机械交叉和链长/二级结构稳定性图。

Conclusion: Sparks能够独立进行严谨的科学探究，并识别未知科学原理。

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet
most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We
present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire
discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and
iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without
human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously
unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby
beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond
~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and
(ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly
robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance
in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed
reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy
structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired
generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility.
The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific
inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义推理方法计算成本高且效率随本体规模下降，传统机器学习难以捕捉复杂关系，大型语言模型在结构化推理上表现不佳。

Method: 将OWL本体转换为图结构数据，并采用图语言模型（GLM）架构进行一致性检查。

Result: 在NCBO BioPortal本体上，GLaMoR准确率达95%，速度比传统推理器快20倍。

Conclusion: GLaMoR为语义推理提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic reasoning aims to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge, with
OWL ontologies serving as a standardized framework for organizing information.
A key challenge in semantic reasoning is verifying ontology consistency.
However, state-of-the-art reasoners are computationally expensive, and their
efficiency decreases as ontology sizes grow. While classical machine learning
models have been explored for consistency checking, they struggle to capture
complex relationships within ontologies. Large language models (LLMs) have
shown promising results for simple reasoning tasks but perform poorly on
structured reasoning. The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers
a way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper
proposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that
transforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM
architecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from
the NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model
input. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving
$95\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法在平衡邻近性、多样性和鲁棒性方面存在不足，限制了实际应用。

Method: 引入基于Dice-Sorensen系数的新鲁棒性指标，并使用加权损失组件优化反事实生成。

Result: 在多个数据集和ML后端上验证，DiCE-Extended在有效性、稳定性和决策边界对齐方面优于标准DiCE。

Conclusion: DiCE-Extended为高风险应用提供了更可靠和可解释的反事实解释，未来将探索自适应优化和领域特定约束。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law.
Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with
actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that
lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF
generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and
robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted
framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but
lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain
constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an
enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization
techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our
approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-Sorensen
coefficient, ensuring stability under small input variations. Additionally, we
refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d,
lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically
validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German
Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch,
TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment
with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our
findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable
and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work will explore
adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further
enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: ChiseLLM通过数据增强和领域适应训练，显著提升了Chisel代码生成的语法正确性和设计多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型在Chisel代码生成中存在语法正确性和设计多样性不足的问题，需要领域适应方法提升性能。

Method: 采用数据处理与转换、提示引导的推理轨迹合成和领域适应模型训练，构建高质量数据集并优化模型。

Result: ChiseLLM-7B和ChiseLLM-32B分别将语法正确性提升18.85%和26.32%，设计多样性提升47.58%。

Conclusion: ChiseLLM为基于HCL的敏捷硬件开发提供了高性能、低成本模型，并为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The growing demand for Domain-Specific Architecture (DSA) has driven the
development of Agile Hardware Development Methodology (AHDM). Hardware
Construction Language (HCL) like Chisel offers high-level abstraction features,
making it an ideal language for HCL-Based AHDM. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) excel in code generation tasks, they still face challenges with Chisel
generation, particularly regarding syntax correctness and design variability.
Recent reasoning models have significantly enhanced code generation
capabilities through test-time scaling techniques. However, we found that
reasoning models without domain adaptation cannot bring substantial benefits to
Chisel code generation tasks. This paper presents ChiseLLM, a solution
comprising data processing and transformation, prompt-guided reasoning trace
synthesis, and domain-adapted model training. We constructed high-quality
datasets from public RTL code resources and guided the model to adopt
structured thinking patterns through prompt enhancement methods. Experiments
demonstrate that our ChiseLLM-7B and ChiseLLM-32B models improved syntax
correctness by 18.85% and 26.32% respectively over base models, while
increasing variability design ability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning
models. Our datasets and models are publicly available, providing
high-performance, cost-effective models for HCL-Based AHDM, and offering an
effective baseline for future research. Github repository:

TL;DR: ADAR框架通过双权重机制和自动增长/剪枝策略，优化高维数据的神经模糊推理系统，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据在神经模糊系统中带来的挑战，同时保持模型的性能和可解释性。

Method: 集成双权重机制（属性和规则的自适应权重）及自动增长/剪枝策略，动态简化模糊模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ADAR模型的RMSE显著低于现有方法，如北京PM2.5数据集的RMSE为56.87。

Conclusion: ADAR能有效平衡规则复杂性和特征重要性，适用于高精度且透明的神经模糊系统。

Abstract: This paper presents an Adaptive Dynamic Attribute and Rule (ADAR) framework
designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in
neuro-fuzzy inference systems. By integrating dual weighting
mechanisms-assigning adaptive importance to both attributes and rules-together
with automated growth and pruning strategies, ADAR adaptively streamlines
complex fuzzy models without sacrificing performance or interpretability.
Experimental evaluations on four diverse datasets - Auto MPG (7 variables),
Beijing PM2.5 (10 variables), Boston Housing (13 variables), and Appliances
Energy Consumption (27 variables) show that ADAR-based models achieve
consistently lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art
baselines. On the Beijing PM2.5 dataset, for instance, ADAR-SOFENN attained an
RMSE of 56.87 with nine rules, surpassing traditional ANFIS [12] and SOFENN
[16] models. Similarly, on the high-dimensional Appliances Energy dataset,
ADAR-ANFIS reached an RMSE of 83.25 with nine rules, outperforming established
fuzzy logic approaches and interpretability-focused methods such as APLR.
Ablation studies further reveal that combining rule-level and attribute-level
weight assignment significantly reduces model overlap while preserving
essential features, thereby enhancing explainability. These results highlight
ADAR's effectiveness in dynamically balancing rule complexity and feature
importance, paving the way for scalable, high-accuracy, and transparent
neuro-fuzzy systems applicable to a range of real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出一个疾病无关的需求集合，针对不同医疗流程和利益相关者，确保AI系统符合TAI原则，并以心血管疾病为例验证。

Result: 框架展示了如何在实践中应用TAI原则，同时识别了实施中的挑战和权衡。

Conclusion: 通过设计框架，医疗AI系统能更好地满足TAI原则，促进临床采用，但仍需解决实际障碍。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare,
particularly in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and patient care. The increasing
availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and
electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI
models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical
adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical
performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of
trust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of
Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic
robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination
avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes
(e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of
stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the
integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and
practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support
developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each
stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a
disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should
incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the
challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in
practice. To ground the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, a
field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate
how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist.

Result: 所有模型在关怀/伤害和公平/欺骗维度表现一致，但在其他维度较弱，且与人类伦理偏好相符。

Conclusion: PRIME框架为伦理评估提供了可扩展方法，揭示了当前AI伦理推理的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in consequential
decision-making contexts, systematically assessing their ethical reasoning
capabilities becomes a critical imperative. This paper introduces the
Priorities in Reasoning and Intrinsic Moral Evaluation (PRIME) framework--a
comprehensive methodology for analyzing moral priorities across foundational
ethical dimensions including consequentialist-deontological reasoning, moral
foundations theory, and Kohlberg's developmental stages. We apply this
framework to six leading LLMs through a dual-protocol approach combining direct
questioning and response analysis to established ethical dilemmas. Our analysis
reveals striking patterns of convergence: all evaluated models demonstrate
strong prioritization of care/harm and fairness/cheating foundations while
consistently underweighting authority, loyalty, and sanctity dimensions.
Through detailed examination of confidence metrics, response reluctance
patterns, and reasoning consistency, we establish that contemporary LLMs (1)
produce decisive ethical judgments, (2) demonstrate notable cross-model
alignment in moral decision-making, and (3) generally correspond with
empirically established human moral preferences. This research contributes a
scalable, extensible methodology for ethical benchmarking while highlighting
both the promising capabilities and systematic limitations in current AI moral
reasoning architectures--insights critical for responsible development as these
systems assume increasingly significant societal roles.

TL;DR: 研究评估了小型语言模型（SLMs）在生成函数调用任务中的表现，发现其在不同方法（零样本、少样本、微调）下表现逐步提升，但在输出格式上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在函数调用任务中计算成本高，而SLMs在资源受限环境中更具实用性，因此研究其性能。

Method: 采用零样本、少样本和微调方法，结合提示注入实验，评估SLMs在生成函数调用中的表现，并测试其在边缘设备上的延迟和内存使用。

Result: SLMs在微调后表现最佳，但对输出格式的遵循较差；提示注入实验显示模型鲁棒性较好。

Conclusion: SLMs在函数调用任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以满足实时需求。

Abstract: Function calling is a complex task with widespread applications in domains
such as information retrieval, software engineering and automation. For
example, a query to book the shortest flight from New York to London on January
15 requires identifying the correct parameters to generate accurate function
calls. Large Language Models (LLMs) can automate this process but are
computationally expensive and impractical in resource-constrained settings. In
contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) can operate efficiently, offering faster
response times, and lower computational demands, making them potential
candidates for function calling on edge devices. In this exploratory empirical
study, we evaluate the efficacy of SLMs in generating function calls across
diverse domains using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches, both
with and without prompt injection, while also providing the finetuned models to
facilitate future applications. Furthermore, we analyze the model responses
across a range of metrics, capturing various aspects of function call
generation. Additionally, we perform experiments on an edge device to evaluate
their performance in terms of latency and memory usage, providing useful
insights into their practical applicability. Our findings show that while SLMs
improve from zero-shot to few-shot and perform best with fine-tuning, they
struggle significantly with adhering to the given output format. Prompt
injection experiments further indicate that the models are generally robust and
exhibit only a slight decline in performance. While SLMs demonstrate potential
for the function call generation task, our results also highlight areas that
need further refinement for real-time functioning.

Result: 提出了适用于非经典逻辑语义范畴的推理算法，扩展了一阶统一的应用范围。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI代理在复杂语义范畴中的符号化推理提供了新的工具和理论基础。

Abstract: This paper seeks to apply categorical logic to the design of artificial
intelligent agents that reason symbolically about objects more richly
structured than sets. Using Johnstone's sequent calculus of terms- and
formulae-in-context, we develop forward chaining and normal form algorithms for
reasoning about objects in cartesian categories with the rules for Horn logic.
We also adapt first-order unification to support multi-sorted theories,
contexts, and fragments of first-order logic. The significance of these
reformulations rests in the fact that they can be applied to reasoning about
objects in semantic categories that do not support classical logic or even all
its connectives.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of mining patterns among data
features in the form of logical rules, with applications across a myriad of
domains. However, high-dimensional datasets often result in an excessive number
of rules, increasing execution time and negatively impacting downstream task
performance. Managing this rule explosion remains a central challenge in ARM
research. To address this, we introduce Aerial+, a novel neurosymbolic ARM
method. Aerial+ leverages an under-complete autoencoder to create a neural
representation of the data, capturing associations between features. It
extracts rules from this neural representation by exploiting the model's
reconstruction mechanism. Extensive evaluations on five datasets against seven
baselines demonstrate that Aerial+ achieves state-of-the-art results by
learning more concise, high-quality rule sets with full data coverage. When
integrated into rule-based interpretable machine learning models, Aerial+
significantly reduces execution time while maintaining or improving accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 下一代无线网络需要满足严格的QoS要求，而避免小区拥塞是关键挑战。

Method: 采用图强化学习（GRL）框架，将负载均衡建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用GNN和RL结合的方法设计状态和奖励信号。

Result: 相比基线方法，QoS违规减少53%，BE流量的5th百分位速率提升四倍。

Conclusion: GRL方法在负载均衡中表现出色，能够灵活处理不同网络规模并考虑空间节点依赖关系。

Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide
unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications,
necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data
rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention
of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient
radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User
Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach
is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best
Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS
and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement
Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural
Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,
with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both
state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained
using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based
architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of
nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of
accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the
GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show
substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations
and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.

Result: GVPO保证唯一最优解，支持灵活的采样分布，避免了传统方法的局限性。

Conclusion: GVPO为可靠且多功能的大语言模型后训练建立了新范式。

Abstract: Post-training plays a crucial role in refining and aligning large language
models to meet specific tasks and human preferences. While recent advancements
in post-training techniques, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
leverage increased sampling with relative reward scoring to achieve superior
performance, these methods often suffer from training instability that limits
their practical adoption. To address this challenge, we present Group Variance
Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to
KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring
alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical
interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the
central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers
two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the
KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling
distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations. By
unifying theoretical guarantees with practical adaptability, GVPO establishes a
new paradigm for reliable and versatile LLM post-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型如何根据证据的信息量和可靠性调整其置信度和响应。

Method: 创建包含多种证据类型的数据集，通过语言化置信度、标记概率和采样分析模型响应。

Result: 语言模型对真实证据遵循贝叶斯确认假设，但对其他证据类型表现不一致；强证据下模型可能高置信但未必高准确。

Conclusion: 语言模型对黄金证据有偏好，且表现因证据无关程度而异，解释了其偏离贝叶斯假设的原因。

Abstract: This paper investigates the knowledge of language models from the perspective
of Bayesian epistemology. We explore how language models adjust their
confidence and responses when presented with evidence with varying levels of
informativeness and reliability. To study these properties, we create a dataset
with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and
confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We
observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology:
language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true
evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering
different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can
exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always
guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are
biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the
degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian
assumptions.

Motivation: 研究LLM在算法搜索中的适应度景观，以更好地理解其搜索行为并优化LAS方法。

Method: 采用图论方法，节点表示算法，边表示算法间的转换，并在六种算法设计任务和六种LLM上进行评估。

Result: 发现LAS景观高度多模态且崎岖，任务类型和LLM选择显著影响景观结构，种群大小影响探索-开发权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对LAS景观的理解，并为设计更有效的LAS方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
algorithm design. However, when integrated into search frameworks for iterative
algorithm search, the underlying fitness landscape--critical for understanding
search behaviou--remains underexplored. In this paper, we illustrate and
analyze the fitness landscape of LLM-assisted Algorithm Search (LAS) using a
graph-based approach, where nodes represent algorithms and edges denote
transitions between them. We conduct extensive evaluations across six algorithm
design tasks and six commonly used LLMs. Our findings reveal that LAS
landscapes are highly multimodal and rugged, particularly in combinatorial
optimization tasks, with distinct structural variations across tasks and LLMs.
For instance, heuristic design tasks exhibit dense clusters of high-performing
algorithms, while symbolic regression tasks show sparse, scattered
distributions. Additionally, we demonstrate how population size influences
exploration-exploitation trade-offs and the evolving trajectory of elite
algorithms. These insights not only advance our understanding of LAS landscapes
but also provide practical guidance for designing more effective LAS methods.

Abstract: Large language models and autonomous AI agents have evolved rapidly,
resulting in a diverse array of evaluation benchmarks, frameworks, and
collaboration protocols. However, the landscape remains fragmented and lacks a
unified taxonomy or comprehensive survey. Therefore, we present a side-by-side
comparison of benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025 that evaluate these
models and agents across multiple domains. In addition, we propose a taxonomy
of approximately 60 benchmarks that cover general and academic knowledge
reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code generation and software
engineering, factual grounding and retrieval, domain-specific evaluations,
multimodal and embodied tasks, task orchestration, and interactive assessments.
Furthermore, we review AI-agent frameworks introduced between 2023 and 2025
that integrate large language models with modular toolkits to enable autonomous
decision-making and multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we present real-world
applications of autonomous AI agents in materials science, biomedical research,
academic ideation, software engineering, synthetic data generation, chemical
reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, geographic information systems,
multimedia, healthcare, and finance. We then survey key agent-to-agent
collaboration protocols, namely the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), the
Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A). Finally,
we discuss recommendations for future research, focusing on advanced reasoning
strategies, failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems, automated scientific
discovery, dynamic tool integration via reinforcement learning, integrated
search capabilities, and security vulnerabilities in agent protocols.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly autonomous
agentic systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery by improving in-silico modeling and
reducing dependence on costly experimental trials. Current AI agent-based
systems demonstrate proficiency in solving programming challenges and
conducting research, indicating an emerging potential to develop software
capable of addressing complex problems such as pharmaceutical design and drug
discovery. This paper introduces DO Challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate
the decision-making abilities of AI agents in a single, complex problem
resembling virtual screening scenarios. The benchmark challenges systems to
independently develop, implement, and execute efficient strategies for
identifying promising molecular structures from extensive datasets, while
navigating chemical space, selecting models, and managing limited resources in
a multi-objective context. We also discuss insights from the DO Challenge 2025,
a competition based on the proposed benchmark, which showcased diverse
strategies explored by human participants. Furthermore, we present the Deep
Thought multi-agent system, which demonstrated strong performance on the
benchmark, outperforming most human teams. Among the language models tested,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro and o3 performed best in primary agent roles,
and GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash were effective in auxiliary roles. While
promising, the system's performance still fell short of expert-designed
solutions and showed high instability, highlighting both the potential and
current limitations of AI-driven methodologies in transforming drug discovery
and broader scientific research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的决策支持系统（DSS），用于解决现实规模的动态任务分配问题（DTAP），通过引入图结构和等效奖励函数，显著提升了任务分配效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DRL方法大多局限于小规模合成问题，无法应对现实世界的挑战，因此需要开发一种能够处理现实规模DTAP的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种DRL代理，包含图结构的观察与动作表示以及等效于最小化任务平均周期时间的奖励函数。

Result: 在五个基于真实日志的DTAP实例中，该DRL代理表现优于或匹配最佳基线方法，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实规模的DTAP提供了一种高效且可泛化的解决方案，验证了其在真实场景中的实用性。

Abstract: The Dynamic Task Assignment Problem (DTAP) concerns matching resources to
tasks in real time while minimizing some objectives, like resource costs or
task cycle time. In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a
case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case,
involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process
requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most
research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the
challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work
proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.
To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph
structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP
and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of
minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two
novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment
policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP
instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process
mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or
outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on
different time horizons and across instances.

Result: 模型支持语义互操作性，用于结构化推理群体福祉和社会制度。

Conclusion: 该方法为群体福祉的长期建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper explores the ontological space of group well being, proposing a
framework for representing collective welfare, group functions, and long term
contributions within an ontology engineering context. Traditional well being
theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire
satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for
cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a
critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper
refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which
evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being
with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this
framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends
on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather
than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the
paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of
group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions
akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables
semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions,
allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and
group flourishing over time.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of
AI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to
global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem
scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of
professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable
applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent
(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in
scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA
framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a
blind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of
real-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.

Method: 分析计算图并提出基于操作重排序的整数化过程，延迟反量化至矩阵运算后，实现整数化矩阵乘法和线性模块。

Result: 实验表明，低比特推理降低了线性层和矩阵乘法的每处理单元功耗。

Conclusion: 该方法缩小了量化模型与高效推理之间的差距。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across
various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs.
While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these
models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization
before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and
propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically,
the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables
integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the
quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention
module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show
that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer
and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and
efficient inference.

Motivation: DNN对抗样本的脆弱性引发了对安全关键任务可靠性的担忧，现有评估方法存在依赖攻击算法、耗时或难以实现的问题。

Method: 基于样本聚类特征，分析决策边界分隔的特征向量类内和类间距离，量化模型鲁棒性。

Result: RDI与攻击成功率（ASR）相关性更强，计算时间仅为PGD攻击评估方法的1/30。

Conclusion: RDI是一种高效、攻击无关的对抗鲁棒性评估方法，适用于复杂模型。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples,
raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently,
methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into
attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not
only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming,
while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to
implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness
based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation
accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial
robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based
on sample clustering features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation
by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors
separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is
attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show
that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard
adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average
computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD
attack. Our open-source code is available at:

Conclusion: 策略性地复用预训练Transformer的中间层可以为野火风险管理等环境应用提供更高效和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially large Transformers, carry substantial
"memory" in their intermediate layers -- an \emph{internal world} that encodes
a wealth of relational and contextual knowledge. This work harnesses that
internal world for wildfire occurrence prediction by introducing a modular
architecture built upon Gemma 3, a state-of-the-art multimodal model. Rather
than relying on Gemma 3's original embedding and positional encoding stacks, we
develop a custom feed-forward module that transforms tabular wildfire features
into the hidden dimension required by Gemma 3's mid-layer Transformer blocks.
We freeze these Gemma 3 sub-layers -- thus preserving their pretrained
representation power -- while training only the smaller input and output
networks. This approach minimizes the number of trainable parameters and
reduces the risk of overfitting on limited wildfire data, yet retains the
benefits of Gemma 3's broad knowledge. Evaluations on a Moroccan wildfire
dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to
standard feed-forward and convolutional baselines. Ablation studies confirm
that the frozen Transformer layers consistently contribute to better
representations, underscoring the feasibility of reusing large-model mid-layers
as a learned internal world. Our findings suggest that strategic modular reuse
of pretrained Transformers can enable more data-efficient and interpretable
solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk
management.

### [238] [Understanding the Skill Gap in Recurrent Language Models: The Role of the Gather-and-Aggregate Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18574)
*Aviv Bick,Eric Xing,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer和SSM模型中的上下文检索机制，发现两者均采用Gather-and-Aggregate（G&A）机制，且集中在少数关键头部。禁用这些头部会显著降低模型性能，表明上下文检索可能掩盖任务的知识需求。SSM的检索挑战源于其G&A实现方式，但问题仅局限于少数头部，而非整个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer和SSM模型在上下文检索中的表现差异，揭示其共同的G&A机制及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析模型头部功能，禁用关键G&A头部，并比较其在MMLU、GSM8K等任务中的表现差异。

Result: 发现G&A机制集中在少数头部，禁用后模型性能显著下降（如MMLU准确率从66%降至25%）。SSM的检索问题源于其G&A实现方式。

Conclusion: 上下文检索的差异仅局限于少数头部，而非整个模型。这一发现为结合Transformer和SSM的优势提供了方向。

Abstract: SSMs offer efficient processing of long sequences with fixed state sizes, but
struggle with algorithmic tasks like retrieving past context. In this work, we
examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and
SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same
fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first
identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an
Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model
types, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks
even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example,
disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades
its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy
from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure
the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance
with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar
G&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the
significance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs
manifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns
rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus,
while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context
retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight
suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers
and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example,
in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of
Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&A
head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.

Result: TSiTPlus和XCMPlus表现最佳，分别用于小时和每日预测，误差较低。

Conclusion: 模型能准确预测等待人数，有助于改善急诊科资源分配和患者流动。

Abstract: Background: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding remains a major challenge,
causing delays in care and increased operational strain. Hospital management
often reacts to congestion after it occurs. Machine learning predictive
modeling offers a proactive approach by forecasting patient flow metrics, such
as waiting count, to improve resource planning and hospital efficiency.
  Objective: This study develops machine learning models to predict ED waiting
room occupancy at two time scales. The hourly model forecasts the waiting count
six hours ahead (e.g., a 1 PM prediction for 7 PM), while the daily model
estimates the average waiting count for the next 24 hours (e.g., a 5 PM
prediction for the following day's average). These tools support staffing
decisions and enable earlier interventions to reduce overcrowding.
  Methods: Data from a partner hospital's ED in the southeastern United States
were used, integrating internal metrics and external features. Eleven machine
learning algorithms, including traditional and deep learning models, were
trained and evaluated. Feature combinations were optimized, and performance was
assessed across varying patient volumes and hours.
  Results: TSiTPlus achieved the best hourly prediction (MAE: 4.19, MSE:
29.32). The mean hourly waiting count was 18.11, with a standard deviation of
9.77. Accuracy varied by hour, with MAEs ranging from 2.45 (11 PM) to 5.45 (8
PM). Extreme case analysis at one, two, and three standard deviations above the
mean showed MAEs of 6.16, 10.16, and 15.59, respectively. For daily

of 18.11 and standard deviation of 4.51.
  Conclusions: These models accurately forecast ED waiting room occupancy and
support proactive resource allocation. Their implementation has the potential
to improve patient flow and reduce overcrowding in emergency care settings.

*Feng Chen,Yefei He,Lequan Lin,Jing Liu,Bohan Zhuang,Qi Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZipR1是一种基于强化学习的后训练方法，通过优化推理效率与性能的权衡，显著减少MLLM的token比例，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏注意力机制通过选择性处理显著token减少计算开销，但如何主动鼓励token稀疏性以提升推理加速效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ZipR1方法，将token减少比例作为效率奖励，答案准确性作为性能奖励，联合优化计算和内存瓶颈。

Result: 实验显示，ZipR1能将Qwen2/2.5-VL的token比例从80%降至25%，在13个图像和视频基准测试中准确性损失极小。

Conclusion: ZipR1有效解决了推理效率与性能的权衡问题，为MLLM的加速提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead by
selectively processing a subset of salient tokens while preserving model
performance. Despite the effectiveness of such designs, how to actively
encourage token sparsity of well-posed MLLMs remains under-explored, which
fundamentally limits the achievable acceleration effect during inference. In
this paper, we propose a simple RL-based post-training method named
\textbf{ZipR1} that treats the token reduction ratio as the efficiency reward
and answer accuracy as the performance reward.
  In this way, our method can jointly alleviate the computation and memory
bottlenecks via directly optimizing the inference-consistent
efficiency-performance tradeoff. Experimental results demonstrate that ZipR1
can reduce the token ratio of Qwen2/2.5-VL from 80\% to 25\% with a minimal
accuracy reduction on 13 image and video benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA)的检查点合并方法，通过性能指标加权合并参数高效微调（PEFT）中的模型快照，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究检查点合并技术以减少大型语言模型的训练时间，并探索其在参数高效微调（PEFT）中的应用。

Method: 提出MWA方法，根据训练损失或训练步数对检查点参数进行加权合并，引入惩罚因子调整权重分布，仅需一个超参数。

Result: 在数学推理、偏好对齐和通用指令调优任务中，MWA生成的合并模型性能优于均匀平均合并，损失加权合并效果最佳，任务准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: 验证了检查点合并对PEFT的有效性，表明基于指标的加权启发式方法能以最小计算开销高效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Checkpoint merging is a technique for combining multiple model snapshots into
a single superior model, potentially reducing training time for large language
models. This paper explores checkpoint merging in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), where only small adapter modules (e.g.
LoRA) are trained. We propose Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA), a simple yet
effective method to merge model checkpoints by weighting their parameters
according to performance metrics. In particular, we investigate weighting by
training loss and by training steps, under the intuition that lower-loss or
later-step checkpoints are more valuable. We introduce a formula with a penalty
factor to adjust weight distribution, requiring only one hyperparameter
regardless of the number of checkpoints. Experiments on three fine-tuning tasks
(mathematical reasoning, preference alignment, and general instruction tuning)
show that MWA consistently produces merged models that outperform the naive
uniform average of checkpoints. Notably, loss-weighted merging often yields the
best results, delivering up to 5% higher task accuracy than the baseline
uniform merge and even surpassing the final individual checkpoint's
performance. These findings validate checkpoint merging for PEFT and
demonstrate that a metric-driven weighting heuristic can efficiently boost
model performance with minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: PARD是一种新型的推测解码方法，通过并行预测多个未来令牌和条件丢弃令牌技术，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在草稿阶段的开销和草稿模型的训练成本限制了效率和适应性。

Method: PARD采用并行草稿模型和条件丢弃令牌技术，实现单次前向预测多令牌，并降低训练成本。

Result: PARD将LLaMA3.1-8B的推理速度提升4.08倍，达到311.5令牌/秒。

Conclusion: PARD通过并行化和条件丢弃令牌技术，显著提升了LLM的推理效率和适应性。

Abstract: The autoregressive nature of large language models (LLMs) limits inference
speed. Each forward pass generates only a single token and is often
bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Speculative decoding alleviates this issue
using a draft-then-verify approach to accelerate token generation. However, the
overhead introduced during the draft phase and the training cost of the draft
model limit the efficiency and adaptability of speculative decoding. In this
work, we introduce PARallel Draft (PARD), a novel speculative decoding method
that enables low-cost adaptation of autoregressive draft models into parallel
draft models. PARD enhances inference efficiency by predicting multiple future
tokens in a single forward pass of the draft phase, and incorporates a
conditional drop token method to accelerate training. Its target-independence
property allows a single draft model to be applied to an entire family of
different models, minimizing the adaptation cost. Our proposed conditional drop
token method can improves draft model training efficiency by 3x. On our
optimized inference framework, PARD accelerates LLaMA3.1-8B inference by 4.08x,
achieving 311.5 tokens per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法（如PPO和GRPO）依赖复杂的权重和启发式剪枝，而EM Policy Gradient旨在提供一种更简单、更原则性的方法。

Method: 将推理任务建模为期望最大化（EM）优化问题，交替采样多样化的推理轨迹并进行奖励引导的微调。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH（HARD）数据集上表现优异，性能与GRPO相当或略优，同时具有更好的可扩展性和简洁性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了LLM推理的性能，还增强了其可解释性和鲁棒性，展示了在智能代理等领域的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, foundation models such as OpenAI's O1 and O3, along with DeepSeek's
R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capacities and problem-solving skills
acquired through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), with wide
applications in mathematics, coding, science, intelligent agents, and virtual
assistants. In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing
expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between
sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided
fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and
heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy
policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining
strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the
GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or
slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional
advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover,
models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as
sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting
its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 随着用户和服务数量的增加，大量未观测的QoS数据影响用户选择服务，需准确预测这些数据以理解用户行为和服务状况。

Method: 设计了雪花核心张量增强模型学习能力，并采用SLF-NMUT方法进行参数学习。

Result: 模型能更准确地学习动态用户-服务交互模式，提升缺失QoS数据的预测效果。

Conclusion: 非负雪花张量分解模型在预测动态QoS数据方面表现优异。

Abstract: Dynamic quality of service (QoS) data exhibit rich temporal patterns in
user-service interactions, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding
of user behavior and service conditions in Web service. As the number of users
and services increases, there is a large amount of unobserved QoS data, which
significantly affects users'choice of services. To predict unobserved QoS data,
we propose a Non-negative Snowflake Factorization of tensors model. This method
designs a snowflake core tensor to enhance the model's learning capability.
Additionally, it employs a single latent factor-based, nonnegative
multiplication update on tensor (SLF-NMUT) for parameter learning. Empirical
results demonstrate that the proposed model more accurately learns dynamic
user-service interaction patterns, thereby yielding improved predictions for
missing QoS data.

Motivation: 现有神经场方法在解决偏微分方程时对几何变化的处理能力有限，需要一种能够高效耦合几何与物理的方法。

Method: 使用编码器将输入几何编码为潜在点云嵌入，结合全局参数并通过解码器生成连续输出场，利用局部性和平移不变性偏置。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Fields have enabled powerful,
discretization-invariant methods for learning neural operators that approximate
solutions of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on general geometries.
Building on these developments, we introduce enf2enf, an encoder--decoder
methodology for predicting steady-state Partial Differential Equations with
non-parameterized geometric variability, based on recently proposed Equivariant
Neural Field architectures. In enf2enf, input geometries are encoded into
latent point cloud embeddings that inherently preserve geometric grounding and
capture local phenomena. The resulting representations are then combined with
global parameters and directly decoded into continuous output fields, thus
efficiently modeling the coupling between geometry and physics. By leveraging
the inductive biases of locality and translation invariance, our approach is
able to capture fine-scale physical features as well as complex shape
variations, thereby enhancing generalization and physical compliance. Extensive
experiments on a high-fidelity aerodynamic dataset, a hyper-elastic material
benchmark, and multi-element airfoil geometries, demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art
graph based, operator learning, and neural field methods. Notably, our method
supports real time inference and zero-shot super-resolution, enabling efficient
training on low-resolution meshes while maintaining high accuracy on full-scale
discretizations.

Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a significant global
health burden, where precise severity assessment is particularly critical for
effective clinical management in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. This study
introduces an innovative machine learning framework for COPD severity
classification utilizing the MIMIC-III critical care database, thereby
expanding the applications of artificial intelligence in critical care
medicine. Our research developed a robust classification model incorporating
key ICU parameters such as blood gas measurements and vital signs, while
implementing semi-supervised learning techniques to effectively utilize
unlabeled data and enhance model performance. The random forest classifier
emerged as particularly effective, demonstrating exceptional discriminative
capability with 92.51% accuracy and 0.98 ROC AUC in differentiating between
mild-to-moderate and severe COPD cases. This machine learning approach provides
clinicians with a practical, accurate, and efficient tool for rapid COPD
severity evaluation in ICU environments, with significant potential to improve
both clinical decision-making processes and patient outcomes. Future research
directions should prioritize external validation across diverse patient
populations and integration with clinical decision support systems to optimize
COPD management in critical care settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在目标攻击场景下的攻击成功率较低，对抗样本容易过拟合替代模型。

Method: 提出MCD方法，通过DropConnect在每次优化迭代中生成多样化的替代模型变体。

Result: 在CNN到Transformer的迁移场景中，MCD的平均攻击成功率比现有方法高13%。

Conclusion: MCD通过增强变体多样性并保留语义信息，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性和攻击性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of transfer-based black-box attack, where adversarial
samples generated using a single surrogate model are directly applied to target
models. Compared with untargeted attacks, existing methods still have lower
Attack Success Rates (ASRs) in the targeted setting, i.e., the obtained
adversarial examples often overfit the surrogate model but fail to mislead
other models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the pixels or features in
these adversarial examples collaborate in a highly dependent manner to maximize
the success of an adversarial attack on the surrogate model, which we refer to
as perturbation co-adaptation. Then, we propose to Mitigate perturbation
Co-adaptation by DropConnect (MCD) to enhance transferability, by creating
diverse variants of surrogate model at each optimization iteration. We conduct
extensive experiments across various CNN- and Transformer-based models to
demonstrate the effectiveness of MCD. In the challenging scenario of
transferring from a CNN-based model to Transformer-based models, MCD achieves
13% higher average ASRs compared with state-of-the-art baselines. MCD boosts
the performance of self-ensemble methods by bringing in more diversification
across the variants while reserving sufficient semantic information for each
variant. In addition, MCD attains the highest performance gain when scaling the
compute of crafting adversarial examples.

Abstract: Environmental biotechnologies, such as drinking water biofilters, rely on
complex interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding
physical-chemical environments. Predicting the performance of these systems is
challenging due to high-dimensional, sparse datasets that lack diversity and
fail to fully capture system behaviour. Accurate predictive models require
innovative, science-guided approaches. In this study, we present the first
application of Buckingham Pi theory to modelling biofilter performance. This
dimensionality reduction technique identifies meaningful, dimensionless
variables that enhance predictive accuracy and improve model interpretability.
Using these variables, we developed the Environmental Buckingham Pi Neural
Network (EnviroPiNet), a physics-guided model benchmarked against traditional
data-driven methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
autoencoder neural networks. Our findings demonstrate that the EnviroPiNet
model achieves an R^2 value of 0.9236 on the testing dataset, significantly
outperforming PCA and autoencoder methods. The Buckingham Pi variables also
provide insights into the physical and chemical relationships governing
biofilter behaviour, with implications for system design and optimization. This
study highlights the potential of combining physical principles with AI
approaches to model complex environmental systems characterized by sparse,
high-dimensional datasets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性、适应性和计算效率上优于KS测试、Wasserstein距离和PSI。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为实时数据漂移检测提供了高效解决方案，并在多维数据中展示了HTM的潜力。

Abstract: Data Drift is the phenomenon where the generating model behind the data
changes over time. Due to data drift, any model built on the past training data
becomes less relevant and inaccurate over time. Thus, detecting and controlling
for data drift is critical in machine learning models. Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM) is a machine learning model developed by Jeff Hawkins, inspired by
how the human brain processes information. It is a biologically inspired model
of memory that is similar in structure to the neocortex, and whose performance
is claimed to be comparable to state of the art models in detecting anomalies
in time series data. Another unique benefit of HTMs is its independence from
training and testing cycle; all the learning takes place online with streaming
data and no separate training and testing cycle is required. In sequential
learning paradigm, Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) offers some unique
benefit for online learning and inference. This paper proposes a novel hybrid
framework combining HTM and SPRT for real-time data drift detection and anomaly
identification. Unlike existing data drift methods, our approach eliminates
frequent retraining and ensures low false positive rates. HTMs currently work
with one dimensional or univariate data. In a second study, we also propose an
application of HTM in multidimensional supervised scenario for anomaly
detection by combining the outputs of multiple HTM columns, one for each
dimension of the data, through a neural network. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional drift detection
techniques like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Wasserstein distance, and
Population Stability Index (PSI) in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and
computational efficiency. Our experiments also provide insights into optimizing
hyperparameters for real-time deployment in domains such as Telecom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Xeno-Canto音频库中每个录音仅标注一个鸟类物种，但常包含其他声音，导致标签噪声，影响机器学习模型的准确性。

Method: 采用音频预处理、降维（卷积自编码器和变分深度嵌入）和无监督异常检测来清理数据集。

Result: 方法对大多数鸟类数据集有效，但不同物种间效果差异显著。

Conclusion: 清理过程能有效减少标签噪声，但效果因物种而异。

Abstract: The Xeno-Canto bird audio repository is an invaluable resource for those
interested in vocalizations and other sounds made by birds around the world.
This is particularly the case for machine learning researchers attempting to
improve on the bird species recognition accuracy of classification models.
However, the task of extracting labeled datasets from the recordings found in
this crowd-sourced repository faces several challenges. One challenge of
particular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird
species label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds
are also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds,
anthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds
can result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In
this work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing
followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD)
to reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We
investigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two
flavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE
(Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at
detecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant
variation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next. We
believe that the results of this investigation demonstrate that the application
of our cleaning process can meaningfully reduce the label noise of bird species
datasets derived from Xeno-Canto audio repository but results vary across
species.

Result: 自编码器生成的嵌入保留了数据结构，且聚类更紧凑，减少了所需标注样本的数量。

Conclusion: 无监督自编码器在ICESat-2数据中具有潜力，可减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: The Ice, Cloud, and Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides high-resolution
measurements of sea ice height. Recent studies have developed machine learning
methods on ICESat-2 data, primarily focusing on surface type classification.
However, the heavy reliance on manually collected labels requires significant
time and effort for supervised learning, as it involves cross-referencing track
measurements with overlapping background optical imagery. Additionally, the
coincidence of ICESat-2 tracks with background images is relatively rare due to
the different overpass patterns and atmospheric conditions. To address these
limitations, this study explores the potential of unsupervised autoencoder on
unlabeled data to derive latent embeddings. We develop autoencoder models based
on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to
reconstruct topographic sequences from ICESat-2 and derive embeddings. We then
apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to reduce dimensions
and visualize the embeddings. Our results show that embeddings from
autoencoders preserve the overall structure but generate relatively more
compact clusters compared to the original ICESat-2 data, indicating the
potential of embeddings to lessen the number of required labels samples.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂多模态分布下表现优于传统直方图方法。

Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in
statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best
modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal
patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms
often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying
distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of
histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as
gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant
analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for
multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes
minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach
builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic
decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean
classification dataset.

Conclusion: 原型网络在少量标记数据下表现更稳健，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Despite the ample availability of graph data, obtaining vertex labels is a
tedious and expensive task. Therefore, it is desirable to learn from a few
labeled vertices only. Existing few-shot learners assume a class oracle, which
provides labeled vertices for a desired class. However, such an oracle is not
available in a real-world setting, i.e., when drawing a vertex for labeling it
is unknown to which class the vertex belongs. Few-shot learners are often
combined with prototypical networks, while classical semi-supervised vertex
classification uses discriminative models, e.g., Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN). In this paper, we train our models by iteratively prompting a human
annotator with vertices to annotate. We perform three experiments where we
continually relax our assumptions. First, we assume a class oracle, i.e., the
human annotator is provided with an equal number of vertices to label for each
class. We denote this as "Balanced Sampling''. In the subsequent experiment,
"Unbalanced Sampling,'' we replace the class oracle with $k$-medoids clustering
and draw vertices to label from the clusters. In the last experiment, the
"Unknown Number of Classes,'' we no longer assumed we knew the number and
distribution of classes. Our results show that prototypical models outperform
discriminative models in all experiments when fewer than $20$ samples per class
are available. While dropping the assumption of the class oracle for the
"Unbalanced Sampling'' experiment reduces the performance of the GCN by $9\%$,
the prototypical network loses only $1\%$ on average. For the "Unknown Number
of Classes'' experiment, the average performance for both models decreased
further by $1\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决天气中心从大量观测数据中识别当前大气状态的挑战性问题。

Method: 使用1.5B参数的时空潜在扩散模型，基于ERA5再分析数据训练，支持多种观测条件。

Result: 实验显示物理一致性良好，重建效果优秀，预报能力有竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于分数的数据同化为未来全球大气建模系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed weather forecasting by improving both its
accuracy and computational efficiency. However, before any forecast can begin,
weather centers must identify the current atmospheric state from vast amounts
of observational data. To address this challenging problem, we introduce Appa,
a score-based data assimilation model producing global atmospheric trajectories
at 0.25-degree resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 1.5B-parameter
spatio-temporal latent diffusion model trained on ERA5 reanalysis data, Appa
can be conditioned on any type of observations to infer the posterior
distribution of plausible state trajectories, without retraining. Our unified
probabilistic framework flexibly tackles multiple inference tasks --
reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting -- using the same model, eliminating the
need for task-specific architectures or training procedures. Experiments
demonstrate physical consistency on a global scale and good reconstructions
from observations, while showing competitive forecasting skills. Our results
establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for
future global atmospheric modeling systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发一种高效且资源节约的低秩适应方法，以减少训练参数并保持性能。

Method: 将权重更新分解为三个矩阵（两个固定随机矩阵和一个可训练矩阵），并引入可学习的层间缩放因子。

Result: 在GLUE基准测试中，TLoRA性能与现有低秩方法（如LoRA）相当，但训练参数显著减少。

Conclusion: TLoRA是一种高效且有效的LLM微调方法，为资源高效的模型适应提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We propose TLoRA, a novel tri-matrix low-rank adaptation method that
decomposes weight updates into three matrices: two fixed random matrices and
one trainable matrix, combined with a learnable, layer-wise scaling factor.
This tri-matrix design enables TLoRA to achieve highly efficient parameter
adaptation while introducing minimal additional computational overhead. Through
extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark, we demonstrate that TLoRA achieves
comparable performance to existing low-rank methods such as LoRA and
Adapter-based techniques, while requiring significantly fewer trainable
parameters. Analyzing the adaptation dynamics, we observe that TLoRA exhibits
Gaussian-like weight distributions, stable parameter norms, and scaling factor
variability across layers, further highlighting its expressive power and
adaptability. Additionally, we show that TLoRA closely resembles LoRA in its
eigenvalue distributions, parameter norms, and cosine similarity of updates,
underscoring its ability to effectively approximate LoRA's adaptation behavior.
Our results establish TLoRA as a highly efficient and effective fine-tuning
method for LLMs, offering a significant step forward in resource-efficient
model adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文首次对异步实现的平均奖励Q学习的最后迭代收敛性进行了有限时间分析，证明了自适应步长的必要性及其重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究异步Q学习算法的收敛性，特别是自适应步长对收敛的影响。

Method: 采用自适应步长作为局部时钟，结合中心化步骤，分析其非马尔可夫随机逼近（SA）特性。

Result: 算法在均方意义下以O(1/k)速率收敛到最优相对Q函数，自适应步长是关键。

Conclusion: 自适应步长是异步Q学习收敛的必要条件，其分析方法对其他SA算法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This work presents the first finite-time analysis for the last-iterate
convergence of average-reward Q-learning with an asynchronous implementation. A
key feature of the algorithm we study is the use of adaptive stepsizes, which
serve as local clocks for each state-action pair. We show that the iterates
generated by this Q-learning algorithm converge at a rate of $O(1/k)$ (in the
mean-square sense) to the optimal relative Q-function in the span seminorm.
Moreover, by adding a centering step to the algorithm, we further establish
pointwise mean-square convergence to a centered optimal relative Q-function,
also at a rate of $O(1/k)$. To prove these results, we show that adaptive
stepsizes are necessary, as without them, the algorithm fails to converge to
the correct target. In addition, adaptive stepsizes can be interpreted as a
form of implicit importance sampling that counteracts the effects of
asynchronous updates.
  Technically, the use of adaptive stepsizes makes each Q-learning update
depend on the entire sample history, introducing strong correlations and making
the algorithm a non-Markovian stochastic approximation (SA) scheme. Our
approach to overcoming this challenge involves (1) a time-inhomogeneous
Markovian reformulation of non-Markovian SA, and (2) a combination of
almost-sure time-varying bounds, conditioning arguments, and Markov chain
concentration inequalities to break the strong correlations between the
adaptive stepsizes and the iterates. The tools developed in this work are
likely to be broadly applicable to the analysis of general SA algorithms with
adaptive stepsizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图神经网络（DGNN）主要依赖节点间成对交互，忽略了共同邻居的作用。

Method: HGNN-CNA通过多跳共同邻居估计相关性分数，并将其融入消息传递过程。

Result: 在三个真实动态图数据集上，HGNN-CNA显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HGNN-CNA通过直接考虑共同邻居交互，提升了链路预测的准确性。

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in dynamic graph learning (DGL),
inherently shaped by the topology of the DG. Recent advancements in dynamic
graph neural networks (DGNN), primarily by modeling the relationships among
nodes via a message passing scheme, have significantly improved link prediction
performance. However, DGNNs heavily rely on the pairwise node interactions,
which neglect the common neighbor interaction in DGL. To address this
limitation, we propose a High-order Graph Neural Networks with Common Neighbor
Awareness (HGNN-CNA) for link prediction with two-fold ideas: a) estimating
correlation score by considering multi-hop common neighbors for capturing the
complex interaction between nodes; b) fusing the correlation into the
message-passing process to consider common neighbor interaction directly in
DGL. Experimental results on three real DGs demonstrate that the proposed
HGNN-CNA acquires a significant accuracy gain over several state-of-the-art
models on the link prediction task.

TL;DR: 提出动态动作插值（DAI），一种简单通用的框架，通过时间变化权重插值专家和RL动作，显著提升强化学习的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）样本效率低，尤其在早期训练阶段，现有方法引入复杂架构和实现。

Method: DAI框架通过时间变化权重α(t)插值专家和RL动作，无需额外网络或损失函数。

Result: 实验显示DAI在MuJoCo任务中早期性能提升160%，最终性能提升50%，Humanoid任务早期提升4倍，收敛时提升2倍。

Conclusion: DAI证明无需复杂架构即可实现高效样本强化学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from severe sample inefficiency,
especially during early training, requiring extensive environmental
interactions to perform competently. Existing methods tend to solve this by
incorporating prior knowledge, but introduce significant architectural and
implementation complexity. We propose Dynamic Action Interpolation (DAI), a
universal yet straightforward framework that interpolates expert and RL actions
via a time-varying weight $\alpha(t)$, integrating into any Actor-Critic
algorithm with just a few lines of code and without auxiliary networks or
additional losses. Our theoretical analysis shows that DAI reshapes state
visitation distributions to accelerate value function learning while preserving
convergence guarantees. Empirical evaluations across MuJoCo continuous control
tasks demonstrate that DAI improves early-stage performance by over 160\% on
average and final performance by more than 50\%, with the Humanoid task showing
a 4$\times$ improvement early on and a 2$\times$ gain at convergence. These
results challenge the assumption that complex architectural modifications are
necessary for sample-efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 结论是XGB和MLP在不平衡数据集上表现更优，IterativeImputer填补方法复杂度高，适用于小规模数据。

Abstract: This work empirically evaluates machine learning models on two imbalanced
public datasets (KDDCUP99 and Credit Card Fraud 2013). The method includes data
preparation, model training, and evaluation, using an 80/20 (train/test) split.
Models tested include eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Multi Layer Perceptron
(MLP), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and
Multiple-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (MO-GAAL), with XGB
and MLP further combined with Random-Over-Sampling (ROS) and
Self-Paced-Ensemble (SPE). Evaluation involves 5-fold cross-validation and
imputation techniques (mean, median, and IterativeImputer) with 10, 20, 30, and
50 % missing data. Findings show XGB and MLP outperform generative models.
IterativeImputer results are comparable to mean and median, but not recommended

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于隐式神经表示的方法忽视了频域信息的潜在价值，导致性能不佳。

Method: FIT网络包含两个模块：FIM用于无损引入频域信息，FUSAM通过空间-频域交互和全局频域特性高效利用频域信息。

Result: 实验表明FIT在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法，FIM丰富了细节表征，IISA提高了频域保真度，FCSA有效捕获全局上下文。

Conclusion: FIT通过频域信息的引入和利用显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Methods based on implicit neural representation have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) tasks, but they neglect
the potential value of the frequency domain, leading to sub-optimal
performance. We proposes a novel network called Frequency-Integrated
Transformer (FIT) to incorporate and utilize frequency information to enhance
ASSR performance. FIT employs Frequency Incorporation Module (FIM) to introduce
frequency information in a lossless manner and Frequency Utilization
Self-Attention module (FUSAM) to efficiently leverage frequency information by
exploiting spatial-frequency interrelationship and global nature of frequency.
FIM enriches detail characterization by incorporating frequency information
through a combination of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with real-imaginary
mapping. In FUSAM, Interaction Implicit Self-Attention (IISA) achieves
cross-domain information synergy by interacting spatial and frequency
information in subspace, while Frequency Correlation Self-attention (FCSA)
captures the global context by computing correlation in frequency. Experimental
results demonstrate FIT yields superior performance compared to existing
methods across multiple benchmark datasets. Visual feature map proves the
superiority of FIM in enriching detail characterization. Frequency error map
validates IISA productively improve the frequency fidelity. Local attribution
map validates FCSA effectively captures global context.

<details>

Motivation: 大多数AI模型假设训练环境是平稳的，但在非平稳数据上表现不佳。现有方法通过数据平稳化会丢失趋势和季节性信息，而这些信息对学习时间依赖性至关重要。

Method: 结合差分、时间序列分解和潜在空间算术（LSA）技术，在变分自编码器（VAE）的潜在空间中存储趋势和季节性信息的嵌入。

Result: 在两个非平稳时间序列数据集上验证了方法的有效性，使用RMSE指标评估，四个深度学习模型均取得了与最先进技术竞争的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法成功保留了趋势和季节性信息，同时在非平稳数据上实现了高效的预测性能。

Abstract: AI models have garnered significant research attention towards predictive
task automation. However, a stationary training environment is an underlying
assumption for most models and such models simply do not work on non-stationary
data since a stationary relationship is learned. The existing solutions propose
making data stationary prior to model training and evaluation. This leads to
loss of trend and seasonal patterns which are vital components for learning
temporal dependencies of the system under study. This research aims to address
this limitation by proposing a method for enforcing stationary behaviour within
the latent space while preserving trend and seasonal information. The method
deploys techniques including Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and
Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), to learn information vital for efficient
approximation of trend and seasonal information which is then stored as
embeddings within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The
approach's ability to preserve trend and seasonal information was evaluated on
two time-series non-stationary datasets. For predictive performance evaluation,
four deep learning models were trained on the latent vector representations of
the datasets after application of the proposed method and all models produced
competitive results in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques using RMSE
as the performance metric.

Motivation: 传统系统辨识方法难以捕捉非线性动态，而深度学习模型缺乏不确定性量化，影响可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出区间神经网络（INNs）框架，通过区间算术生成预测区间（PIs），并扩展LSTM和Neural ODEs为区间版本（ILSTM和INODE）。

Result: 实验验证了ILSTM和INODE在系统辨识任务中的有效性，能够有效捕捉目标覆盖范围。

Conclusion: INNs为系统辨识提供了可靠的不确定性量化方法，扩展了深度学习在非线性动态建模中的应用。

Abstract: System Identification (SysID) is crucial for modeling and understanding
dynamical systems using experimental data. While traditional SysID methods
emphasize linear models, their inability to fully capture nonlinear dynamics
has driven the adoption of Deep Learning (DL) as a more powerful alternative.
However, the lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in DL-based models poses
challenges for reliability and safety, highlighting the necessity of
incorporating UQ. This paper introduces a systematic framework for constructing
and learning Interval Neural Networks (INNs) to perform UQ in SysID tasks. INNs
are derived by transforming the learnable parameters (LPs) of pre-trained
neural networks into interval-valued LPs without relying on probabilistic
assumptions. By employing interval arithmetic throughout the network, INNs can
generate Prediction Intervals (PIs) that capture target coverage effectively.
We extend Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs) into Interval LSTM (ILSTM) and Interval NODE (INODE)
architectures, providing the mathematical foundations for their application in
SysID. To train INNs, we propose a DL framework that integrates a UQ loss
function and parameterization tricks to handle constraints arising from
interval LPs. We introduce novel concept "elasticity" for underlying
uncertainty causes and validate ILSTM and INODE in SysID experiments,
demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: TFGD是一种高效且稳健的优化器，适用于理论和应用机器学习。

Abstract: This paper introduces Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent (TFGD), a novel
optimization framework that synergizes fractional calculus with exponential
tempering to enhance gradient-based learning. Traditional gradient descent
methods often suffer from oscillatory updates and slow convergence in
high-dimensional, noisy landscapes. TFGD addresses these limitations by
incorporating a tempered memory mechanism, where historical gradients are
weighted by fractional coefficients $|w_j| = \binom{\alpha}{j}$ and
exponentially decayed via a tempering parameter $\lambda$. Theoretical analysis
establishes TFGD's convergence guarantees: in convex settings, it achieves an
$\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate with alignment coefficient $d_{\alpha,\lambda} = (1 -
e^{-\lambda})^{-\alpha}$, while stochastic variants attain
$\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$ error decay. The algorithm maintains $\mathcal{O}(n)$
time complexity equivalent to SGD, with memory overhead scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(d/\lambda)$ for parameter dimension $d$. Empirical validation on
the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset demonstrates TFGD's superiority, achieving
98.25\% test accuracy (vs. 92.11\% for SGD) and 2$\times$ faster convergence.
The tempered memory mechanism proves particularly effective in medical
classification tasks, where feature correlations benefit from stable gradient
averaging. These results position TFGD as a robust alternative to conventional
optimizers in both theoretical and applied machine learning.

Abstract: We introduce a temporal feature encoding architecture called Time Series
Representation Model (TSRM) for multivariate time series forecasting and
imputation. The architecture is structured around CNN-based representation
layers, each dedicated to an independent representation learning task and
designed to capture diverse temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based
feature extraction layer and a merge layer, designed to aggregate extracted
features. The architecture is fundamentally based on a configuration that is
inspired by a Transformer encoder, with self-attention mechanisms at its core.
The TSRM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on most of the
seven established benchmark datasets considered in our empirical evaluation for
both forecasting and imputation tasks. At the same time, it significantly
reduces complexity in the form of learnable parameters. The source code is

Abstract: A primary challenge in ITE estimation is sample selection bias. Traditional
approaches utilize treatment regularization techniques such as the Integral
Probability Metrics (IPM), re-weighting, and propensity score modeling to
mitigate this bias. However, these regularizations may introduce undesirable
information loss and limit the performance of the model. Furthermore, treatment
effects vary across different external contexts, and the existing methods are
insufficient in fully interacting with and utilizing these contextual features.
To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware uplift model based on the
Two-Stage training approach (TSCAN), comprising CAN-U and CAN-D sub-models. In
the first stage, we train an uplift model, called CAN-U, which includes the
treatment regularizations of IPM and propensity score prediction, to generate a
complete dataset with counterfactual uplift labels. In the second stage, we
train a model named CAN-D, which utilizes an isotonic output layer to directly
model uplift effects, thereby eliminating the reliance on the regularization
components. CAN-D adaptively corrects the errors estimated by CAN-U through
reinforcing the factual samples, while avoiding the negative impacts associated
with the aforementioned regularizations. Additionally, we introduce a
Context-Aware Attention Layer throughout the two-stage process to manage the
interactions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features, thereby
modeling the varying treatment effect in different contexts. We conduct
extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness
of TSCAN. Ultimately, the deployment of our model for real-world merchant
diagnosis on one of China's largest online food ordering platforms validates
its practical utility and impact.

Abstract: Neuroimaging provides a critical framework for characterizing brain activity
by quantifying connectivity patterns and functional architecture across
modalities. While modern machine learning has significantly advanced our
understanding of neural processing mechanisms through these datasets, decoding
task-specific signatures must contend with inherent neuroimaging constraints,
for example, low signal-to-noise ratios in raw electrophysiological recordings,
cross-session non-stationarity, and limited sample sizes. This review focuses
on machine learning approaches for covariance-based neuroimaging data, where
often symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices under full-rank conditions
encode inter-channel relationships. By equipping the space of SPD matrices with
Riemannian metrics (e.g., affine-invariant or log-Euclidean), their space forms
a Riemannian manifold enabling geometric analysis. We unify methodologies
operating on this manifold under the SPD learning framework, which
systematically leverages the SPD manifold's geometry to process covariance
features, thereby advancing brain imaging analytics.

Abstract: Integrating various data modalities brings valuable insights into underlying
phenomena. Multimodal factor analysis (FA) uncovers shared axes of variation
underlying different simple data modalities, where each sample is represented
by a vector of features. However, FA is not suited for structured data
modalities, such as text or single cell sequencing data, where multiple data
points are measured per each sample and exhibit a clustering structure. To
overcome this challenge, we introduce FACTM, a novel, multi-view and
multi-structure Bayesian model that combines FA with correlated topic modeling
and is optimized using variational inference. Additionally, we introduce a
method for rotating latent factors to enhance interpretability with respect to
binary features. On text and video benchmarks as well as real-world music and
COVID-19 datasets, we demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in
identifying clusters in structured data, and integrating them with simple
modalities via the inference of shared, interpretable factors.

### [272] [Revisiting Transformers through the Lens of Low Entropy and Dynamic Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18929)
*Ruifeng Ren,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers在数据压缩中表现出独特的归纳偏好，倾向于学习低熵分布，且模型越大偏好越强。FFN模块是驱动此偏好的关键。此外，模型参数中存在冗余，表现为动态稀疏性，但需进一步研究。大模型更倾向于通过残差连接绕过注意力计算，且训练不稳定性与神经元死亡相关。

Motivation: 探索Transformer在数据压缩中的表现，尤其是其与目标分布的差异及动态稀疏性，以更深入理解其工作原理。

Method: 在受控实验设置下，分析Transformer的压缩行为，包括熵偏好、FFN模块作用及动态稀疏性。

Result: Transformer倾向于学习低熵分布，FFN模块是关键驱动因素；参数冗余表现为动态稀疏性，大模型更倾向于绕过注意力计算。

Conclusion: 研究从熵和动态稀疏性角度深化了对Transformer的理解，揭示了其压缩行为的独特偏好及潜在机制。

Abstract: Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of
Transformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a
criterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often
remains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression
and to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of
the target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is
typically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In
this work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We
find that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:
beyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning
lower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the
model size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly
aligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its
information content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical
role in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational
redundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within
their parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through
dynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,
particularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for
this, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing
attention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of
active neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger
models strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work
contributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy
and dynamic sparsity.

Conclusion: 非学习型迭代优化器与机器学习模型一样对对抗样本敏感，但可通过对抗训练提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet
seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered
to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation
and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the
adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of
iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in
deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that
non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples
of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the
optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We
then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to
enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient
optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial
sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of
various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and
adversarial training.

Conclusion: $PINN方法在计算PDE全局不确定性方面高效且鲁棒，可扩展至其他域分解技术。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial
and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We
propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a
Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across
subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of
neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct
a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains.
Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be
seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer
that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local
uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can
be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding
uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for
different domain sizes.

Abstract: We study the Active Simple Hypothesis Testing (ASHT) problem, a simpler
variant of the Fixed Budget Best Arm Identification problem. In this work, we
provide novel game theoretic formulation of the upper bounds of the ASHT
problem. This formulation allows us to leverage tools of differential games and
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to propose an approximately optimal
algorithm that is computationally tractable compared to prior work. However,
the optimal algorithm still suffers from a curse of dimensionality and instead
we use a novel link to Blackwell Approachability to propose an algorithm that
is far more efficient computationally. We show that this new algorithm,
although not proven to be optimal, is always better than static algorithms in
all instances of ASHT and is numerically observed to attain the optimal

Conclusion: 这些方法为硬舍入提供了高效且可微分的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose novel smooth approximations to the classical rounding function,
suitable for differentiable optimization and machine learning applications. Our
constructions are based on two approaches: (1) localized sigmoid window
functions centered at each integer, and (2) normalized weighted sums of sigmoid
derivatives representing local densities. The first method approximates the
step-like behavior of rounding through differences of shifted sigmoids, while
the second method achieves smooth interpolation between integers via
density-based weighting. Both methods converge pointwise to the classical
rounding function as the sharpness parameter k tends to infinity, and allow
controlled trade-offs between smoothness and approximation accuracy. We
demonstrate that by restricting the summation to a small set of nearest
integers, the computational cost remains low without sacrificing precision.
These constructions provide fully differentiable alternatives to hard rounding,
which are valuable in contexts where gradient-based methods are essential.

Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative
measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary
biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive
sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to
elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each
sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in
multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires "gauge-fixing,"
i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has
established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique
solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized "weight
space" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish
the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight
space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in "function space," i.e.
the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We
disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the
learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We
also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit
Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive
the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process
posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be
efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally,
we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most
common weight space regularizers. Overall, our framework unifies and extends
our ability to infer and interpret sequence-function relationships.

Abstract: The growing demand for molecules with tailored properties in fields such as
drug discovery and chemical engineering has driven advancements in
computational methods for molecular design. Machine learning-based approaches
for de-novo molecular generation have recently garnered significant attention.
This paper introduces a transformer-based vector embedding generator combined
with a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate molecules with
desired properties. The embedding generator utilizes a novel molecular
descriptor, integrating Morgan fingerprints with global molecular attributes,
enabling the transformer to capture local functional groups and broader
molecular characteristics. Modifying the GAN generator loss function ensures
the generation of molecules with specific desired properties. The transformer
achieves a reconversion accuracy of 94% while translating molecular descriptors
back to SMILES strings, validating the utility of the proposed embeddings for
generative tasks. The approach is validated by generating novel odorant
molecules using a labeled dataset of odorant and non-odorant compounds. With
the modified range-loss function, the GAN exclusively generates odorant
molecules. This work underscores the potential of combining novel vector
embeddings with transformers and modified GAN architectures to accelerate the
discovery of tailored molecules, offering a robust tool for diverse molecular
design applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for density estimation that leverages an estimated

each data point is adjusted by taking a single step along the score function
with a specific choice of step size, followed by standard KDE with a modified
bandwidth. The step size and modified bandwidth are chosen to remove the
leading order bias in the KDE. Our experiments on synthetic tasks in 1D, 2D and
on MNIST, demonstrate that our proposed SD-KDE method significantly reduces the
mean integrated squared error compared to the standard Silverman KDE, even with
noisy estimates in the score function. These results underscore the potential
of integrating score-based corrections into nonparametric density estimation.

Conclusion: DRDFL框架有效平衡了个性化与泛化需求，提升了去中心化联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Ring-topology Decentralized Federated Learning (RDFL) for
distributed model training, aiming to avoid the inherent risks of centralized
failure in server-based FL. However, RDFL faces the challenge of low
information-sharing efficiency due to the point-to-point communication manner
when handling inherent data heterogeneity. Existing studies to mitigate data
heterogeneity focus on personalized optimization of models, ignoring that the
lack of shared information constraints can lead to large differences among
models, weakening the benefits of collaborative learning. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Divide-and-conquer RDFL framework (DRDFL) that uses a
feature generation model to extract personalized information and invariant
shared knowledge from the underlying data distribution, ensuring both effective
personalization and strong generalization. Specifically, we design a
\textit{PersonaNet} module that encourages class-specific feature
representations to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, facilitating the
learning of discriminative latent representations tailored to local data
distributions. Meanwhile, the \textit{Learngene} module is introduced to
encapsulate shared knowledge through an adversarial classifier to align latent
representations and extract globally invariant information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRDFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
various data heterogeneity settings.

Abstract: Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential
decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional
value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta
reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which
demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the
development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where
risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work
characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a
Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and
constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we
propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity
Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential
decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of
robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot
adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning
process under certain scenarios. Our project website is at

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) excel where phase matters, yet their
multi-sheeted decision surfaces defy standard explainability and calibration
tools. We propose a \emph{Newton-Puiseux} framework that fits a local
polynomial surrogate to a high-uncertainty input and analytically decomposes
this surrogate into fractional-power series. The resulting Puiseux expansions,
dominant Puiseux coefficients, and phase-aligned curvature descriptors deliver
closed-form estimates of robustness and over-confidence that gradient - or
perturbation-based methods (saliency, LIME, SHAP) cannot provide. On a
controlled $\mathbb{C}^2$ helix the surrogate attains RMSE $< 0.09$ while
recovering the number of decision sheets; quartic coefficients predict
adversarial flip radii within $10^{-3}$. On the real-world MIT-BIH arrhythmia
corpus, Puiseux-guided, phase-aware temperature scaling lowers expected
calibration error from 0.087 to 0.034, contributing to the advancement of

Abstract: Accurately identifying critical nodes with high spatial influence in road
networks is essential for enhancing the efficiency of traffic management and
urban planning. However, existing node importance ranking methods mainly rely
on structural features and topological information, often overlooking critical
factors such as origin-destination (OD) demand and route information. This
limitation leaves considerable room for improvement in ranking accuracy. To
address this issue, we propose HetGL2R, an attributed heterogeneous graph
learning approach for ranking node importance in road networks. This method
introduces a tripartite graph (trip graph) to model the structure of the road
network, integrating OD demand, route choice, and various structural features
of road segments. Based on the trip graph, we design an embedding method to
learn node representations that reflect the spatial influence of road segments.
The method consists of a heterogeneous random walk sampling algorithm
(HetGWalk) and a Transformer encoder. HetGWalk constructs multiple
attribute-guided graphs based on the trip graph to enrich the diversity of
semantic associations between nodes. It then applies a joint random walk
mechanism to convert both topological structures and node attributes into
sequences, enabling the encoder to capture spatial dependencies more
effectively among road segments. Finally, a listwise ranking strategy is
employed to evaluate node importance. To validate the performance of our
method, we construct two synthetic datasets using SUMO based on simulated road
networks. Experimental results demonstrate that HetGL2R significantly
outperforms baselines in incorporating OD demand and route choice information,
achieving more accurate and robust node ranking. Furthermore, we conduct a case
study using real-world taxi trajectory data from Beijing, further verifying the
practicality of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在概率单纯形上最小化KL散度的问题，比较了两种坐标系统下的梯度下降（GD）与自然梯度下降（NGD）的收敛行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL散度在概率机器学习中作为标准损失函数，但其优化性能受参数化选择影响。研究旨在分析不同坐标系统下梯度优化算法的收敛性。

Method: 在信息几何框架下，比较了指数族（θ坐标）和混合族（η坐标）中的欧几里得梯度下降（GD）与坐标不变的自然梯度下降（NGD）。

Result: 连续时间下，GD在θ和η坐标的收敛率分别为NGD的下界和上界；离散时间下，NGD表现更优，收敛更快且对噪声更鲁棒。

Conclusion: NGD在离散时间下具有明显优势，尽管连续时间下其收敛性不总是最优，但其鲁棒性和速度使其成为更优选择。

Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence plays a central role in probabilistic
machine learning, where it commonly serves as the canonical loss function.
Optimization in such settings is often performed over the probability simplex,
where the choice of parameterization significantly impacts convergence. In this
work, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the
behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate
systems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family
($\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\eta$ coordinates). We compare
Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the
coordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient
is a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the
parameter space. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence rates of GD
in the $\theta$ and $\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper bounds,
respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine
reparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in
$\eta$ and $\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\frac{2}{c}$,
respectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of
$2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them.
Although this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence
in continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in
discrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to
noise, outperforming GD. Our analysis hinges on bounding the spectrum and
condition number of the Hessian of the KL divergence at the optimum, which
coincides with the Fisher information matrix.

TL;DR: TeleSparse是一种ZK-SNARK友好的后处理机制，通过稀疏化和神经传送优化，显著降低了验证现代神经网络的资源开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证深度学习推理的完整性通常需要访问敏感数据或模型权重，而ZK-SNARKs可以解决这一问题，但应用于现代神经网络时计算开销巨大。

Method: TeleSparse通过稀疏化减少电路约束，并通过神经传送优化激活函数的范围，从而降低内存和证明生成成本。

Result: TeleSparse将证明内存使用减少67%，生成时间减少46%，准确率仅下降约1%。

Conclusion: TeleSparse为ZK友好的模型设计提供了新方向，推动了可扩展且资源高效的验证深度学习发展。

Abstract: Verification of the integrity of deep learning inference is crucial for
understanding whether a model is being applied correctly. However, such
verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially
sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct
Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the
capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data.
However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and
large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead.
  We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce
practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental
challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1)
Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous
constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation
costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models,
enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2)
Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by
optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation
for narrowing activation functions' range.
  TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by
46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We
implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its
effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet,
MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new
directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable,
resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.

Method: Anyprefer采用两玩家协作框架，引入外部工具和反馈机制优化数据合成。

Result: 生成58K高质量偏好对，实验显示在多个领域平均性能提升显著。

Conclusion: Anyprefer有效解决偏好数据质量问题，提升模型对齐效果。

Abstract: High-quality preference data is essential for aligning foundation models with
human values through preference learning. However, manual annotation of such
data is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a
self-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own
preference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model
shares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To
address these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize
high-quality preference data for aligning the target model. Anyprefer frames
the data synthesis process as a cooperative two-player Markov Game, where the
target model and the judge model collaborate together. Here, a series of
external tools are introduced to assist the judge model in accurately rewarding
the target model's responses, mitigating biases in the rewarding process. In
addition, a feedback mechanism is introduced to optimize prompts for both
models, enhancing collaboration and improving data quality. The synthesized
data is compiled into a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, consisting of 58K
high-quality preference pairs. Extensive experiments show that Anyprefer
significantly improves model alignment performance across four main
applications, covering 21 datasets, achieving average improvements of 18.55% in
five natural language generation datasets, 3.66% in nine vision-language
understanding datasets, 30.05% in three medical image analysis datasets, and
16.00% in four visuo-motor control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a ubiquitous concept in numerous
domains, including the legal system. AI has the potential to revolutionize the
functioning of the judiciary and the dispensation of justice. Incorporating AI
into the legal system offers the prospect of enhancing decision-making for
judges, lawyers, and legal professionals, while concurrently providing the
public with more streamlined, efficient, and cost-effective services. The
integration of AI into the legal landscape offers manifold benefits,
encompassing tasks such as document review, legal research, contract analysis,
case prediction, and decision-making. By automating laborious and error-prone
procedures, AI has the capacity to alleviate the burden associated with these
arduous tasks. Consequently, courts around the world have begun embracing AI
technology as a means to enhance the administration of justice. However,
alongside its potential advantages, the use of AI in the judiciary poses a
range of ethical challenges. These ethical quandaries must be duly addressed to
ensure the responsible and equitable deployment of AI systems. This article
delineates the principal ethical challenges entailed in employing AI within the
judiciary and provides recommendations to effectively address these issues.

Result: 在无条件图像生成、类条件图像生成和分子组装生成任务中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: K-Flow通过控制缩放参数，实现了生成分辨率的有效调控。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative learning paradigm, K-Flow, an
algorithm that flows along the $K$-amplitude. Here, $k$ is a scaling parameter
that organizes frequency bands (or projected coefficients), and amplitude
describes the norm of such projected coefficients. By incorporating the
$K$-amplitude decomposition, K-Flow enables flow matching across the scaling
parameter as time. We discuss three venues and six properties of K-Flow, from
theoretical foundations, energy and temporal dynamics, and practical
applications, respectively. Specifically, from the practical usage perspective,
K-Flow allows steerable generation by controlling the information at different
scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Flow, we conduct experiments on
unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and
molecule assembly generation. Additionally, we conduct three ablation studies
to demonstrate how K-Flow steers scaling parameter to effectively control the
resolution of image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LIFT方法在标签分布学习中表现不佳，因其仅关注簇内关系而忽略簇间交互，且依赖单一欧氏距离视角。

Method: 提出LIFT-SAP策略，结合距离和方向信息构建LSFs；开发LDL-LIFT-SAP算法，整合多LSF空间的预测结果。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上验证，LIFT-SAP优于LIFT，LDL-LIFT-SAP优于其他七种算法。

Conclusion: LIFT-SAP和LDL-LIFT-SAP通过多视角信息和簇间交互优化，显著提升了标签分布学习的效果。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is an emerging learning paradigm designed
to capture the relative importance of labels for each instance. Label-specific
features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks
with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label
to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks
can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect
intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct
clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information,
rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and
comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may
arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we
introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster
interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which
enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each
instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label
Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP),
which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF
spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as
well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other
well-established algorithms.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法显著提升了非线性双时间尺度随机逼近算法的收敛速度，适用于多种算法场景。

Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled
iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning,
optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean
square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best
known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In
this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear
two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such
as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key
step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an
averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an
induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.

Abstract: We introduce Hyperparameter Controller (HyperController), a computationally
efficient algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during training of
reinforcement learning neural networks. HyperController optimizes
hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement
learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It
achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown
Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly
changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter
objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step
predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the
performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer
during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of
OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments,
HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to
other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for
efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.

Result: 在多项选择数据集上，减少了向高成本模型的延迟，性能优于基线。

Conclusion: 双向延迟方法通过更全面的置信度估计，显著提升了模型级联的效率。

Abstract: Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but
powerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively
applying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to
largest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are
not sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited
small model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large
model, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore
propose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of
small and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy
for the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence
to enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to
improve post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves
cascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy
model to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the
proposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding
improvements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in
deferrals to more costly models.

Abstract: We consider a model of Bayesian observational learning in which a sequence of
agents receives a private signal about an underlying binary state of the world.
Each agent makes a decision based on its own signal and its observations of
previous agents. A central planner seeks to improve the accuracy of these
signals by allocating a limited budget to enhance signal quality across agents.
We formulate and analyze the budget allocation problem and propose two optimal
allocation strategies. At least one of these strategies is shown to maximize
the probability of achieving a correct information cascade.

Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for
localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as
thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting
for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the
immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data
assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of
machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an
already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in
the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel
method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast
precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to
learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a
generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series
data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial
research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67,
SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.

Abstract: Local clustering aims to identify specific substructures within a large graph
without requiring full knowledge of the entire graph. These substructures are
typically small compared to the overall graph, enabling the problem to be
approached by finding a sparse solution to a linear system associated with the
graph Laplacian. In this work, we first propose a method for identifying
specific local clusters when very few labeled data is given, which we term
semi-supervised local clustering. We then extend this approach to the
unsupervised setting when no prior information on labels is available. The
proposed methods involve randomly sampling the graph, applying diffusion
through local cluster extraction, then examining the overlap among the results
to find each cluster. We establish the co-membership conditions for any pair of
nodes and rigorously prove the correctness of our methods. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-arts results in the low-label rates regime.

Abstract: We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning from
high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable
values are missing. We suppose that the variables are missing not at random
(MNAR). The missingness model, denoted by $S(y)$, is the function that maps any
point $y$ in $R^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that are seen. In this
work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:
  (i) Self-censoring: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling the
true value $y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ with unknown
$\mu*$ and $\Sigma*$. For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i$
subseteq $R^d$ such that $x_i = y_i$ if and only if $y_i$ in $S_i$. Otherwise,
$x_i$ is missing and takes a generic value (e.g., "?"). We design an algorithm
that learns $N(\mu*, \Sigma*)$ up to total variation (TV) distance epsilon,
using $poly(d, 1/\epsilon)$ samples, assuming only that each pair of
coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.
  (ii) Linear thresholding: An observation $x$ is generated by first sampling
$y$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $N(\mu*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mu*$ and
known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $S$ where $S(y) = {i in
[d] : v_i^T y <= b_i}$ for some $v_1, ..., v_d$ in $R^d$ and $b_1, ..., b_d$ in
$R$. We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of
the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the
observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with
sufficiently high probability.

Conclusion: R-Sparse为高级LLMs提供了一种高效的训练无关稀疏方法，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating remarkable capabilities
across various applications, present significant challenges during inference
due to their substantial model size, especially when deployed on edge devices.
Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and
memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for
small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face
limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most
advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the
difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios
constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this
paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach
capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two
preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the
output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the
non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias
terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an
appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building
on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse
inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular
value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the
output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models
across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable
performance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43%
end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.

Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational
efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods,
especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential
equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator
Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the
neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary
geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a
sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring
invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to
variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated
with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The
performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing
its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and
arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.

*Donghe Chen,Han Wang,Lin Cheng,Shengping Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Soft Actor-Critic与Control Lyapunov Function的框架（SAC-CLF），旨在解决强化学习在现实应用中的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在控制任务中表现良好，但在现实应用中缺乏安全性保障，现有方法难以确保安全探索。

Method: SAC-CLF框架通过任务特定的CLF设计、动态约束调整和改进控制输入平滑性，增强稳定性和安全性。

Result: 在非线性系统和卫星姿态控制实验中，SAC-CLF有效克服了现有方法的不足。

Conclusion: SAC-CLF为强化学习在现实应用中的安全性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in control tasks but faces
significant challenges in real-world applications, primarily due to the absence
of safety guarantees during the learning process. Existing methods often
struggle with ensuring safe exploration, leading to potential system failures
and restricting applications primarily to simulated environments. Traditional
approaches such as reward shaping and constrained policy optimization can fail
to guarantee safety during initial learning stages, while model-based methods
using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) or Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) may
hinder efficient exploration and performance. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Soft Actor-Critic with Control Lyapunov Function
(SAC-CLF), a framework that enhances stability and safety through three key
innovations: (1) a task-specific CLF design method for safe and optimal
performance; (2) dynamic adjustment of constraints to maintain robustness under
unmodeled dynamics; and (3) improved control input smoothness while ensuring
safety. Experimental results on a classical nonlinear system and satellite
attitude control demonstrate the effectiveness of SAC-CLF in overcoming the
shortcomings of existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的奖励函数设计框架（PCRD），用于自动化生成强化学习（RL）中的奖励函数，以解决车队协调问题。该方法通过LLM驱动初始化和迭代优化，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车队协调问题中，手动设计奖励函数耗时且难以适应复杂目标，因此需要自动化方法。

Method: 提出PCRD框架，包含AIR模块（基于LLM初始化奖励函数）和进化模块（迭代优化），通过代码和任务理解减少幻觉风险。

Result: 在长江三角洲交通网络模拟中，PCRD生成的奖励函数比人工设计的性能平均高10%。

Conclusion: PCRD框架有效解决了奖励函数设计问题，为复杂协调任务提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated excellent decision-making
potential in platoon coordination problems. However, due to the variability of
coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the
time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well
performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon
coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define
the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based
cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward
function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model
(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which
systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven
initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first
initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements
with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively
optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR
module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a
chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code
generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward
function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence
stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging
coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River
Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results
demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions
consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average
of 10\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过调控LLM激活向量来改进推理能力的方法，无需额外训练即可提升特定任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM推理能力是否与其他信息处理任务类似，并验证是否可以通过干预激活向量来改进推理表现。

Method: 利用表示工程方法，从LLM残差流中提取激活向量，生成控制向量并在推理时干预模型表示空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提升Mistral-7B-Instruct和Pythia模型在归纳、演绎和数学推理任务中的表现。

Conclusion: LLM的推理能力可以通过简单的激活向量干预进行调控，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in
increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason.
Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is,
however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering
approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM
when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control
vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,
modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on
the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and
analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on
reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit
distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply
control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an
inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM
can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning
ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the
ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a
task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the
same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and
demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via
a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决未知时间偏微分方程（PDEs）动态系统的下一状态预测问题，利用数据中的结构化演化算子设计更高效方法。

Method: 使用超网络处理短轨迹生成小算子网络参数，通过时间积分预测下一状态，分离动态估计与状态预测。

Result: 在多样化物理数据集上预训练后，DISCO表现最优且训练周期少，下游任务微调后仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: DISCO框架高效且泛化性强，适用于未知PDEs动态系统的状态预测任务。

Abstract: We address the problem of predicting the next state of a dynamical system
governed by unknown temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) using only a
short trajectory. While standard transformers provide a natural black-box
solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in
the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when
the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state
accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we
introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short
trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network,
which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework
decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a
short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator).
Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets
achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer
epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned
on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出三种新方法（逆概率加权、序贯回归插补和序贯边际结构模型）来估计长期治疗效果，并针对数据稀疏问题提出BalanceNet方法以提高稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期治疗效果估计在多个领域有广泛应用，但现有研究很少关注单调缺失问题。

Method: 提出序贯缺失假设，并引入逆概率加权、序贯回归插补和序贯边际结构模型（SeqMSM）三种方法，进一步提出BalanceNet以解决SeqMSM的高方差问题。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文填补了单调缺失问题在长期治疗效果估计中的研究空白，提出的方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Estimating long-term treatment effects has a wide range of applications in
various domains. A key feature in this context is that collecting long-term
outcomes typically involves a multi-stage process and is subject to monotone
missing, where individuals missing at an earlier stage remain missing at
subsequent stages. Despite its prevalence, monotone missing has been rarely
explored in previous studies on estimating long-term treatment effects. In this
paper, we address this gap by introducing the sequential missingness assumption
for identification. We propose three novel estimation methods, including
inverse probability weighting, sequential regression imputation, and sequential
marginal structural model (SeqMSM). Considering that the SeqMSM method may
suffer from high variance due to severe data sparsity caused by monotone
missing, we further propose a novel balancing-enhanced approach, BalanceNet, to
improve the stability and accuracy of the estimation methods. Extensive
experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EDMC问题，提出一种无需样本分割且具有全局收敛保证的算法。

Method: 采用APGD算法，基于Burer-Monteiro分解，通过新的上界替代随机图引理。

Result: 在丰富样本区域表现出精确线性收敛，但在样本有限时性能下降。

Conclusion: APGD在理论预测范围内表现良好，但样本需求可能高于信息论极限。

Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on
Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent
(APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean
distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC)
problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show
for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of
this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log
n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike
leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local
curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our
proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC
setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate
exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast
when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress
function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if
the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical
prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of
implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the
stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more
samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.

Conclusion: JMP-L模型存在过参数化问题，压缩后的轻量版本在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为分子和材料发现提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have
improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer
training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation
model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with
reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages,
fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale
requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we
investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while
preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze
the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide
diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We
explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and
evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our
analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal
performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference
throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and
that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with
lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter,
faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials
discovery. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: This paper proposes a parameter collaborative optimization algorithm for
large language models, enhanced with graph spectral analysis. The goal is to
improve both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training.
In the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are
treated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian
spectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and
structural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a
joint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral
regularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters. In
addition, a spectral filtering mechanism is introduced during the optimization
phase. This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing
the model's training stability and convergence behavior. The method is
evaluated on multiple tasks, including traditional fine-tuning comparisons,
few-shot generalization tests, and convergence speed analysis. In all settings,
the proposed approach demonstrates superior performance. The experimental
results confirm that the spectral collaborative optimization framework
effectively reduces parameter perturbations and improves fine-tuning quality
while preserving overall model performance. This work contributes significantly
to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing parameter-efficient
training methodologies for large-scale models, reinforcing the importance of
structural signal processing in deep learning optimization, and offering a
robust, generalizable framework for enhancing language model adaptability and
performance.

Result: ESS提供了高度可解释的测量，可用于改进初始化策略、设计正则化方法，并通过模型蒸馏提升性能效率。

Conclusion: ESS揭示了内存利用的动态特性，有助于设计更高效的序列模型。

Abstract: The need to develop a general framework for architecture analysis is becoming
increasingly important, given the expanding design space of sequence models. To
this end, we draw insights from classical signal processing and control theory,
to develop a quantitative measure of \textit{memory utilization}: the internal
mechanisms through which a model stores past information to produce future
outputs. This metric, which we call \textbf{\textit{effective state-size}}
(ESS), is tailored to the fundamental class of systems with
\textit{input-invariant} and \textit{input-varying linear operators},
encompassing a variety of computational units such as variants of attention,
convolutions, and recurrences. Unlike prior work on memory utilization, which
either relies on raw operator visualizations (e.g. attention maps), or simply
the total \textit{memory capacity} (i.e. cache size) of a model, our metrics
provide highly interpretable and actionable measurements. In particular, we
show how ESS can be leveraged to improve initialization strategies, inform
novel regularizers and advance the performance-efficiency frontier through
model distillation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect of context
delimiters (such as end-of-speech tokens) on ESS highlights cross-architectural
differences in how large language models utilize their available memory to
recall information. Overall, we find that ESS provides valuable insights into
the dynamics that dictate memory utilization, enabling the design of more
efficient and effective sequence models.

Result: 实验表明，SCARLET在通信成本上减少50%，同时在准确性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCARLET是一种高效且适应性强的联邦学习框架，适用于多样化的客户端场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. Yet
conventional FL, relying on frequent parameter-sharing, suffers from high
communication overhead and limited model heterogeneity. Distillation-based FL
approaches address these issues by sharing predictions (soft-labels) instead,
but they often involve redundant transmissions across communication rounds,
reducing efficiency. We propose SCARLET, a novel framework integrating
synchronized soft-label caching and an enhanced Entropy Reduction Aggregation
(Enhanced ERA) mechanism. SCARLET minimizes redundant communication by reusing
cached soft-labels, achieving up to 50% reduction in communication costs
compared to existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Enhanced ERA can be
tuned to adapt to non-IID data variations, ensuring robust aggregation and
performance in diverse client scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that SCARLET consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation-based FL
methods in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency. The implementation
of SCARLET is publicly available at https://github.com/kitsuyaazuma/SCARLET.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated
remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses
significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization
performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to
evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes,
such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual
invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain
unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a
practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with
statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without
requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on
synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets,
including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach
aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard
baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic
systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical
step towards AI safety in healthcare. Code:

Result: 在CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet数据集上，LODAP精度提升4.32%，模型复杂性降低50%。

Conclusion: LODAP适用于边缘设备机器学习，显著提升效率与精度。

Abstract: Incremental learning that learns new classes over time after the model's
deployment is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly for industrial edge
systems, where it is difficult to communicate with a remote server to conduct
computation-intensive learning. As more classes are expected to learn after
their execution for edge devices. In this paper, we propose LODAP, a new
on-device incremental learning framework for edge systems. The key part of
LODAP is a new module, namely Efficient Incremental Module (EIM). EIM is
composed of normal convolutions and lightweight operations. During incremental
learning, EIM exploits some lightweight operations, called adapters, to
effectively and efficiently learn features for new classes so that it can
improve the accuracy of incremental learning while reducing model complexity as
well as training overhead. The efficiency of LODAP is further enhanced by a
data pruning strategy that significantly reduces the training data, thereby
lowering the training overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on the
CIFAR-100 and Tiny- ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that LODAP
improves the accuracy by up to 4.32\% over existing methods while reducing
around 50\% of model complexity. In addition, evaluations on real edge systems
demonstrate its applicability for on-device machine learning. The code is

that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving
superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN
performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally,
our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了高层次抽象与物理实现特性之间的鸿沟，显著提升了预测效率和准确性。

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) design space exploration (DSE) is an optimization
process in electronic design automation (EDA) that systematically explores
high-level design configurations to achieve Pareto-optimal hardware
implementations balancing performance, area, and power (PPA). To optimize this
process, HLS prediction tasks often employ message-passing neural networks
(MPNNs), leveraging complex architectures to achieve high accuracy. These
predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the
time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However,
existing models often prioritize structural complexity and minimization of
training loss, overlooking task-specific characteristics. Additionally, while
evolutionary algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require
extensive domain-specific knowledge to design effective crossover and mutation
operators. To address these limitations, we propose CoGNNs-LLMEA, a framework
that integrates a graph neural network with task-adaptive message passing and a
large language model-enhanced evolutionary algorithm. As a predictive model,
CoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source
code after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of
results (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to
tasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation
outcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and
physical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors
by 2.8$\times$ for latency and 3.4$\times$ for resource utilization compared to

Conclusion: 提出的设计在小型FPGA上高效加速DNN，适用于TinyML应用。

Abstract: The customizability of RISC-V makes it an attractive choice for accelerating
deep neural networks (DNNs). It can be achieved through instruction set
extensions and corresponding custom functional units. Yet, efficiently
exploiting these opportunities requires a hardware/software co-design approach
in which the DNN model, software, and hardware are designed together. In this
paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models
containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of
accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design
offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured
sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of
FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the
information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom
functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit
unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential
multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the
non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured
pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4,
respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types
of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5. Our designs consume a
small amount of additional FPGA resources such that the resulting co-designs
enable the acceleration of DNNs even on small FPGAs. We benchmark our designs
on standard TinyML applications such as keyword spotting, image classification,
and person detection.

### [318] [A Tripartite Perspective on GraphRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19667)
*Michael Banf,Johannes Kuhn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LLMs和三方知识图谱（Tripartite-GraphRAG）的新方法，以解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中的局限性，如幻觉和知识更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要事实准确性的领域（如工业自动化和医疗保健）表现不佳，主要问题包括幻觉、缺乏来源追溯性和知识更新困难。

Method: 通过将LLMs与三方知识图谱结合，利用领域特定概念和文本块的预分析构建知识图谱，并基于统计方法实现概念特定的相关性估计。

Result: 在医疗保健用例中，该方法优化了LLM提示的信息密度、覆盖范围和排列，同时减少了提示长度，提高了输出的可靠性和一致性。

Conclusion: Tripartite-GraphRAG方法有效解决了LLMs在知识密集型任务中的局限性，为实际应用提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that
demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key
limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability
(provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language
models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming
these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge
graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs
with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by
connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of
corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of
text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from
an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach
implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of
textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance
estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids
common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity
resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge
graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification
problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach
on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses
given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature. Experiments
indicate that it can optimize information density, coverage, and arrangement of
LLM prompts while reducing their lengths, which may lead to reduced costs and
more consistent and reliable LLM outputs.

Motivation: 现有图变换器忽略图的泛化偏差，仅从结构角度补偿性能不足，需结合频率信息优化。

Method: 利用图拉普拉斯矩阵特征值构建特征值矩阵掩码，结合逆傅里叶变换提取节点高低频特征，优化注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明Grafourierformer在图分类和节点分类任务中优于GNN和GT模型。

Conclusion: Grafourierformer通过结合结构信息和频率信息，有效提升模型性能，验证了方法的必要性和有效性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown advantages in numerous graph structure
tasks but their self-attention mechanism ignores the generalization bias of
graphs, with existing methods mainly compensating for this bias from aspects
like position encoding, attention bias and relative distance yet still having
sub-optimal performance and being insufficient by only considering the
structural perspective of generalization bias. To address this, this paper
proposes Grafourierformer, which innovatively combines GT with inductive bias
containing Frequency-Structure information by applying Graph Fourier Transform
to the Attention Matrix: specifically, eigenvalues from the Graph Laplacian
matrix are used to construct an Eigenvalue matrix mask (reflecting node
positions and structural relationships with neighboring nodes to enable
consideration of node range structural characteristics and focus on local graph
details), and inverse Fourier transform is employed to extract node
high-frequency and low-frequency features, calculate low-frequency and
high-frequency energy, and construct a node frequency-energy matrix to filter
the eigenvalue matrix mask, allowing attention heads to incorporate both graph
structural information and node frequency information optimization, adaptively
distinguish global trends from local details, and effectively suppress
redundant information interference. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
show Grafourierformer consistently outperforms GNN and GT-based models in graph
classification and node classification tasks, with ablation experiments further
validating the effectiveness and necessity of the method. Codes are available

TL;DR: FineQ是一种软硬件协同设计的低比特细粒度混合精度量化方法，用于减少大型语言模型的内存和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）对内存和计算资源需求高，现有量化方法在超低比特量化时精度下降严重，混合精度量化方法存在粒度粗、内存开销大或精度低的问题。

Method: FineQ将权重划分为细粒度簇，考虑异常值分布，提出簇内异常值保护机制和编码方案，并设计支持该算法的加速器。

Conclusion: FineQ通过软硬件协同设计，有效平衡了模型精度和内存开销，为LLMs的高效量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the natural language
processing paradigm but impose substantial demands on memory and computational
resources. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory
consumption of LLMs. However, advanced single-precision quantization methods
experience significant accuracy degradation when quantizing to ultra-low bits.
Existing mixed-precision quantization methods are quantized by groups with
coarse granularity. Employing high precision for group data leads to
substantial memory overhead, whereas low precision severely impacts model
accuracy. To address this issue, we propose FineQ, software-hardware co-design
for low-bit fine-grained mixed-precision quantization of LLMs. First, FineQ
partitions the weights into finer-grained clusters and considers the
distribution of outliers within these clusters, thus achieving a balance
between model accuracy and memory overhead. Then, we propose an outlier
protection mechanism within clusters that uses 3 bits to represent outliers and
introduce an encoding scheme for index and data concatenation to enable aligned
memory access. Finally, we introduce an accelerator utilizing temporal coding
that effectively supports the quantization algorithm while simplifying the
multipliers in the systolic array. FineQ achieves higher model accuracy
compared to the SOTA mixed-precision quantization algorithm at a close average
bit-width. Meanwhile, the accelerator achieves up to 1.79x energy efficiency
and reduces the area of the systolic array by 61.2%.

Motivation: 探讨VLM-CBMs在缺乏专家标注时，通过弱监督学习的概念质量及其影响。

Method: 使用VLM-CBMs架构，通过基础模型提供弱监督，并采用多种指标实证分析学习到的概念。

Result: VLM监督与专家标注存在显著差异，且概念准确性与质量无强相关性。

Conclusion: VLM-CBMs在概念学习上存在局限性，需进一步优化以提升概念质量。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are neural networks designed to conjoin high
performance with ante-hoc interpretability. CBMs work by first mapping inputs
(e.g., images) to high-level concepts (e.g., visible objects and their
properties) and then use these to solve a downstream task (e.g., tagging or
scoring an image) in an interpretable manner. Their performance and
interpretability, however, hinge on the quality of the concepts they learn. The
go-to strategy for ensuring good quality concepts is to leverage expert
annotations, which are expensive to collect and seldom available in
applications. Researchers have recently addressed this issue by introducing
"VLM-CBM" architectures that replace manual annotations with weak supervision
from foundation models. It is however unclear what is the impact of doing so on
the quality of the learned concepts. To answer this question, we put
state-of-the-art VLM-CBMs to the test, analyzing their learned concepts
empirically using a selection of significant metrics. Our results show that,
depending on the task, VLM supervision can sensibly differ from expert
annotations, and that concept accuracy and quality are not strongly correlated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brenier势在概率测度间的最优传输中起关键作用，但其统计学习理论尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过神经网络学习Brenier势。

Method: 使用ReCU网络（三次激活函数）逼近Brenier势，提出对抗训练方法，结合交叉熵损失和凸性惩罚项。

Result: 理论分析表明，高惩罚参数下网络严格凸，学习过程收敛。实验验证了网络能学习凸性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能有效学习Brenier势，为生成对抗网络在最优传输中的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Brenier proved that under certain conditions on a source and a target
probability measure there exists a strictly convex function such that its
gradient is a transport map from the source to the target distribution. This
function is called the Brenier potential. Furthermore, detailed information on
the H\"older regularity of the Brenier potential is available. In this work we
develop the statistical learning theory of generative adversarial neural
networks that learn the Brenier potential. As by the transformation of
densities formula, the density of the generated measure depends on the second
derivative of the Brenier potential, we develop the universal approximation
theory of ReCU networks with cubic activation $\mathtt{ReCU}(x)=\max\{0,x\}^3$
that combines the favorable approximation properties of H\"older functions with
a Lipschitz continuous density. In order to assure the convexity of such
general networks, we introduce an adversarial training procedure for a
potential function represented by the ReCU networks that combines the classical
discriminator cross entropy loss with a penalty term that enforces (strict)
convexity. We give a detailed decomposition of learning errors and show that
for a suitable high penalty parameter all networks chosen in the adversarial
min-max optimization problem are strictly convex. This is further exploited to
prove the consistency of the learning procedure for (slowly) expanding network
capacity. We also implement the described learning algorithm and apply it to a
number of standard test cases from Gaussian mixture to image data as target
distributions. As predicted in theory, we observe that the convexity loss
becomes inactive during the training process and the potentials represented by
the neural networks have learned convexity.

Result: 多数据集和架构实验显示性能提升，分子生成应用表现优异。

Conclusion: 新方法有效缓解过平滑，适用于分类和生成任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to be vulnerable to oversmoothing due
to their implicit homophily assumption. We mitigate this problem with a novel
scheme that regulates the aggregation of messages, modulating the type and
extent of message passing locally thereby preserving both the low and
high-frequency components of information. Our approach relies solely on learnt
embeddings, obviating the need for auxiliary labels, thus extending the
benefits of heterophily-aware embeddings to broader applications, e.g.,
generative modelling. Our experiments, conducted across various data sets and
GNN architectures, demonstrate performance enhancements and reveal heterophily
patterns across standard classification benchmarks. Furthermore, application to
molecular generation showcases notable performance improvements on
chemoinformatics benchmarks.

Conclusion: 模型大小扩展的收益递减，进一步进步需优化上下文设计；上下文理论为表征学习提供了统一框架和统计学习边界。

Abstract: This dissertation establishes the contexture theory to mathematically
characterize the mechanism of representation learning, or pretraining. Despite
the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear
what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for
various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning
is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is
producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is
imperative for further progress.
  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite
differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for
analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is
learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We
prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,
in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be
optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also
show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is
neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture
theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing
returns, and further advancements require better contexts.
  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,
including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,
etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning
the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an
effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove
statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss
the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream
task.

Abstract: Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for
capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data
sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic
integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural
Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled
uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single
end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and
estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to
higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing
mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial
perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on both node- and
graph-level tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a
probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and
formal robustness bounds. Finally, by incorporating recent advances in graph
contrastive learning, HU-GNN maintains diverse, structurally faithful
embeddings. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: Mj\"olnir不仅是有效的闪电参数化工具，还为下一代AI地球系统模型（AI-ESMs）提供了潜力方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet,
Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep
learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we
propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning
flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and
World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal
resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear
mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity.
The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a
multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and
magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the
global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of
lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96
for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as
an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a
promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法无法同时优化MSE和内积失真，且无法达到最优失真率。TurboQuant旨在解决这些问题，适用于在线应用。

Method: 通过随机旋转输入向量，利用高维坐标的独立性，对每个坐标应用最优标量量化器。针对内积偏置问题，采用两阶段量化策略：先MSE量化，再对残差应用1-bit QJL变换。

Result: TurboQuant接近理论下限（仅差约2.7倍），在KV缓存量化和最近邻搜索任务中表现优异，3.5比特/通道实现质量无损，2.5比特/通道质量下降极小。

Conclusion: TurboQuant在理论和实验中均表现出色，为向量量化提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims
to quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in
their geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared
error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing
methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious
algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion
rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.
TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a
concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the
near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply
apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that
MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a
two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL
(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product
quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower
bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,
demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a
small constant ($\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our
theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve
absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality
degradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search
tasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in
recall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.

Conclusion: 单头注意力机制在通用逼近能力上具有强大潜力，为理论研究和应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: We establish the universal approximation capability of single-layer,
single-head self- and cross-attention mechanisms with minimal attached
structures. Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input
domain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This
allows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates
the target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention
layer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating
any continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\infty$-norm.
Furthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable
function under $L_p$-norm for $1\leq p <\infty$. Lastly, we also extend our
techniques and show that, for the first time, single-head cross-attention
achieves the same universal approximation guarantees.

Method: 分析了三种框架：AsynFL（基本异步FL）、AsynFLC（带梯度压缩）和AsynFLC-EF（带EF），并改进了收敛分析。

Result: 异步延迟会放大压缩带来的方差，EF能有效减少方差，使AsynFLC-EF的收敛速度与AsynFL匹配。

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，表明EF在异步FL中具有重要作用，且异步延迟对EF的影响有限。

Abstract: Gradient compression is an effective technique for reducing communication
costs in federated learning (FL), and error feedback (EF) is usually adopted to
remedy the compression errors. However, there remains a lack of systematic
study on these techniques in asynchronous FL. In this paper, we fill this gap
by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different frameworks. We
firstly consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and provide an
improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and yields a
superior convergence rate than prior studies. Then, we consider a variant
framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC. We show sufficient conditions for
its convergence to the optimum, indicating the interaction between asynchronous
delay and compression rate. Our analysis also demonstrates that asynchronous
delay amplifies the variance caused by compression, thereby hindering
convergence, and such an impact is exacerbated by high data heterogeneity.
Furthermore, we study the convergence of AsynFLC-EF, the framework that further
integrates EF. We prove that EF can effectively reduce the variance of gradient
estimation despite asynchronous delay, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the
convergence rate of AsynFL. We also show that the impact of asynchronous delay
on EF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term.
Experimental results substantiate our analytical findings very well.

Abstract: Federated learning with heterogeneous data and personalization has received
significant recent attention. Separately, robustness to corrupted data in the
context of federated learning has also been studied. In this paper we explore
combining personalization for heterogeneous data with robustness, where a
constant fraction of the clients are corrupted. Motivated by this broad
problem, we formulate a simple instantiation which captures some of its
difficulty. We focus on the specific problem of personalized mean estimation
where the data is drawn from a Gaussian mixture model. We give an algorithm
whose error depends almost linearly on the ratio of corrupted to uncorrupted
samples, and show a lower bound with the same behavior, albeit with a gap of a
constant factor.

Abstract: Transfer learning enhances model performance by utilizing knowledge from
related domains, particularly when labeled data is scarce. While existing
research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in
independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer
learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by
the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates
random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its
features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local
dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning
algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along
with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains.
Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph
based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning
improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical
evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina
Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy,
particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于过程奖励模型（PRM）和生成流网络（GFlowNets）的方法，以提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学领域的准确性和推理多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在复杂领域（如数学）中准确性和推理多样性的挑战，避免依赖昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和相似性数据增强技术训练PRM，并利用GFlowNets在推理步骤级别生成多样且高质量的解决方案。

Result: 在数学基准测试中显著提升准确性和多样性（如MATH Level 5上Llama3.2-3B准确率提升2.59%），并在未见数据集上表现良好（SAT MATH提升9.4%）。

Conclusion: PRM引导的GFlowNets方法展示了提升LLMs数学推理能力的潜力，使其更稳健和多样化。

Abstract: Achieving both accuracy and diverse reasoning remains challenging for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in complex domains like mathematics. A key bottleneck is
evaluating intermediate reasoning steps to guide generation without costly
human annotations. To address this, we first introduce a novel Process Reward
Model (PRM) trained automatically using Monte Carlo Tree Search coupled with a
similarity-based data augmentation technique, effectively capturing step-level
reasoning quality. Leveraging this PRM, we then adapt Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to operate at the reasoning step level. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning focused on maximizing a single reward, GFlowNets
naturally sample diverse, high-quality solutions proportional to their rewards,
as measured by our PRM. Empirical evaluation shows strong improvements in both
accuracy and solution diversity on challenging mathematical benchmarks (e.g.,
+2.59% absolute accuracy on MATH Level 5 for Llama3.2-3B), with effective
generalization to unseen datasets (+9.4% absolute on SAT MATH). Our work
demonstrates the potential of PRM-guided, step-level GFlowNets for developing
more robust and versatile mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 探索在复杂数据分布和网络结构下，SGD如何学习信号方向，并揭示其动态过程中的关键过渡时间。

Method: 通过分析两层神经网络在均方误差（MSE）目标下的SGD动态，识别信号方向恢复的过渡时间，并研究幂律缩放下的损失缩放规律。

Result: 发现SGD动态中存在尖锐的过渡时间，且多个神经元的联合学习曲线导致累积目标的平滑缩放规律。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了SGD在复杂网络结构下的动态行为，为理解神经网络的训练过程提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the complexity of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for
learning a two-layer neural network with $P$ neurons on isotropic Gaussian
data: $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sum_{p=1}^P a_p\cdot
\sigma(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{v}_p^*\rangle)$, $\boldsymbol{x} \sim
\mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, where the activation
$\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an even function with information exponent
$k_*>2$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion),
$\{\boldsymbol{v}^*_p\}_{p\in[P]}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal
directions, and the non-negative second-layer coefficients satisfy $\sum_{p}
a_p^2=1$. We focus on the challenging ``extensive-width'' regime $P\gg 1$ and
permit diverging condition number in the second-layer, covering as a special
case the power-law scaling $a_p\asymp p^{-\beta}$ where
$\beta\in\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$. We provide a precise analysis of SGD dynamics for
the training of a student two-layer network to minimize the mean squared error
(MSE) objective, and explicitly identify sharp transition times to recover each
signal direction. In the power-law setting, we characterize scaling law
exponents for the MSE loss with respect to the number of training samples and
SGD steps, as well as the number of parameters in the student neural network.
Our analysis entails that while the learning of individual teacher neurons
exhibits abrupt transitions, the juxtaposition of $P\gg 1$ emergent learning
curves at different timescales leads to a smooth scaling law in the cumulative
objective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning
research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,
etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual
consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning
paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward
new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three
interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular
reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and
transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the
internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic
components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable
interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible
implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as
disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and
neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the
integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint
optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research
directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the
MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical
(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了交通预测的鲁棒性和精确性，有助于缓解拥堵和优化城市交通规划。

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation
systems, yet accurately forecasting traffic remains challenging due to the
interaction between long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Standard deep
learning models often struggle with these challenges because their
architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing
on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate
biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize
long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study
introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term
trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed
in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow
dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically
Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic
data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient
phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both
branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit
statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.
Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by
directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully
integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective
congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness
and precision of traffic prediction models.

Abstract: Circuit compilation, a crucial process for adapting quantum algorithms to
hardware constraints, often operates as a ``black box,'' with limited
visibility into the optimization techniques used by proprietary systems or
advanced open-source frameworks. Due to fundamental differences in qubit
technologies, efficient compiler design is an expensive process, further
exposing these systems to various security threats. In this work, we take a
first step toward evaluating one such challenge affecting compiler
confidentiality, specifically, reverse-engineering compilation methodologies.
We propose a simple ML-based framework to infer underlying optimization
techniques by leveraging structural differences observed between original and
compiled circuits. The motivation is twofold: (1) enhancing transparency in
circuit optimization for improved cross-platform debugging and performance
tuning, and (2) identifying potential intellectual property (IP)-protected
optimizations employed by commercial systems. Our extensive evaluation across
thousands of quantum circuits shows that a neural network performs the best in
detecting optimization passes, with individual pass F1-scores reaching as high
as 0.96. Thus, our initial study demonstrates the viability of this threat to
compiler confidentiality and underscores the need for active research in this
area.

Conclusion: 分布式块方法是一种有效的隐式正则化策略，有望提升量子机器学习模型的训练效率和实用性。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks hold promise for tackling computationally challenging
tasks that are intractable for classical computers. However, their practical
application is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from
complex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local
minima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits
increases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization
challenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical
data, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across
multiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent
quantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this
study, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss
landscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via
Hessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that
increasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss
landscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches
significantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding
suggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit
regularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing
generalization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization
challenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising
strategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning
models for classical data tasks.

Abstract: Social financial technology focuses on trust, sustainability, and social
responsibility, which require advanced technologies to address complex
financial tasks in the digital era. With the rapid growth in online
transactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility
prediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML)
models have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches
often encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to
complexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and
quantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently
processing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of
subtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in
noisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets.
To address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network
(QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that
optimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler
variational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection
and loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of
82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead.
Furthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its
robustness across various error conditions. Our findings highlight QFDNN
potential to enhance trust and security in social financial technology by
accurately detecting fraudulent transactions while supporting sustainability
through its resource-efficient design and minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 复杂微观结构材料（如TRMs）的应力分析中，相边界应力集中是关键问题，现有图像超分辨率技术缺乏物理约束，无法满足需求。

Conclusion: 该框架为相边界应力分析提供了有效工具，并展示了物理约束在超分辨率技术中的潜力。

Abstract: Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with
complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material
failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in
two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the
prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical
engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are
limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep
learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.
Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven
supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,
which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed
a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed
Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution
material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the
microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive
prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed
Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By
introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not
require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of
stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress
concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress
analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states
through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction
framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.

Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning

Conclusion: ML框架在软磁材料设计中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present a machine-learning guided approach to predict saturation
magnetization (MS) and coercivity (HC) in Fe-rich soft magnetic alloys,
particularly Fe-Si-B systems. ML models trained on experimental data reveals
that increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T
(DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and
structural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic
saturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T)
alloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent
with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased
electronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental
validation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model,
with good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed
uncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature
importance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a
nonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and
annealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such
as ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows. The ML framework was further
applied to Fe-Si-B/Cr/Cu/Zr/Nb alloys in a pseudo-quaternary compositional
space, which shows comparable magnetic properties to NANOMET

potential of ML framework for accelerated search of high-performance, Co- and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速确定材料中的结构-性能关联对理解基本机制和辅助材料设计至关重要，但现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 采用深度学习代理模型预测误差，主动采样未探索的结构-性能关系区域。

Result: 算法在预测性能方面优于随机采样。

Conclusion: 该算法为材料科学中高效映射结构-性能关系提供了便利工具。

Abstract: Rapidly determining structure-property correlations in materials is an
important challenge in better understanding fundamental mechanisms and greatly
assists in materials design. In microscopy, imaging data provides a direct
measurement of the local structure, while spectroscopic measurements provide
relevant functional property information. Deep kernel active learning
approaches have been utilized to rapidly map local structure to functional
properties in microscopy experiments, but are computationally expensive for
multi-dimensional and correlated output spaces. Here, we present an alternative
lightweight curiosity algorithm which actively samples regions with unexplored
structure-property relations, utilizing a deep-learning based surrogate model
for error prediction. We show that the algorithm outperforms random sampling
for predicting properties from structures, and provides a convenient tool for
efficient mapping of structure-property relationships in materials science.

Method: 开发AI驱动模型，动态调整X射线管阳极和阴极侧的束流权重，模拟临床X射线束的不对称特性。

Result: 实验显示阴极侧剂量率增加9.6%，阳极侧减少12.5%（50-120 kVp），模拟精度显著提升。

Conclusion: AI模型为X射线剂量学提供了更精确的模拟框架，适用于临床和研究中的剂量优化和图像质量提升。

Abstract: This study enhances Monte Carlo simulation accuracy in X-ray imaging by
developing an AI-driven model for the anode heel effect, achieving improved
beam intensity distribution and dosimetric precision. Through dynamic
adjustments to beam weights on the anode and cathode sides of the X-ray tube,
our machine learning model effectively replicates the asymmetry characteristic
of clinical X-ray beams. Experimental results reveal dose rate increases of up
to 9.6% on the cathode side and reductions of up to 12.5% on the anode side,
for energy levels between 50 and 120 kVp. These experimentally optimized beam
weights were integrated into the OpenGATE and GGEMS Monte Carlo toolkits,
significantly advancing dosimetric simulation accuracy and the image quality
which closely resembles the clinical imaging. Validation with fluence and dose
actors demonstrated that the AI-based model closely mirrors clinical beam
behavior, providing substantial improvements in dose consistency and accuracy
over conventional X-ray models. This approach provides a robust framework for
improving X-ray dosimetry, with potential applications in dose optimization,
imaging quality enhancement, and radiation safety in both clinical and research
settings.

Abstract: Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) planning requires advanced
spatial visualization and consideration of coronary artery depth,
calcification, and pericardial adhesions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
dynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG
planning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from
14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved
segmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and
coronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for
cardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of
coronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion
analysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking
Glass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert
scale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients
(including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with
intraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly
for preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based
pericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings
(r=0.786, P<0.001). Conclusion: This study establishes a visualization
framework for CABG planning that produces clinically relevant dynamic holograms
from patient-specific data, with clinical feedback confirming its effectiveness
for preoperative planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分类潜在危险小行星时往往忽略其动态关系，而GNN能够更好地建模小行星间的相似性，提升分类效果。

Method: 使用NASA数据集（958,524条记录），将小行星建模为节点（轨道和物理特征），边表示相似性，并应用合成少数类过采样技术（SMOTE）解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 模型整体准确率达99%，AUC为0.99，对危险小行星的召回率为78%，F1分数为37%。反照率、近日点距离和半长轴是主要预测特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为行星防御任务提供了可解释且可扩展的解决方案，证实了AI在未来自主导航任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary
defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the
dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical
features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA
dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22%
of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy
of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for
hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance,
and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary
defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation
for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an
interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.

TL;DR: PCCL是一个针对GPU超级计算机优化的通信库，显著提升了大规模LLM训练中的集体通信性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通信库（如RCCL和Cray-MPICH）在GPU超级计算机上存在网络和计算资源利用率低、扩展性差的问题。

Method: 开发了PCCL，专门优化了all-gather和reduce-scatter操作，以最大化利用网络和计算资源，并支持数千个GPU的高效扩展。

Result: PCCL在2048个GPU上比RCCL快6-33倍，比Cray-MPICH快28-70倍；在GPT-3训练中，对7B和13B参数模型分别提速60%和40%。

Conclusion: PCCL显著提升了大规模LLM训练的通信效率，解决了现有库的局限性。

Abstract: We evaluate the current state of collective communication on GPU-based
supercomputers for large language model (LLM) training at scale. Existing
libraries such as RCCL and Cray-MPICH exhibit critical limitations on systems
such as Frontier -- Cray-MPICH underutilizes network and compute resources,
while RCCL suffers from severe scalability issues. To address these challenges,
we introduce PCCL, a communication library with highly optimized
implementations of all-gather and reduce-scatter operations tailored for
distributed deep learning workloads. PCCL is designed to maximally utilize all
available network and compute resources and to scale efficiently to thousands
of GPUs. It achieves substantial performance improvements, delivering 6-33x
speedups over RCCL and 28-70x over Cray-MPICH for all-gather on 2048 GCDs of
Frontier. These gains translate directly to end-to-end performance: in
large-scale GPT-3-style training, PCCL provides up to 60% and 40% speedups over
RCCL for 7B and 13B parameter models, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出FlashOverlap，一种轻量级设计，通过瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性优化多GPU计算中的通信瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多GPU计算中，GPU间通信成为瓶颈，尤其在消费级GPU上。现有设计无法同时满足瓦片级重叠、无干扰计算和通信无关性。

Method: 提出FlashOverlap，利用新型信号机制识别瓦片级数据依赖，并重新排序数据以实现高效通信。

Result: 实验显示FlashOverlap最高提速1.65倍，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlashOverlap通过轻量级设计有效解决了多GPU通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved remarkable success across various
applications, driving the demand for multi-GPU computing. Inter-GPU
communication becomes a bottleneck in multi-GPU computing systems, particularly
on consumer-grade GPUs. By exploiting concurrent hardware execution,
overlapping computation and communication latency is an effective technique for
mitigating the communication overhead. We identify that an efficient and
adaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to
maximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to
maintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication
agnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication
primitives. Nevertheless, current designs fail to simultaneously optimize for
all of those features.
  To address the issue, we propose FlashOverlap, a lightweight design
characterized by tile-wise overlapping, interference-free computation, and
communication agnosticism. FlashOverlap utilizes a novel signaling mechanism to
identify tile-wise data dependency without interrupting the computation
process, and reorders data to contiguous addresses, enabling communication by
simply calling NCCL APIs. Experiments show that such a lightweight design
achieves up to 1.65x speedup, outperforming existing works in most cases.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为\proj的信任驱动的跨机构联邦学习框架，通过去中心化编排和分布式存储，解决了信任与资源效率的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在隐私保护方面具有优势，但机构间缺乏有效协作机制，导致信任与资源效率的权衡问题。

Method: 开发了\proj框架，采用去中心化编排和分布式存储，支持同步和异步模式处理滞后节点。

Result: 在多样化测试平台上，\proj表现与理想的多级集中式FL相当，同时实现信任与资源优化。

Conclusion: \proj为跨机构联邦学习提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，平衡了信任与资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in
which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients
and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the
data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware
ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate
independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to
the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in
balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a
third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel
FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable.
Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local
models directly, which requires significant computational resources for
validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and
resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we
develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called \proj, which uses
decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. \proj provides flexibility
to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous
modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that
\proj achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL
while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.

TL;DR: SwiftMoE是一种自适应MoE训练系统，通过解耦专家参数和优化器状态的放置，动态调整资源分配，显著提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE模型训练中，专家负载不平衡导致性能与准确性之间的权衡问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: SwiftMoE静态分区优化器状态，动态调整专家参数放置，避免迁移开销，优化GPU资源分配。

Result: 与DeepSpeed和FlexMoE相比，SwiftMoE分别实现了30.5%和25.9%的更快收敛时间。

Conclusion: SwiftMoE通过创新的资源分配策略，成功解决了MoE训练中的性能-准确性权衡问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a widely adopted solution to
continue scaling model sizes without a corresponding linear increase in
compute. During MoE model training, each input token is dynamically routed to a
subset of experts -- sparsely-activated feed-forward networks -- within each
transformer layer. The distribution of tokens assigned to each expert varies
widely and rapidly over the course of training. To handle the wide load
imbalance across experts, current systems are forced to either drop tokens
assigned to popular experts, degrading convergence, or frequently rebalance
resources allocated to each expert based on popularity, incurring high state
migration overheads.
  To break this performance-accuracy tradeoff, we introduce SwiftMoE, an
adaptive MoE training system. The key insight of SwiftMoE is to decouple the
placement of expert parameters from their large optimizer state. SwiftMoE
statically partitions the optimizer of each expert across all training nodes.
Meanwhile, SwiftMoE dynamically adjusts the placement of expert parameters by
repurposing existing weight updates, avoiding migration overheads. In doing so,
SwiftMoE right-sizes the GPU resources allocated to each expert, on a
per-iteration basis, with minimal overheads. Compared to state-of-the-art MoE
training systems, DeepSpeed and FlexMoE, SwiftMoE is able to achieve a 30.5%
and 25.9% faster time-to-convergence, respectively.

Abstract: Background and Context. The increasing integration of large language models
(LLMs) in computing education presents an emerging challenge in understanding
how students use LLMs and craft prompts to solve computational tasks. Prior
research has used both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze
prompting behavior, but these approaches lack scalability or fail to
effectively capture the semantic evolution of prompts. Objective. In this
paper, we investigate whether students prompts can be systematically analyzed
using propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can
identify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide
insights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce
Prompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into
logical constraints. The constraints are able to represent the intent of the
prompts in succinct and quantifiable ways. We used this approach to analyze a
dataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming
tasks. Findings. We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend
to use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often
modify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies
midway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most
helpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications. This work offers
a new and scalable way to detect students who struggle in solving natural
language programming tasks. This work could be extended to investigate more
complex tasks and integrated into programming tools to provide real-time
support.

Method: 在1,298名参与者中进行对照研究，比较LLMs（GPT-4o、Llama 3、Command R+）与对照组在10个医疗场景中的表现。

Result: LLMs单独测试时表现优异（条件识别94.9%，处置建议56.3%），但在用户交互中准确率大幅下降（条件识别<34.5%，处置建议<44.2%）。

Conclusion: 建议在医疗领域部署LLMs前进行系统性用户测试，以评估其交互能力。

Abstract: Global healthcare providers are exploring use of large language models (LLMs)
to provide medical advice to the public. LLMs now achieve nearly perfect scores
on medical licensing exams, but this does not necessarily translate to accurate
performance in real-world settings. We tested if LLMs can assist members of the
public in identifying underlying conditions and choosing a course of action
(disposition) in ten medical scenarios in a controlled study with 1,298
participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive assistance from an
LLM (GPT-4o, Llama 3, Command R+) or a source of their choice (control). Tested
alone, LLMs complete the scenarios accurately, correctly identifying conditions
in 94.9% of cases and disposition in 56.3% on average. However, participants
using the same LLMs identified relevant conditions in less than 34.5% of cases
and disposition in less than 44.2%, both no better than the control group. We
identify user interactions as a challenge to the deployment of LLMs for medical
advice. Standard benchmarks for medical knowledge and simulated patient
interactions do not predict the failures we find with human participants.
Moving forward, we recommend systematic human user testing to evaluate
interactive capabilities prior to public deployments in healthcare.

Abstract: Collaborative research often includes contributors with varied perspectives
from diverse linguistic backgrounds. However, English as a Second Language

comprehend discussions, leading to limited contribution. To investigate these
challenges, we surveyed 64 ESL researchers who frequently collaborate in
multilingual teams and identified four key design goals around participation,
comprehension, documentation, and feedback. Guided by these design goals, we
developed LINC, a multimodal Language INdependent Collaboration system with two
components: a real-time module for multilingual communication during meetings
and a post-meeting dashboard for discussion analysis. We evaluated the system
through a two-phased study with six triads of multilingual teams. We found that
using LINC, participants benefited from communicating in their preferred
language, recalled and reviewed actionable insights, and prepared for upcoming
meetings effectively. We discuss external factors that impact multilingual
meeting participation beyond language preferences and the implications of
multimodal systems in facilitating meetings in hybrid multilingual
collaborative settings beyond research.

Conclusion: 该框架为动态驾驶环境中的人机协作提供了新思路。

Abstract: The goal of the current study is to introduce a triadic human-AI
collaboration framework for the automated vehicle domain. Previous
classifications (e.g., SAE Levels of Automation) focus on defining automation
levels based on who controls the vehicle. However, it remains unclear how human
users and AI should collaborate in real-time, especially in dynamic driving
contexts, where roles can shift frequently. To fill the gap, this study
proposes a triadic human-AI collaboration framework with three AI roles (i.e.,
Advisor, Co-Pilot, and Guardian) that dynamically adapt to human needs.
Overall, the study lays a foundation for developing adaptive, role-based
human-AI collaboration strategies in automated vehicles.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时、人机交互的手势控制框架，通过分析实时视频输入动态调整音频和音乐，实现舞者和表演者通过动作影响音乐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在创建一种视觉与听觉刺激之间的响应式连接，为现场表演、互动装置和个人使用提供沉浸式体验。

Method: 整合计算机视觉和机器学习技术，追踪和解释动作，用户可操纵音频元素（如节奏、音高、效果和播放顺序）。

Result: 通过持续训练实现用户无关功能，仅需50至80个样本即可标记简单手势，展示人机交互的无缝结合。

Conclusion: 该框架通过手势训练、提示映射和音频操作，实现了动态交互体验，突出了人类互动与机器响应的自然结合。

Abstract: We introduce a real-time, human-in-the-loop gesture control framework that
can dynamically adapt audio and music based on human movement by analyzing live
video input. By creating a responsive connection between visual and auditory
stimuli, this system enables dancers and performers to not only respond to
music but also influence it through their movements. Designed for live
performances, interactive installations, and personal use, it offers an
immersive experience where users can shape the music in real time.
  The framework integrates computer vision and machine learning techniques to
track and interpret motion, allowing users to manipulate audio elements such as
tempo, pitch, effects, and playback sequence. With ongoing training, it
achieves user-independent functionality, requiring as few as 50 to 80 samples
to label simple gestures. This framework combines gesture training, cue
mapping, and audio manipulation to create a dynamic, interactive experience.
Gestures are interpreted as input signals, mapped to sound control commands,
and used to naturally adjust music elements, showcasing the seamless interplay
between human interaction and machine response.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a machine learning analysis of circular dichroism spectra of
globular proteins from the SP175 database, using the optimal transport-based
$1$-Wasserstein distance $\mathcal{W}_1$ (with order $p=1$) and the manifold
learning algorithm $t$-SNE. Our results demonstrate that $\mathcal{W}_1$ is
consistent with both Euclidean and Manhattan metrics while exhibiting
robustness to noise. On the other hand, $t$-SNE uncovers meaningful structure
in the high-dimensional data. The clustering in the $t$-SNE embedding is
primarily determined by proteins with distinct secondary structure
compositions: one cluster predominantly contains $\beta$-rich proteins, while
the other consists mainly of proteins with mixed $\alpha/\beta$ and
$\alpha$-helical content.

*Shubhada Agrawal,Aaditya Ramdas*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 论文证明了复合零假设与备择假设序列检验停止时间的两个下界，分别适用于α趋近于0和KL_inf趋近于0的情况，并给出了匹配上界的充分条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复合假设检验中停止时间的理论下界，扩展了现有结果的适用范围，无需参考测度或紧性假设。

Method: 通过分析KL_inf（一种KL散度的下确界）和α的关系，推导出停止时间的下界，并验证匹配上界的条件。

Result: 得到两个下界：1) α趋近于0时，下界为log(1/α)/KL_inf；2) KL_inf趋近于0时，下界为c KL_inf^{-1} log log KL_inf^{-1}。

Conclusion: 论文在更一般条件下证明了停止时间的下界，并验证了匹配上界的条件，适用于多种特例。

Abstract: We prove two lower bounds for stopping times of sequential tests between
general composite nulls and alternatives. The first lower bound is for the
setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals
$\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed
$\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where
$\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the
null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c
\operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a
universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching
the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases.
Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form;
our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not
requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.

TL;DR: VersBand是一个多任务歌曲生成框架，通过VocalBand和AccompBand等模型实现高质量、可控的歌曲生成，解决了现有方法在提示控制和对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成提示控制的歌曲时，难以实现人声和伴奏的对齐及多样性任务支持。

Method: VersBand包含VocalBand（基于流匹配的人声生成模型）和AccompBand（基于流变换的伴奏生成模型），以及LyricBand和MelodyBand，支持多任务生成。

Result: 实验表明，VersBand在多个任务上优于基线模型，客观和主观指标均有提升。

Conclusion: VersBand通过多任务框架实现了高质量、可控的歌曲生成，解决了对齐和多样性问题。

Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on
various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and
accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally,
they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we
introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing
high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these
primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching
method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing
fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a
flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable
experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for
generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3)
Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies,
contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for
extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate
that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song
generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are
available at https://VersBand.github.io.

TL;DR: CAV2vec是一种自监督学习框架，用于处理音频-视觉联合损坏问题，通过自蒸馏和多任务学习提升AVSR的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注音频损坏，而视觉损坏（如唇部遮挡或模糊视频）同样影响AVSR性能，需解决这一现实挑战。

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法，学生模型通过损坏的输入帧预测教师模型生成的干净目标，并结合单模态多任务学习对齐损坏模态。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种损坏环境下显著提高了AVSR的识别准确性。

Conclusion: CAV2vec通过处理联合损坏问题，提升了音频-视觉融合的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual
modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments
where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has
largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual
corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also
detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel
self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed
to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation
approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to
predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input
frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills
cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean
audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted
audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space
caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust
audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that
the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition
accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Motivation: 传统人工耳蜗编码策略（如ACE）在适应性和精确性上受限，深度学习技术有望提供更优解决方案。

Method: 使用深度学习生成电刺激图，并与ACE策略通过STOI指标比较音频信号重建的清晰度。

Result: 深度学习模型的STOI得分为0.6031，接近ACE的0.6126，且在灵活性和适应性上表现更优。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI技术可提升人工耳蜗的个性化和效率，具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) play a vital role in restoring hearing for
individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss by directly
stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals. While traditional
coding strategies, such as the advanced combination encoder (ACE), have proven
effective, they are constrained by their adaptability and precision. This paper
investigates the use of deep learning (DL) techniques to generate
electrodograms for CIs, presenting our model as an advanced alternative. We
compared the performance of our model with the ACE strategy by evaluating the
intelligibility of reconstructed audio signals using the short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI) metric. The results indicate that our model achieves a
STOI score of 0.6031, closely approximating the 0.6126 score of the ACE
strategy, and offers potential advantages in flexibility and adaptability. This
study underscores the benefits of incorporating artificial intelligent (AI)
into CI technology, such as enhanced personalization and efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨不同参数调优方法对萤火虫算法性能的影响，验证其灵活性和有效性。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛、拟蒙特卡洛和拉丁超立方采样三种方法调优FA参数，并通过统计假设检验（t检验、F检验、Friedman检验和ANOVA）分析结果。

Result: 调优方法对FA性能无显著影响，参数值与调优方法无关，说明FA在解决优化问题时具有灵活性和有效性。

Conclusion: FA的参数调优方法选择灵活，三种方法均能有效调优，算法性能不受调优方法影响。

Abstract: There are many different nature-inspired algorithms in the literature, and
almost all such algorithms have algorithm-dependent parameters that need to be
tuned. The proper setting and parameter tuning should be carried out to
maximize the performance of the algorithm under consideration. This work is the
extension of the recent work on parameter tuning by Joy et al. (2024) presented
at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2024), and the
Firefly Algorithm (FA) is tuned using three different methods: the Monte Carlo
method, the Quasi-Monte Carlo method and the Latin Hypercube Sampling. The FA
with the tuned parameters is then used to solve a set of six different
optimization problems, and the possible effect of parameter setting on the
quality of the optimal solutions is analyzed. Rigorous statistical hypothesis
tests have been carried out, including Student's t-tests, F-tests,
non-parametric Friedman tests and ANOVA. Results show that the performance of
the FA is not influenced by the tuning methods used. In addition, the tuned
parameter values are largely independent of the tuning methods used. This
indicates that the FA can be flexible and equally effective in solving
optimization problems, and any of the three tuning methods can be used to tune
its parameters effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间重标Langevin动力学的自适应步长MCMC采样框架，通过引入额外自由度动态调整步长，提高数值稳定性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定步长MCMC采样在复杂后验分布中可能效率低下或不稳定，需要一种自适应步长方法以优化性能。

Method: 通过引入额外变量和时间重标，结合辅助松弛方程动态调整步长，无需修改物理系统的漂移项。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在Neal's funnel和MNIST数据分类的贝叶斯神经网络中提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架易于实现，可与现有固定步长Langevin积分器结合，显著提升采样效率和稳定性。

Abstract: We present a framework for adaptive-stepsize MCMC sampling based on
time-rescaled Langevin dynamics, in which the stepsize variation is dynamically
driven by an additional degree of freedom. Our approach augments the phase
space by an additional variable which in turn defines a time
reparameterization. The use of an auxiliary relaxation equation allows
accumulation of a moving average of a local monitor function and provides for
precise control of the timestep while circumventing the need to modify the
drift term in the physical system. Our algorithm is straightforward to
implement and can be readily combined with any off-the-peg fixed-stepsize
Langevin integrator. As a particular example, we consider control of the
stepsize by monitoring the norm of the log-posterior gradient, which takes
inspiration from the Adam optimizer, the stepsize being automatically reduced
in regions of steep change of the log posterior and increased on plateaus,
improving numerical stability and convergence speed. As in Adam, the stepsize
variation depends on the recent history of the gradient norm, which enhances
stability and improves accuracy compared to more immediate control approaches.
We demonstrate the potential benefit of this method--both in accuracy and in
stability--in numerical experiments including Neal's funnel and a Bayesian
neural network for classification of MNIST data.

Result: 合成器能够处理更大规模的合成问题，且速度显著快于之前基于CPU的最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPU友好的技术不仅适用于程序合成，还有潜力提升其他形式化方法工作负载的性能。

Abstract: Program synthesis is an umbrella term for generating programs and logical
formulae from specifications. With the remarkable performance improvements that
GPUs enable for deep learning, a natural question arose: can we also implement
a search-based program synthesiser on GPUs to achieve similar performance
improvements? In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based
on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which
takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical
formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With
GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to
minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser
scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster
than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make
our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of
other formal methods (FM) workloads.

Motivation: 传统强化学习算法依赖外部系统，导致环境实现受限，存在同步和通信开销或非结构化编程问题。

Result: Rulebook降低了开发成本，支持创建更复杂的环境，且无性能开销。

Conclusion: Rulebook为强化学习环境开发提供了高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, due to their reliance on external
systems to learn from, require digital environments (e.g., simulators) with
very simple interfaces, which in turn constrain significantly the
implementation of such environments. In particular, these environments are
implemented either as separate processes or as state machines, leading to
synchronization and communication overheads in the first case, and to
unstructured programming in the second.
  We propose a new domain-specific, co-routine-based, compiled language, called
Rulebook, designed to automatically generate the state machine required to
interact with machine learning (ML) algorithms and similar applications, with
no performance overhead. Rulebook allows users to express programs without
needing to be aware of the specific interface required by the ML components. By
decoupling the execution model of the program from the syntactical encoding of
the program, and thus without the need for manual state management, Rulebook
allows to create larger and more sophisticated environments at a lower
development cost.

Motivation: 传统Hankel秩最小化方法依赖凸松弛，计算成本高，需多次SVD。

Result: 新方法显著提高计算效率，降低统计误差，且样本复杂度不随轨迹长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 非凸方法在多项式时间内可达到全局最优，实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of
estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of
observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional
approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex
relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions
(SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to
tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel
matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly
over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm
style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated
heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency.
Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields
lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale
linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization.
Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide
theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time.
Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and
validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.

Result: NINODE控制器在满足条件下可渐近稳定NI对象，且机械系统的稳定性条件可转化为神经网络的约束。

Conclusion: 通过非线性质量-弹簧系统验证了NINODE控制器的实用性、有效性和稳定性保证。

Abstract: We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for
mechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary
differential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural
networks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a
Hamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This
NINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI
plant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force
actuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required
for stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural
networks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and
stability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a
nonlinear mass-spring system.

Result: 相比传统DRL方法，该方法具有更高的泛化能力，且网络结构更紧凑、训练数据更少。实际应用验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂动力系统控制中表现出高鲁棒性，为非线性与不确定性控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject
to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric
variations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making
the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a
critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling
certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical
approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.
This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain
randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic
networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the
latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled
system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an
environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness
of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases
training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control
system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based
controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based
controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a
high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network
architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is
verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain
system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests
demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: eT2QFNN在气动系数建模中表现出优越性，并通过Delta方法验证了其稳定性和控制导数的分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding
and optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents
the novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network
(eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to
express the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear
aircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based
structure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional
batch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and
data noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic
rule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the
aerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different
studies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data
and the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling
performance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts.
Furthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared
to Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the
proposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are
analyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in
representing aerodynamic coefficients.

Method: ODDIT由两个机器学习模型组成，分别预测未来船舶状态和判断该状态是否为OOD。

Result: 在模拟条件下（包括传感器和执行器噪声以及环境干扰），ODDIT在多个船舶上实现了高精度的OOD状态检测（AUROC和TNR@TPR95达到99%）。

Conclusion: ODDIT为自主船舶提供了一种有效的实时异常检测和干预方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with
software enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables
an AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination.
Digital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running
what-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault
diagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using
continuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly
possible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced
analyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine
learning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based
approach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV
before reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate
anomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and
assist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two
machine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the
predicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across
waypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor
and actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT
achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores
reaching 99\% across multiple vessels.

*Vijay Prakash S*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过奇异扰动直线方程生成的S形曲线，提出其可作为统计模型，从均匀分布到单值零熵的过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨S形曲线在统计建模中的潜力，尤其是如何从均匀分布过渡到单值分布。

Method: 通过奇异扰动直线方程生成S形曲线，并将其叠加用于拟合鸢尾花数据集。

Result: S形曲线能有效捕捉非均匀模式，但参数估计对初始条件敏感。

Conclusion: S形曲线可作为统计模型，但需注意参数估计的局限性。

Abstract: Straight line equation $y=mx$ with slope $m$, when singularly perturbed as
$ay^3+y=mx$ with a positive parameter $a$, results in S-shaped curves or
S-curves on a real plane. As $a\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a
cumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that
describes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable.
As $a\rightarrow\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$
resembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work,
we propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform
distribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves
are superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally
linear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of
natural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of
enzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form
as a statistical model. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing
flower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern
recognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can
be represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our
parametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to
initial conditions depending on the data at hand.

Result: 此类AI系统能增强用户判断力，保持自主性，而非削弱。

Conclusion: 论文提出自主性保护AI系统的关键特征，为增强而非削弱人类判断力的AI设计指明方向。

Abstract: In the face of rapidly advancing AI technology, individuals will increasingly
rely on AI agents to navigate life's growing complexities, raising critical
concerns about maintaining both human agency and autonomy. This paper addresses
a fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either
becoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having
autonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent
of ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of
choice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes,
initially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to
erode autonomy. To counteract this risk, the paper proposes a philosophic turn
in AI design. AI should be constructed to facilitate decentralized
truth-seeking and open-ended inquiry, mirroring the Socratic method of
philosophical dialogue. By promoting individual and collective adaptive
learning, such AI systems would empower users to maintain control over their
judgments, augmenting their agency without undermining autonomy. The paper
concludes by outlining essential features for autonomy-preserving AI systems,
sketching a path toward AI systems that enhance human judgment rather than
undermine it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算教育因复杂性和现有工具限制面临挑战，需要更智能、适应性强的教学辅助系统。

Method: 系统结合知识图谱和双LLM代理（教学代理和课程规划代理），通过中央知识图谱协调任务，并引入标签系统减少LLM幻觉。

Result: 初步结果显示系统能捕获丰富交互数据，动态调整课程计划，并通过知识图谱实现情境感知辅导。

Conclusion: 系统展示了潜力，但需进一步系统性评估。

Abstract: Quantum computing education faces significant challenges due to its
complexity and the limitations of current tools; this paper introduces a novel
Intelligent Teaching Assistant for quantum computing education and details its
evolutionary design process. The system combines a knowledge-graph-augmented
architecture with two specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents: a Teaching
Agent for dynamic interaction, and a Lesson Planning Agent for lesson plan
generation. The system is designed to adapt to individual student needs, with
interactions meticulously tracked and stored in a knowledge graph. This graph
represents student actions, learning resources, and relationships, aiming to
enable reasoning about effective learning pathways. We describe the
implementation of the system, highlighting the challenges encountered and the
solutions implemented, including introducing a dual-agent architecture where
tasks are separated, all coordinated through a central knowledge graph that
maintains system awareness, and a user-facing tag system intended to mitigate
LLM hallucination and improve user control. Preliminary results illustrate the
system's potential to capture rich interaction data, dynamically adapt lesson
plans based on student feedback via a tag system in simulation, and facilitate
context-aware tutoring through the integrated knowledge graph, though
systematic evaluation is required.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在现代电影中的双重影响，解决人机关系、创造力与自动化的平衡，以及伦理问题。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合理论框架（作者理论、人机关系）和案例研究（《The Safe Zone》《Fast & Furious 7》《The Brutalist》）。

Result: 将AI定位为‘体现工具’而非‘独立伙伴’可保护人类创作权和艺术完整性。发现AI驱动市场的监控资本主义风险和深度伪造技术的伦理困境。

Conclusion: 提出国际监管框架和人类控制指数（HCI）以量化AI参与，为电影制作、政策制定和学术研究提供指导，保护文化多样性和伦理标准。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence(AI) into film production has
revolutionized efficiency and creativity, yet it simultaneously raises critical
ethical and practical challenges. This study explores the dual impact of AI on
modern cinema through three objectives: defining the optimal human-AI
relationship, balancing creativity with automation, and developing ethical
guidelines. By employing a mixed-method approach combining theoretical
frameworks (auteur theory, human-technology relations) and case studies (The
Safe Zone, Fast & Furious 7, The Brutalist), the research reveals that
positioning AI as an "embodiment tool" rather than an independent "alterity
partner" preserves human authorship and artistic integrity. Key findings
highlight the risks of surveillance capitalism in AI-driven markets and the
ethical dilemmas of deepfake technology. The study concludes with actionable
recommendations, including international regulatory frameworks and a Human
Control Index (HCI) to quantify AI involvement. These insights aim to guide
filmmakers, policymakers, and scholars in navigating the evolving AI-cinema
landscape while safeguarding cultural diversity and ethical standards.

Motivation: 探讨如何在不同地区的AI监管框架中平衡人权保护与技术发展。

Method: 比较分析美国、欧洲、中国和新加坡的AI监管策略及其对人权的关注。

Result: 欧洲注重严格保护个人权利，美国倾向宽松以促进创新，中国强调国家控制，新加坡倡导自我监管。

Conclusion: 需全球对话以协调AI监管，兼顾人权保护与技术发展，反映地区多样性。

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of human rights considerations into AI
regulatory frameworks across different IEEE regions - specifically the United
States (Region 1-6), Europe (Region 8), China (part of Region 10), and
Singapore (part of Region 10). While all acknowledge the transformative
potential of AI and the necessity of ethical guidelines, their regulatory
approaches significantly differ. Europe exhibits a rigorous framework with
stringent protections for individual rights, while the U.S. promotes innovation
with less restrictive regulations. China emphasizes state control and societal
order in its AI strategies. In contrast, Singapore's advisory framework
encourages self-regulation and aligns closely with international norms. This
comparative analysis underlines the need for ongoing global dialogue to
harmonize AI regulations that safeguard human rights while promoting
technological advancement, reflecting the diverse perspectives and priorities
of each region.

Result: 学生需提升AI素养、批判性思维和伦理意识；教师需关注课程设计和GenAI整合。

Conclusion: 教育机构应确保公平使用GenAI，制定学术诚信政策，并推动全球研究。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools such as ChatGPT are emerging
as a revolutionary tool in education that brings both positive aspects and
challenges for educators and students, reshaping how learning and teaching are
approached. This study aims to identify and evaluate the key competencies
students need to effectively engage with GenAI in education and to provide
strategies for lecturers to integrate GenAI into teaching practices. The study
applied a mixed method approach with a combination of a literature review and a
quantitative survey involving 130 students from South Asia and Europe to obtain
its findings. The literature review identified 14 essential student skills for
GenAI engagement, with AI literacy, critical thinking, and ethical AI practices
emerging as the most critical. The student survey revealed gaps in prompt
engineering, bias awareness, and AI output management. In our study of lecturer
strategies, we identified six key areas, with GenAI Integration and Curriculum
Design being the most emphasised. Our findings highlight the importance of
incorporating GenAI into education. While literature prioritized ethics and
policy development, students favour hands-on, project-based learning and
practical AI applications. To foster inclusive and responsible GenAI adoption,
institutions should ensure equitable access to GenAI tools, establish clear
academic integrity policies, and advocate for global GenAI research
initiatives.

Motivation: 社会认知超载在AI时代对人类福祉和社会韧性构成严峻挑战，需解决以应对AI的潜在风险。

Method: 通过分析AI加剧认知超载的机制（如信息泛滥、算法操纵等），重新构建AI安全讨论框架。

Result: 认知超载是连接短期危害与长期风险的桥梁，需从制度、研究和政策角度探索解决方案。

Conclusion: 论文提出了基于认知超载视角的未来研究方向和政策建议，而非提供具体解决方案。

Abstract: Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and
complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and
societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is
not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial
prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including
existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through
various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic
manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.
The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,
highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.
It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research
directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an
overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for
future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.

Result: 在摘要任务中性能提升26%，并成功应用于Dell的生产环境。

Conclusion: MODP为提示工程提供了更全面和高效的优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to their popularity
across multiple use-cases. However, prompt engineering, the process for
optimally utilizing such models, remains approximation-driven and subjective.
Most of the current research on prompt engineering focuses on task-specific
optimization, while neglecting the behavior of the LLM under consideration
during prompt development. This paper introduces MODP -- Multi Objective
Directional Prompting, a framework based on two key concepts: 1)
multi-objectivity: the importance of considering an LLM's intrinsic behavior as
an additional objective in prompt development, and 2) directional prompting: a
metrics-driven method for prompt engineering to ensure development of robust
and high-precision prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
ideas on a summarization task, using a synthetically created dataset, achieving
a 26% performance gain over initial prompts. Finally, we apply MODP to develop
prompts for Dell's Next Best Action support tool, which is now in production
and is used by more than 10,000 internal support agents and serving millions of
customers worldwide.

Abstract: We study the complexity of satisfiability problems in probabilistic and
causal reasoning. Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\ldots$ over finite domains,
the basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events
$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic
terms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication
(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a
joint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of
(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and
linear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean
satisfiability, while Moss\'e et al. (2022) proved that for polynomial terms,
it is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
  Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) extends the probabilistic setting with
interventional and counterfactual reasoning, enriching the expressiveness of
languages. However, Moss\'e et al. (2022) found that satisfiability complexity
remains unchanged. Van der Zander et al. (2023) showed that introducing a
marginalization operator to languages induces a significant increase in
complexity.
  We extend this line of work by adding two new dimensions to the problem by
constraining the models. First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying
structural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and
give a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.
Second, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable
instances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with
compact marginalization. We characterize the complexities of satisfiability
under small-model constraints across different settings.

Motivation: 纳什均衡在一般和博弈中难以计算，而现有的后悔最小化方法只能收敛到粗相关均衡（CCE）。

Method: 通过元学习减少后悔最小化算法产生的策略相关性，从而更接近纳什均衡。

Result: 在一般和不完全信息博弈中，该方法显著优于现有后悔最小化技术。

Conclusion: 元学习方法能有效逼近纳什均衡，同时保持收敛到CCE的保证。

Abstract: Nash equilibrium is perhaps the best-known solution concept in game theory.
Such a solution assigns a strategy to each player which offers no incentive to
unilaterally deviate. While a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to always exist,
the problem of finding one in general-sum games is PPAD-complete, generally
considered intractable. Regret minimization is an efficient framework for
approximating Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. However, in
general-sum games, such algorithms are only guaranteed to converge to a
coarse-correlated equilibrium (CCE), a solution concept where players can
correlate their strategies. In this work, we use meta-learning to minimize the
correlations in strategies produced by a regret minimizer. This encourages the
regret minimizer to find strategies that are closer to a Nash equilibrium. The
meta-learned regret minimizer is still guaranteed to converge to a CCE, but we
give a bound on the distance to Nash equilibrium in terms of our meta-loss. We
evaluate our approach in general-sum imperfect information games. Our
algorithms provide significantly better approximations of Nash equilibria than
state-of-the-art regret minimization techniques.

Conclusion: 全局信息整合的元学习方法在自对弈场景中表现优越，为大规模均衡近似提供了新思路。

Abstract: Regret minimization is a general approach to online optimization which plays
a crucial role in many algorithms for approximating Nash equilibria in
two-player zero-sum games. The literature mainly focuses on solving individual
games in isolation. However, in practice, players often encounter a
distribution of similar but distinct games. For example, when trading
correlated assets on the stock market, or when refining the strategy in
subgames of a much larger game. Recently, offline meta-learning was used to
accelerate one-sided equilibrium finding on such distributions. We build upon
this, extending the framework to the more challenging self-play setting, which
is the basis for most state-of-the-art equilibrium approximation algorithms for
domains at scale. When selecting the strategy, our method uniquely integrates
information across all decision states, promoting global communication as
opposed to the traditional local regret decomposition. Empirical evaluation on
normal-form games and river poker subgames shows our meta-learned algorithms
considerably outperform other state-of-the-art regret minimization algorithms.

Result: 实验证明SI-CLAD能有效控制假阳性率并提升真阳性率。

Conclusion: SI-CLAD在理论和实验上均表现出色，为异常检测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental problem in machine
learning and statistics. A popular approach to unsupervised AD is
clustering-based detection. However, this method lacks the ability to guarantee
the reliability of the detected anomalies. In this paper, we propose SI-CLAD
(Statistical Inference for CLustering-based Anomaly Detection), a novel
statistical framework for testing the clustering-based AD results. The key
strength of SI-CLAD lies in its ability to rigorously control the probability
of falsely identifying anomalies, maintaining it below a pre-specified
significance level $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha = 0.05$). By analyzing the selection
mechanism inherent in clustering-based AD and leveraging the Selective
Inference (SI) framework, we prove that false detection control is attainable.
Moreover, we introduce a strategy to boost the true detection rate, enhancing
the overall performance of SI-CLAD. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets provide strong empirical support for our theoretical
findings, showcasing the superior performance of the proposed method.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints
is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications.
However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement
learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety,
exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations
for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem
of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics.
We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must
with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe
algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the
regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a
natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for
safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new
baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal
controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever
the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our
controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained
setting.

Motivation: 传统的最小二乘估计器在非高斯噪声下表现不佳，残差常呈现非正态分布特性，因此需要其他范数（如$L_p$-范数）来优化估计。

Method: 提出局部多项式$L_p$-范数回归，用加权$L_p$-范数估计替代加权最小二乘估计，并引入新方法从残差中估计参数$p$。

Result: 数值和理论研究表明，该方法在一维数据中优于局部最小二乘法，并在二维数据中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: $L_p$-范数回归方法在非高斯噪声环境下具有更好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: The local least squares estimator for a regression curve cannot provide
optimal results when non-Gaussian noise is present. Both theoretical and
empirical evidence suggests that residuals often exhibit distributional
properties different from those of a normal distribution, making it worthwhile
to consider estimation based on other norms. It is suggested that $L_p$-norm
estimators be used to minimize the residuals when these exhibit non-normal
kurtosis. In this paper, we propose a local polynomial $L_p$-norm regression
that replaces weighted least squares estimation with weighted $L_p$-norm
estimation for fitting the polynomial locally. We also introduce a new method
for estimating the parameter $p$ from the residuals, enhancing the adaptability
of the approach. Through numerical and theoretical investigation, we
demonstrate our method's superiority over local least squares in
one-dimensional data and show promising outcomes for higher dimensions,
specifically in 2D.

Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability
distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in
other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical
inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require,
or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel
mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting
the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have
access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by
providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along
with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also
provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the
embeddings.

Conclusion: 参数化IPM在高维任务中表现优越，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a parametric integral probability metric (IPM) to measure the
discrepancy between two probability measures. The proposed IPM leverages a
specific parametric family of discriminators, such as single-node neural
networks with ReLU activation, to effectively distinguish between
distributions, making it applicable in high-dimensional settings. By optimizing
over the parameters of the chosen discriminator class, the proposed IPM
demonstrates that its estimators have good convergence rates and can serve as a
surrogate for other IPMs that use smooth nonparametric discriminator classes.
We present an efficient algorithm for practical computation, offering a simple
implementation and requiring fewer hyperparameters. Furthermore, we explore its
applications in various tasks, such as covariate balancing for causal inference
and fair representation learning. Across such diverse applications, we
demonstrate that the proposed IPM provides strong theoretical guarantees, and
empirical experiments show that it achieves comparable or even superior
performance to other methods.

time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This
paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware
spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal
correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of
high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active
learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for
data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy
achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the
G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance
across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the
spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments
show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism
of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.

*Alexander Dubbs*

TL;DR: 论文推导了岭回归在大数据极限下的理想训练/测试分割，发现分割对岭参数α的依赖较弱，主要取决于训练样本数m和特征数n。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是最大化模型的“完整性”，使训练模型的测量误差尽可能接近理论值。

Method: 通过数学计算在大数据极限下推导岭回归的理想分割。

Result: 岭回归的分割结果与前人对普通线性回归的分割结果在前两项渐近项上一致，实际差异很小。

Conclusion: 这是首次在大数据极限下为机器学习模型数学计算理想分割，岭回归的分割结果与普通线性回归几乎无差异。

Abstract: We derive the ideal train/test split for the ridge regression to high
accuracy in the limit that the number of training rows m becomes large. The
split must depend on the ridge tuning parameter, alpha, but we find that the
dependence is weak and can asymptotically be ignored; all parameters vanish
except for m and the number of features, n. This is the first time that such a
split is calculated mathematically for a machine learning model in the large
data limit. The goal of the calculations is to maximize "integrity," so that
the measured error in the trained model is as close as possible to what it
theoretically should be. This paper's result for the ridge regression split
matches prior art for the plain vanilla linear regression split to the first
two terms asymptotically, and it appears that practically there is no
difference.

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了RLHF中的关键问题，为模型优化和人类偏好对齐提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a pivotal
paradigm in artificial intelligence to align large models with human
preferences. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to
simultaneously conduct the online decision-making and statistical inference on
the optimal model using human preference data based on dynamic contextual
information. Our approach introduces an efficient decision strategy that
achieves both the optimal regret bound and the asymptotic distribution of the
estimators. A key challenge in RLHF is handling the dependent online human
preference outcomes with dynamic contexts. To address this, in the
methodological aspect, we propose a two-stage algorithm starting with
$\epsilon$-greedy followed by exploitations; in the theoretical aspect, we
tailor anti-concentration inequalities and matrix martingale concentration
techniques to derive the uniform estimation rate and asymptotic normality of
the estimators using dependent samples from both stages. Extensive simulation
results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art strategies. We
apply the proposed framework to analyze the human preference data for ranking
large language models on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding dataset,
yielding insightful results on the performance of different large language
models for medical anatomy knowledge.

Result: 量化了模型大小（训练样本数与模型维度比）对双下降行为的影响。

Conclusion: 揭示了双下降现象的数学理论，为模型复杂度与测试误差关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent studies observed a surprising concept on model test error called the
double descent phenomenon, where the increasing model complexity decreases the
test error first and then the error increases and decreases again. To observe
this, we work on a two layer neural network model with a ReLU activation
function designed for binary classification under supervised learning. Our aim
is to observe and investigate the mathematical theory behind the double descent
behavior of model test error for varying model sizes. We quantify the model
size by the ratio of number of training samples to the dimension of the model.
Due to the complexity of the empirical risk minimization procedure, we use the
Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem to find a suitable candidate for the global
training loss.

Conclusion: 该框架为连续和二元预测模型提供了一种统一的不确定性量化方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: When implementing prediction models for high-stakes real-world applications
such as medicine, finance, and autonomous systems, quantifying prediction
uncertainty is critical for effective risk management. Traditional approaches
to uncertainty quantification, such as confidence and prediction intervals,
provide probability coverage guarantees for the expected outcomes
$f(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the realized outcomes $f(\boldsymbol{x})+\epsilon$.
Instead, this paper introduces a novel, model-agnostic framework for
quantifying uncertainty in continuous and binary outcomes using confidence sets
for outcome excursions, where the goal is to identify a subset of the feature
space where the expected or realized outcome exceeds a specific value. The
proposed method constructs data-dependent inner and outer confidence sets that
aim to contain the true feature subset for which the expected or realized
outcomes of these features exceed a specified threshold. We establish
theoretical guarantees for the probability that these confidence sets contain
the true feature subset, both asymptotically and for finite sample sizes. The
framework is validated through simulations and applied to real-world datasets,
demonstrating its utility in contexts such as housing price prediction and time
to sepsis diagnosis in healthcare. This approach provides a unified method for
uncertainty quantification that is broadly applicable across various continuous
and binary prediction models.

Motivation: 现有协同过滤算法通常仅利用用户或物品结构之一，导致次优性能。本文旨在通过同时利用两者结构提升推荐效果。

Method: 采用潜在变量模型对用户和物品进行聚类，设计了一种同时利用用户和物品结构的算法，并通过信息论下界证明其最优性。

Result: 提出的算法在理论分析中表现出接近最优的性能，优于仅利用单一结构的传统方法。

Conclusion: 同时利用用户和物品结构能显著提升推荐系统的性能，单一结构方法存在次优性。

Abstract: We consider an online model for recommendation systems, with each user being
recommended an item at each time-step and providing 'like' or 'dislike'
feedback. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users
and items are clustered into types. The model captures structure in both the
item and user spaces, as used by item-item and user-user collaborative
filtering algorithms. We study the situation in which the type preference
matrix has i.i.d. entries. Our main contribution is an algorithm that
simultaneously uses both item and user structures, proved to be near-optimal
via corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds. In particular, our
analysis highlights the sub-optimality of using only one of item or user
structure (as is done in most collaborative filtering algorithms).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对Telegram生态系统的广泛理解空白，特别是在意大利文化背景下，研究其政治话语、意识形态和毒性传播。

Method: 利用网络分析、大型语言模型和毒性检测工具，分析2023年收集的13,151个聊天中的1.86亿条消息。

Result: 发现主题和意识形态的同质性、混合意识形态社区、毒性在高度毒性社区中被广泛接受，以及仇恨言论主要针对黑人、犹太人和同性恋者。

Conclusion: 研究首次大规模绘制了意大利Telegram生态系统，为跨文化和语言背景的在线毒性研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative
media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and
toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena
or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader
understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill
this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere,
leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in
2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection
tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically,
and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results
show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed
ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on
particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that
toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely
normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian
discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals
independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national
hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and
intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical
divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian
Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity,
and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity
across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.

TL;DR: REED-VAE提出了一种新的训练方案，解决了潜在扩散模型在多次迭代编辑时累积噪声和伪影的问题，支持多种编辑方法的组合使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前潜在扩散模型在多次迭代编辑同一图像时，由于像素和潜在空间的反复转换，会累积伪影和噪声，限制了其灵活性和实用性。

Method: 通过REED训练方案优化变分自编码器（VAE），使其在多次迭代编辑后仍能保持图像质量。

Result: REED-VAE在多种图像编辑场景中表现优异，包括基于文本和掩码的编辑框架，提升了编辑的成功率和精确性。

Conclusion: REED-VAE为多方法图像编辑任务提供了新的基准，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their
application to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When
trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they
accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and
latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by
performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing
flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion
editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for
variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even
after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:
users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation
building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based
operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of
REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and
mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the
overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and
precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for
the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing. Our code and models
will be available at https://github.com/galmog/REED-VAE

Result: 实验表明TransparentGS在复杂环境中快速准确地恢复透明物体。

Conclusion: TransparentGS为计算机图形学和视觉中的透明物体处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods has led to
considerable advancements in novel view synthesis and 3D object reconstruction.
Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant
challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields
to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering
transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent
secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast
inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main
contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of
transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable
specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we
leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light
and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative
probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in
our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of
our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as
well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将顶点、边和面分离处理，缺乏对几何和拓扑的统一建模，限制了复杂形状和不规则拓扑的生成能力。

Method: CLR-Wire使用注意力驱动的VAE将曲线及其拓扑编码为连续潜在空间，并通过流匹配模型从高斯噪声生成完整3D线框。

Conclusion: CLR-Wire提供了一种高效、全面的解决方案，能够联合学习几何和拓扑，为复杂形状生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce CLR-Wire, a novel framework for 3D curve-based wireframe
generation that integrates geometry and topology into a unified Continuous
Latent Representation. Unlike conventional methods that decouple vertices,
edges, and faces, CLR-Wire encodes curves as Neural Parametric Curves along
with their topological connectivity into a continuous and fixed-length latent
space using an attention-driven variational autoencoder (VAE). This unified
approach facilitates joint learning and generation of both geometry and
topology. To generate wireframes, we employ a flow matching model to
progressively map Gaussian noise to these latents, which are subsequently
decoded into complete 3D wireframes. Our method provides fine-grained modeling
of complex shapes and irregular topologies, and supports both unconditional
generation and generation conditioned on point cloud or image inputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art
generative approaches, our method achieves substantial improvements in
accuracy, novelty, and diversity, offering an efficient and comprehensive
solution for CAD design, geometric reconstruction, and 3D content creation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sketch2Anim的方法，通过条件运动合成将2D故事板草图自动转换为3D动画，解决了传统方法耗时且依赖专家的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D动画制作依赖人工试错，耗时且需要专业知识，因此需要自动化方法将2D草图直接转换为3D动画。

Method: Sketch2Anim包含两个模块：草图约束理解和运动生成。通过3D关键姿势、关节轨迹和动作词实现精确控制，并设计神经映射器对齐2D草图与3D运动。

Result: 方法成功将故事板转换为高质量3D动画，支持直接3D动画编辑，实验和用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Sketch2Anim为2D到3D动画转换提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Storyboarding is widely used for creating 3D animations. Animators use the 2D
sketches in storyboards as references to craft the desired 3D animations
through a trial-and-error process. The traditional approach requires
exceptional expertise and is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.
Consequently, there is a high demand for automated methods that can directly
translate 2D storyboard sketches into 3D animations. This task is
under-explored to date and inspired by the significant advancements of motion
diffusion models, we propose to address it from the perspective of conditional
motion synthesis. We thus present Sketch2Anim, composed of two key modules for
sketch constraint understanding and motion generation. Specifically, due to the
large domain gap between the 2D sketch and 3D motion, instead of directly
conditioning on 2D inputs, we design a 3D conditional motion generator that
simultaneously leverages 3D keyposes, joint trajectories, and action words, to
achieve precise and fine-grained motion control. Then, we invent a neural
mapper dedicated to aligning user-provided 2D sketches with their corresponding
3D keyposes and trajectories in a shared embedding space, enabling, for the
first time, direct 2D control of motion generation. Our approach successfully
transfers storyboards into high-quality 3D motions and inherently supports
direct 3D animation editing, thanks to the flexibility of our multi-conditional
motion generator. Comprehensive experiments and evaluations, and a user
perceptual study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D或3D分割方法在皮肤与非皮肤区域分割上表现不佳，导致人脸注册质量下降。

Method: 结合冻结的图像基础模型提取多视角图像特征，并与3D扫描网格的几何特征融合，直接在扫描网格上预测分割掩码。

Result: 相比纯2D或3D分割方法，注册精度分别提高了8.89%和14.3%，且模型在真实数据上泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态特征融合有效解决了皮肤分割问题，提升了人脸注册质量。

Abstract: Face registration deforms a template mesh to closely fit a 3D face scan, the
quality of which commonly degrades in non-skin regions (e.g., hair, beard,
accessories), because the optimized template-to-scan distance pulls the
template mesh towards the noisy scan surface. Improving registration quality
requires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh.
Existing image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however
perform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks,
and they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while
scan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images. In
this work, we introduce a novel method that accurately separates skin from
non-skin geometry on 3D human head scans. For this, our method extracts
features from multi-view images using a frozen image foundation model and
aggregates these features in 3D. These lifted 2D features are then fused with
3D geometric features extracted from the scan mesh, to then predict a
segmentation mask directly on the scan mesh. We show that our segmentations
improve the registration accuracy over pure 2D or 3D segmentation methods by
8.89% and 14.3%, respectively. Although trained only on synthetic data, our
model generalizes well to real data.

Abstract: This study investigated visual impairment complaints in a sample of 948
Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) patients using the DiaNAH dataset, emphasizing
advanced machine learning techniques for managing missing data. Patients
completed a CVS questionnaire capturing eight types of visual symptoms,
including blurred vision and altered contrast perception. Due to incomplete
data, 181 patients were excluded, resulting in an analytical subset of 767
individuals. To address the challenge of missing data, an automated machine
learning (AutoML) approach was employed for data imputation, preserving the
distributional characteristics of the original dataset. Patients were grouped
according to singular and combined complaint clusters derived from the 40,320
potential combinations identified through the CVS questionnaire. A linear
correlation analysis revealed minimal to no direct relationship between
patient-reported visual complaints and standard visual perceptual function
tests. This study represents an initial systematic attempt to understand the
complex relationship between subjective visual complaints and objective visual
perceptual assessments in ABI patients. Given the limitations of sample size
and variability, further studies with larger populations are recommended to
robustly explore these complaint clusters and their implications for visual
perception following brain injury.

Result: 发现宏观经济、金融、政策和地缘政治不确定性对跨机制波动动态具有强预测力。

Conclusion: 研究为系统性不确定性如何影响金融市场实际演变和隐含波动率提供了统一实证视角。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structural dynamics of stock market volatility
through the Financial Chaos Index, a tensor- and eigenvalue-based measure
designed to capture realized volatility via mutual fluctuations among asset
prices. Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior
and perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a
regime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law
distribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023
identifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and
high-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress,
statistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the
segmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that
shape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors
derived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net
regression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index.
Our findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and
geopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility
dynamics across regimes. Together, these results offer a unified empirical
perspective on how systemic uncertainty governs both the realized evolution of
financial markets and the anticipatory behavior embedded in implied volatility
measures.

Abstract: As the US tax law evolves to adapt to ever-changing politico-economic
realities, tax preparation software plays a significant role in helping
taxpayers navigate these complexities. The dynamic nature of tax regulations
poses a significant challenge to accurately and timely maintaining tax software
artifacts. The state-of-the-art in maintaining tax prep software is
time-consuming and error-prone as it involves manual code analysis combined
with an expert interpretation of tax law amendments. We posit that the rigor
and formality of tax amendment language, as expressed in IRS publications,
makes it amenable to automatic translation to executable specifications (code).
Our research efforts focus on identifying, understanding, and tackling
technical challenges in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
ChatGPT and Llama, to faithfully extract code differentials from IRS
publications and automatically integrate them with the prior version of the
code to automate tax prep software maintenance.

Motivation: 人工注释易过时，影响模型性能，而LLM生成的注释质量更高，可能改进预训练数据。

Method: 提出两种无参考评估任务（代码-注释不一致性检测和语义代码搜索），并用LLM生成的注释重建数据集。

Result: LLM生成的注释与代码语义一致性更高，基于其重建的数据集训练的模型在多项任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM可有效替代人工注释，提升预训练数据质量，推动代码智能发展。

Abstract: Pre-trained code models rely heavily on high-quality pre-training data,
particularly human-written reference comments that bridge code and natural
language. However, these comments often become outdated as software evolves,
degrading model performance. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating
high-quality code comments. We investigate whether replacing human-written
comments with LLM-generated ones improves pre-training datasets. Since standard
metrics cannot assess reference comment quality, we propose two novel
reference-free evaluation tasks: code-comment inconsistency detection and
semantic code search. Results show that LLM-generated comments are more
semantically consistent with code than human-written ones, as confirmed by
manual evaluation. Leveraging this finding, we rebuild the CodeSearchNet

demonstrate that models trained on LLM-enhanced data outperform those using

*Jagrit Acharya,Gouri Ginde*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过指令微调的大型语言模型（LLMs）将非结构化的缺陷报告自动转换为高质量的结构化报告，评估了Qwen 2.5、Mistral和Llama 3.2等模型的表现，发现Qwen 2.5在CTQRS指标上表现最佳，达到77%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺陷报告中的信息不清晰或不完整会导致修复效率低下，论文旨在通过自动化方法减少开发者的手动工作量。

Method: 使用指令微调的LLMs（Qwen 2.5、Mistral、Llama 3.2和ChatGPT-4o）对缺陷报告进行结构化转换，并通过CTQRS、ROUGE等指标评估性能。

Result: Qwen 2.5在CTQRS上表现最优（77%），Llama 3.2在检测缺失字段（如预期行为和实际行为）上更准确，Qwen 2.5在重现步骤上F1得分为76%。模型在其他项目（如Eclipse、GCC）上也表现良好（CTQRS达70%）。

Conclusion: 指令微调的LLMs能有效自动化生成结构化缺陷报告，减少开发者手动工作，提升软件维护效率。

Abstract: Bug reports contain the information developers need to triage and fix
software bugs. However, unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous information may lead
to delays and excessive manual effort spent on bug triage and resolution. In
this paper, we explore whether Instruction fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) can automatically transform casual, unstructured bug reports into
high-quality, structured bug reports adhering to a standard template. We
evaluate three open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (\emph{Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and
Llama 3.2}) against ChatGPT-4o, measuring performance on established metrics
such as CTQRS, ROUGE, METEOR, and SBERT. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
Qwen 2.5 achieves a CTQRS score of \textbf{77%}, outperforming both fine-tuned
Mistral (\textbf{71%}), Llama 3.2 (\textbf{63%}) and ChatGPT in 3-shot learning
(\textbf{75%}). Further analysis reveals that Llama 3.2 shows higher accuracy
of detecting missing fields particularly Expected Behavior and Actual Behavior,
while Qwen 2.5 demonstrates superior performance in capturing
Steps-to-Reproduce, with an F1 score of 76%. Additional testing of the models
on other popular projects (e.g., Eclipse, GCC) demonstrates that our approach
generalizes well, achieving up to \textbf{70%} CTQRS in unseen projects' bug
reports. These findings highlight the potential of instruction fine-tuning in
automating structured bug report generation, reducing manual effort for
developers and streamlining the software maintenance process.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出EP-Shield框架，用于评估和净化标识符替换攻击，通过自然性感知推理提升对抗样本的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码语言模型在软件工程任务中的广泛应用暴露了对对抗攻击的脆弱性，尤其是标识符替换攻击。现有攻击生成的对抗样本常有不自然的代码模式。

Method: 提出EP-Shield框架，先评估代码自然性并识别对抗代码，再净化以恢复模型正确预测。

Result: 实验显示EP-Shield优于对抗微调（提升达83.36%），且设计轻量（7B参数）性能媲美GPT-4。

Conclusion: EP-Shield能有效检测和净化对抗样本，提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of code language models in software engineering tasks
has exposed vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, especially the identifier
substitution attacks. Although existing identifier substitution attackers
demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with
unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of
adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80%
of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution
attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we
propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier
substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first
evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code,
then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial
fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B
parameters) with GPT-4-level performance.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MMT4NL的框架，受软件测试启发，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的上下文学习（ICL）可信度，通过对抗扰动和软件测试技术揭示其潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在上下文学习中表现出强大能力，但对对抗扰动和语言变化敏感，行为不可预测，因此需要一种系统化的评估方法。

Method: 引入MMT4NL框架，利用对抗扰动和软件测试技术，通过生成变形对抗样本来量化ICL中的缺陷。

Result: 实验表明，MMT4NL能有效揭示先进LLMs中的语言缺陷，特别是在情感分析和问答任务中。

Conclusion: MMT4NL为评估LLMs的ICL能力提供了一种新方法，有助于提升其可信度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large
language models (LLMs), enabling them to perform new tasks based on a few
provided examples without explicit fine-tuning. Despite their impressive
adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial
perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic
variations. Inspired by software testing principles, we introduce a software
testing-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness
of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and software
testing techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic
capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around
the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order
to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is
to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing
the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment
analysis and question-answering tasks. Our experiments could reveal various
linguistic bugs in state-of-the-art LLMs.

*Vahid Garousi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过多源文献综述量化了ChatGPT在不同领域和软件开发生命周期（SDLC）阶段的错误率，发现错误率因领域、任务和模型版本而异，升级模型可提升可靠性，但完全依赖仍需谨慎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ChatGPT等大型语言模型在多个领域广泛应用，但其可靠性问题仍存争议，尤其是在不同领域和SDLC阶段的表现差异。

Method: 采用多源文献综述（MLR）方法，收集截至2025年的学术研究、报告和灰色文献数据，按领域和SE阶段分组并通过箱线图可视化错误分布。

Result: 错误率因领域和模型版本而异：医疗领域8%-83%，商业和经济领域GPT-4错误率降至15-20%，工程任务20-30%，编程成功率达87.5%，但复杂调试错误率超50%。SE中需求与设计阶段错误率较低（5-20%），而编码、测试和维护阶段较高（10-50%）。

Conclusion: 尽管模型升级提升了可靠性，ChatGPT的错误率仍不可忽视，尤其在关键领域需谨慎依赖，持续评估和验证至关重要。

Abstract: Context: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) are widely used
across healthcare, business, economics, engineering, and software engineering
(SE). Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability,
especially their error rates across domains and the software development
lifecycle (SDLC).
  Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error
rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides
an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how
reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).
  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data
from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.
Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were
grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error
distributions.
  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates
ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50%
with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%.
Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over
50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates
(~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability
(10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability.
  Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error
rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human
oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation
and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness.

TL;DR: VeriDebug是一种结合对比表示和引导校正的自动化Verilog调试方法，显著提升了调试准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多种编程语言调试中表现优异，但Verilog调试中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: VeriDebug采用嵌入技术检索内部信息并修复错误，通过共享参数空间统一检测与校正。

Result: VeriDebug在错误修复准确率上达到64.7%，远超现有开源方法（11.3%）和GPT-3.5-turbo（36.6%）。

Conclusion: VeriDebug为Verilog调试提供了更高效的解决方案，优于传统方法和现有模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
debugging for various programming languages. However, the application of LLMs
to Verilog debugging remains insufficiently explored. Here, we present
VeriDebug, an approach that integrates contrastive representation and guided
correction capabilities for automated Verilog debugging. Unlike existing
methods, VeriDebug employs an embedding-based technique to accurately retrieve
internal information, followed by bug-fixing. VeriDebug unifies Verilog bug
detection and correction through a shared parameter space. By simultaneously
learning bug patterns and fixes, it streamlines debugging via contrastive
embedding and guided correction. Empirical results show the efficacy of
VeriDebug in enhancing Verilog debugging. Our VeriDebugLoc, Type model achieves
64.7 accuracy in bug fixing (Acc1), a significant improvement from the existing
open-source SOTAs 11.3. This performance not only outperforms open-source
alternatives but also exceeds larger closed-source models like GPT-3.5-turbo
(36.6), offering a more accurate alternative to conventional debugging methods.

Motivation: 传统QDA方法耗时且依赖人工，LLMs有望提升效率和质量。

Method: 评估LLMs在归纳（零样本）和演绎（一样本、多样本）标注任务中的表现，重点关注GPT-4。

Result: GPT-4在演绎任务中与人类分析师一致性高（Cohen's Kappa>0.7），零样本表现有限；上下文丰富的提示显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是GPT-4）可有效支持QDA，减少人工负担并保持标注质量，同时为需求追溯和领域建模提供结构化标签。

Abstract: Requirements Engineering (RE) is essential for developing complex and
regulated software projects. Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder
inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)
provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional
QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this
paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4,
Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs'
performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot)
annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with
human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7,
while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts
significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in
deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated
runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by
reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured
labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly
utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design.

Result: 单纯LLMs表现有限，但结合强化学习的7B参数模型超越人类专家。

Conclusion: RL训练的LLMs可作为复杂工程优化的有效工具，拓展其应用领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software engineering, but their
application to physical engineering domains remains underexplored. This paper
evaluates LLMs' capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through
RocketBench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high-fidelity rocket simulations.
We test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude
optimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they
struggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and
ultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with
reinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both
SoTA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that
RL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering
optimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software
development.

Method: 提出扩散学习算法，分别针对零和博弈和非零和博弈的两类网络游戏。

Result: 在合理假设下分析了算法的稳定性，并通过实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 扩散学习算法能有效处理团队间的竞争与协作，适用于零和与非零和博弈场景。

Abstract: This paper studies a stochastic dynamic game between two competing teams,
each consisting of a network of collaborating agents. Unlike fully cooperative
settings, where all agents share a common objective, each team in this game
aims to minimize its own distinct objective. In the adversarial setting, their
objectives could be conflicting as in zero-sum games. Throughout the
competition, agents share strategic information within their own team while
simultaneously inferring and adapting to the strategies of the opposing team.
We propose diffusion learning algorithms to address two important classes of
this network game: i) a zero-sum game characterized by weak cross-team subgraph
interactions, and ii) a general non-zero-sum game exhibiting strong cross-team
subgraph interactions. We analyze the stability performance of the proposed
algorithms under reasonable assumptions and illustrate the theoretical results
through experiments on Cournot team competition and decentralized GAN training.

Conclusion: 提出的框架不仅适用于BBC Rewind档案，还可推广到其他大规模档案的说话人检索任务。

Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned
audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient
access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This
paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of
speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two
primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata
for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic
conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse
noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive
(spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker
retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the
content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and
general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like
speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is
unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker
diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges,
possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we
conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various
distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems,
establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a
wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.

Conclusion: \alinet模型为EHT观测提供了一种高效且可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole
accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to
EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is
computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine
learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has
previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their
associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable
set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty
introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including
interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to
calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from
RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics models.

Abstract: Modern Machine Learning (ML) applications often benefit from structured
sparsity, a technique that efficiently reduces model complexity and simplifies
handling of sparse data in hardware. Sparse systolic tensor arrays -
specifically designed to accelerate these structured-sparse ML models - play a
pivotal role in enabling efficient computations. As ML is increasingly
integrated into safety-critical systems, it is of paramount importance to
ensure the reliability of these systems. This paper introduces an online
error-checking technique capable of detecting and locating permanent faults
within sparse systolic tensor arrays before computation begins. The new
technique relies on merely four test vectors and exploits the weight values
already loaded within the systolic array to comprehensively test the system.
Fault-injection campaigns within the gate-level netlist, while executing three
well-established Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), validate the efficiency
of the proposed approach, which is shown to achieve very high fault coverage,
while incurring minimal performance and area overheads.

challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory
intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms
exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them
incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need
for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads.
In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed
to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems.
NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data
dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a
reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and
mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves
31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like
systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates
enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads
scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to
enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a
promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.

*Gang Mao,Tousif Rahman,Sidharth Maheshwari,Bob Pattison,Zhuang Shao,Rishad Shafik,Alex Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态Tsetlin机器（DTM）训练加速器，作为深度神经网络（DNN）的替代方案，用于边缘计算中的高效训练。DTM在FPGA上实现，具有动态重配置能力，适用于多变量传感器任务，性能优于DNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习应用对数据隐私和安全需求的增加，边缘计算中的高效训练变得至关重要。DNN在边缘设备上的部署和训练面临复杂性和资源限制的挑战，需要替代方案。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于逻辑的DTM加速器设计，利用有限状态自动机驱动的学习，支持运行时重配置，无需重新合成。DTM通过Tsetlin自动机与输入数据对齐形成逻辑命题，实现高效LUT映射和低功耗FPGA训练。

Result: 与DNN相比，DTM减少了乘加运算和导数计算，功耗降低6倍，性能提升2.54倍（GOP/s per W）。

Conclusion: DTM是一种高效、低功耗的边缘训练替代方案，适用于多变量传感器任务，具有动态适应性和资源效率。

Abstract: The increased demand for data privacy and security in machine learning (ML)
applications has put impetus on effective edge training on Internet-of-Things
(IoT) nodes. Edge training aims to leverage speed, energy efficiency and
adaptability within the resource constraints of the nodes. Deploying and
training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based models at the edge, although
accurate, posit significant challenges from the back-propagation algorithm's
complexity, bit precision trade-offs, and heterogeneity of DNN layers. This
paper presents a Dynamic Tsetlin Machine (DTM) training accelerator as an
alternative to DNN implementations. DTM utilizes logic-based on-chip inference
with finite-state automata-driven learning within the same Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) package. Underpinned on the Vanilla and Coalesced Tsetlin
Machine algorithms, the dynamic aspect of the accelerator design allows for a
run-time reconfiguration targeting different datasets, model architectures, and
model sizes without resynthesis. This makes the DTM suitable for targeting
multivariate sensor-based edge tasks. Compared to DNNs, DTM trains with fewer
multiply-accumulates, devoid of derivative computation. It is a data-centric ML
algorithm that learns by aligning Tsetlin automata with input data to form
logical propositions enabling efficient Look-up-Table (LUT) mapping and frugal
Block RAM usage in FPGA training implementations. The proposed accelerator
offers 2.54x more Giga operations per second per Watt (GOP/s per W) and uses 6x
less power than the next-best comparable design.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种反事实去偏框架CDMEA，用于解决多模态实体对齐中视觉模态可能带来的偏差问题，通过因果分析提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度依赖视觉模态，可能导致模型偏向图像匹配任务，而忽略了视觉模态不一定总是有益的。

Method: 提出CDMEA框架，从因果角度分析视觉模态偏差，通过估计总效应（TE）并排除视觉模态的自然直接效应（NDE），确保模型基于总间接效应（TIE）进行预测。

Result: 在9个基准数据集上，CDMEA优于14种现有方法，尤其在低相似度、高噪声和低资源数据场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: CDMEA通过反事实去偏有效减少了视觉模态的偏差，提升了多模态实体对齐的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from
different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information
retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and
consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while
overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively.
Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate
unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on
visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality,
leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a
counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates
visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage
both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct
causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the
Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect
(NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the
Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing
visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that
CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity,
high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.

Motivation: 合成图像来源识别因生成技术多样且高质量数据集稀缺而具有挑战性。

Method: 构建WILD数据集，包含封闭集和开放集生成器图像，部分图像经过后处理。

Result: 数据集支持多种任务评估，并测试了七种基线方法在封闭和开放集识别中的表现。

Conclusion: WILD为合成图像来源识别提供了实用工具，并展示了基线方法的性能。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing
number of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer
number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of
high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make
training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very
challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to
provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image
attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular
commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution
models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world
in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a
total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set.
Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD
allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including
closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution
with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD
are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the
dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on
closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with
respect to post-processing.

TL;DR: BQSched是一种基于强化学习的批处理查询调度器，通过注意力机制和优化策略显著提升调度效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具依赖简单启发式规则，难以处理复杂查询特征和相互影响，而强化学习方法虽具潜力但面临调度空间大、采样成本高等问题。

Method: BQSched设计了基于注意力的状态表示和IQ-PPO算法，结合自适应掩码、查询聚类和增量模拟器优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，BQSched在TPC-DS基准测试中平均缩短34%和13%的总完成时间，优于启发式规则和现有RL调度器。

Conclusion: BQSched首次实现非侵入式RL批处理查询调度，显著提升效率、稳定性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Most large enterprises build predefined data pipelines and execute them
periodically to process operational data using SQL queries for various tasks. A
key issue in minimizing the overall makespan of these pipelines is the
efficient scheduling of concurrent queries within the pipelines. Existing tools
mainly rely on simple heuristic rules due to the difficulty of expressing the
complex features and mutual influences of queries. The latest reinforcement
learning (RL) based methods have the potential to capture these patterns from
feedback, but it is non-trivial to apply them directly due to the large
scheduling space, high sampling cost, and poor sample utilization.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose BQSched, a non-intrusive Scheduler
for Batch concurrent Queries via reinforcement learning. Specifically, BQSched
designs an attention-based state representation to capture the complex query
patterns, and proposes IQ-PPO, an auxiliary task-enhanced proximal policy
optimization (PPO) algorithm, to fully exploit the rich signals of Individual
Query completion in logs. Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further
introduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune
the action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large
query sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our
knowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL.
Extensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the
efficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving
remarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries. For example,
across all DBMSs and scales tested, BQSched reduces the overall makespan of
batch queries on TPC-DS benchmark by an average of 34% and 13%, compared with
the commonly used heuristic strategy and the adapted RL-based scheduler,
respectively.

Motivation: 多向量搜索在多模态和多特征场景中日益重要，但索引选择对性能影响显著，而现有研究尚未解决多向量搜索的索引调优问题。

Method: 定义多向量搜索索引调优问题，开发算法以根据工作负载选择最优索引，最小化延迟并满足存储和召回要求。

Result: 与基线相比，提出的方法实现了2.1倍至8.3倍的延迟加速。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多向量搜索中的索引调优挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Vector search plays a crucial role in many real-world applications. In
addition to single-vector search, multi-vector search becomes important for
multi-modal and multi-feature scenarios today. In a multi-vector database, each
row is an item, each column represents a feature of items, and each cell is a
high-dimensional vector. In multi-vector databases, the choice of indexes can
have a significant impact on performance. Although index tuning for relational
databases has been extensively studied, index tuning for multi-vector search
remains unclear and challenging. In this paper, we define multi-vector search
index tuning and propose a framework to solve it. Specifically, given a
multi-vector search workload, we develop algorithms to find indexes that
minimize latency and meet storage and recall constraints. Compared to the
baseline, our latency achieves 2.1X to 8.3X speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人动作分割模型难以复用特征，而计算机视觉方法在对象可见性有限时表现不佳。

Method: 提出M2R2多模态特征提取器，结合本体和外感觉传感器，并设计新的预训练策略。

Result: 在REASSEMBLE数据集上表现最优，比现有模型提升46.6%。

Conclusion: M2R2在多模态动作分割任务中表现优异，且特征可复用。

Abstract: Temporal action segmentation (TAS) has long been a key area of research in
both robotics and computer vision. In robotics, algorithms have primarily
focused on leveraging proprioceptive information to determine skill boundaries,
with recent approaches in surgical robotics incorporating vision. In contrast,
computer vision typically relies on exteroceptive sensors, such as cameras.
Existing multimodal TAS models in robotics integrate feature fusion within the
model, making it difficult to reuse learned features across different models.
Meanwhile, pretrained vision-only feature extractors commonly used in computer
vision struggle in scenarios with limited object visibility. In this work, we
address these challenges by proposing M2R2, a multimodal feature extractor
tailored for TAS, which combines information from both proprioceptive and
exteroceptive sensors. We introduce a novel pretraining strategy that enables
the reuse of learned features across multiple TAS models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the REASSEMBLE dataset, a challenging
multimodal robotic assembly dataset, outperforming existing robotic action
segmentation models by 46.6%. Additionally, we conduct an extensive ablation
study to evaluate the contribution of different modalities in robotic TAS
tasks.

Abstract: This work focuses on the design of a deep learning-based autonomous driving
system deployed and tested on the real-world MIT Racecar to assess its
effectiveness in driving scenarios. The Deep Neural Network (DNN) translates
raw image inputs into real-time steering commands in an end-to-end learning
fashion, following the imitation learning framework. The key design challenge
is to ensure that DNN predictions are accurate and fast enough, at a high
sampling frequency, and result in smooth vehicle operation under different
operating conditions. In this study, we design and compare various DNNs, to
identify the most effective approach for real-time autonomous driving. In
designing the DNNs, we adopted an incremental design approach that involved
enhancing the model capacity and dataset to address the challenges of
real-world driving scenarios. We designed a PD system, CNN, CNN-LSTM, and
CNN-NODE, and evaluated their performance on the real-world MIT Racecar. While
the PD system handled basic lane following, it struggled with sharp turns and
lighting variations. The CNN improved steering but lacked temporal awareness,
which the CNN-LSTM addressed as it resulted in smooth driving performance. The
CNN-NODE performed similarly to the CNN-LSTM in handling driving dynamics, yet
with slightly better driving performance. The findings of this research
highlight the importance of iterative design processes in developing robust
DNNs for autonomous driving applications. The experimental video is available

Method: 采用深度强化学习，结合数据预处理框架校准真实传感器数据，训练算法以同时处理前车和后车行为。

Result: 在模拟高风险场景中，算法有效防止了连环碰撞，且在典型高速公路场景中成功率达到99%，远超现有标准。

Conclusion: 该算法显著提升了高速密集交通中的安全性，为ADAS和ADS系统提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Advanced Driving Systems (ADS)
are key to improving road safety, yet most existing implementations focus
primarily on the vehicle ahead, neglecting the behavior of following vehicles.
This shortfall often leads to chain reaction collisions in high speed, densely
spaced traffic particularly when a middle vehicle suddenly brakes and trailing
vehicles cannot respond in time. To address this critical gap, we propose a
novel longitudinal control and collision avoidance algorithm that integrates
adaptive cruising with emergency braking. Leveraging deep reinforcement
learning, our method simultaneously accounts for both leading and following
vehicles. Through a data preprocessing framework that calibrates real-world
sensor data, we enhance the robustness and reliability of the training process,
ensuring the learned policy can handle diverse driving conditions. In simulated
high risk scenarios (e.g., emergency braking in dense traffic), the algorithm
effectively prevents potential pile up collisions, even in situations involving
heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, in typical highway scenarios where three
vehicles decelerate, the proposed DRL approach achieves a 99% success rate far
surpassing the standard Federal Highway Administration speed concepts guide,
which reaches only 36.77% success under the same conditions.

Abstract: Ensuring safety and robustness of robot skills is becoming crucial as robots
are required to perform increasingly complex and dynamic tasks. The former is
essential when performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is
relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses the challenge
of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic robot skills learned from
demonstrations. Specifically, we build on neural contractive dynamical systems
to provide robust extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a
full-body obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability via
diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in complex environments
where implicit scene representations, such as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs),
are necessary. To this end, our framework called Signed Distance Field
Diffeomorphic Transform, leverages SDFs and flow-based diffeomorphisms to
achieve contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evaluate our
framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world robotic tasks in a
kitchen environment. Our results show that our approach locally adapts the
learned contractive vector field while staying close to the learned dynamics
and without introducing highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 多模态接触传感的集成能加速开发有效的接触感知操控策略，推动家用机器人的可靠性和多功能性。

Abstract: Achieving robust dexterous manipulation in unstructured domestic environments
remains a significant challenge in robotics. Even with state-of-the-art robot
learning methods, haptic-oblivious control strategies (i.e. those relying only
on external vision and/or proprioception) often fall short due to occlusions,
visual complexities, and the need for precise contact interaction control. To
address these limitations, we introduce PolyTouch, a novel robot finger that
integrates camera-based tactile sensing, acoustic sensing, and peripheral
visual sensing into a single design that is compact and durable. PolyTouch
provides high-resolution tactile feedback across multiple temporal scales,
which is essential for efficiently learning complex manipulation tasks.
Experiments demonstrate an at least 20-fold increase in lifespan over
commercial tactile sensors, with a design that is both easy to manufacture and
scalable. We then use this multi-modal tactile feedback along with
visuo-proprioceptive observations to synthesize a tactile-diffusion policy from
human demonstrations; the resulting contact-aware control policy significantly
outperforms haptic-oblivious policies in multiple contact-aware manipulation
policies. This paper highlights how effectively integrating multi-modal contact
sensing can hasten the development of effective contact-aware manipulation
policies, paving the way for more reliable and versatile domestic robots. More

Conclusion: GSFF-SLAM在稀疏噪声信号下表现出色，为语义3D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic-aware 3D scene reconstruction is essential for autonomous robots to
perform complex interactions. Semantic SLAM, an online approach, integrates
pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and semantic mapping into a unified
framework, shows significant potential. However, existing systems, which rely
on 2D ground truth priors for supervision, are often limited by the sparsity
and noise of these signals in real-world environments. To address this
challenge, we propose GSFF-SLAM, a novel dense semantic SLAM system based on 3D
Gaussian Splatting that leverages feature fields to achieve joint rendering of
appearance, geometry, and N-dimensional semantic features. By independently
optimizing feature gradients, our method supports semantic reconstruction using
various forms of 2D priors, particularly sparse and noisy signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in both
tracking accuracy and photorealistic rendering quality. When utilizing 2D
ground truth priors, GSFF-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
performance with 95.03\% mIoU, while achieving up to 2.9$\times$ speedup with
only marginal performance degradation.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有基线，为机器人抓握研究提供了高质量数据和工具。

Abstract: Generalizable dexterous grasping with suitable grasp types is a fundamental
skill for intelligent robots. Developing such skills requires a large-scale and
high-quality dataset that covers numerous grasp types (i.e., at least those
categorized by the GRASP taxonomy), but collecting such data is extremely
challenging. Existing automatic grasp synthesis methods are often limited to
specific grasp types or object categories, hindering scalability. This work
proposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich,
penetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object,
and articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each
hand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem
with two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then
locally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the
synthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows
the hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object.
Those validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate
future synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
previous type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our
algorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps,
covering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy. Finally, we train a
type-conditional generative model that successfully performs the desired grasp
type from single-view object point clouds, achieving an 82.3% success rate in
real-world experiments. Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/Dexonomy.

Abstract: Perception systems in robotics encounter significant challenges in high-speed
and dynamic conditions when relying on traditional cameras, where motion blur
can compromise spatial feature integrity and task performance. Brain-inspired
vision sensors (BVS) have recently gained attention as an alternative, offering
high temporal resolution with reduced bandwidth and power requirements. Here,
we present the first quantitative evaluation framework for two representative
classes of BVSs in variable-speed robotic sensing, including event-based vision
sensors (EVS) that detect asynchronous temporal contrasts, and the
primitive-based sensor Tianmouc that employs a complementary mechanism to
encode both spatiotemporal changes and intensity. A unified testing protocol is
established, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing
platforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an
imaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as
motion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For
functional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and
motion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS
performs well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex
scenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings
due to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In
comparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and
complex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise,
high-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable
insights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and
support further advancement in this area.

Result: NORA在任务性能上优于现有大型VLA模型，同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: NORA为实时机器人自主性提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promising performance
in zero-shot scenarios, demonstrating impressive task execution and reasoning
capabilities. However, a significant challenge arises from the limitations of
visual encoding, which can result in failures during tasks such as object
grasping. Moreover, these models typically suffer from high computational
overhead due to their large sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. While these
models excel in reasoning and task planning, the substantial computational
overhead they incur makes them impractical for real-time robotic environments,
where speed and efficiency are paramount. To address the limitations of
existing VLA models, we propose NORA, a 3B-parameter model designed to reduce
computational overhead while maintaining strong task performance. NORA adopts
the Qwen-2.5-VL-3B multimodal model as its backbone, leveraging its superior
visual-semantic understanding to enhance visual reasoning and action grounding.
Additionally, our \model{} is trained on 970k real-world robot demonstrations
and equipped with the FAST+ tokenizer for efficient action sequence generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that NORA outperforms existing large-scale VLA
models, achieving better task performance with significantly reduced
computational overhead, making it a more practical solution for real-time
robotic autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态机器人运动导致2D地图（如占用网格地图）质量下降，影响下游任务（如平面图创建）。

Method: 结合3D SLAM的精确位姿估计技术，将其应用于2D形式，并利用GAN减少噪声和误差。

Result: 实验显示地图保真度和质量显著提升，噪声和误差减少，适用于大规模复杂环境。

Conclusion: GAN-SLAM为SLAM领域带来重要进展，提升地图任务实用性，并为GAN在占用网格误差校正中的应用提供新思路。

Abstract: SLAM is a fundamental component of modern autonomous systems, providing
robots and their operators with a deeper understanding of their environment.
SLAM systems often encounter challenges due to the dynamic nature of robotic
motion, leading to inaccuracies in mapping quality, particularly in 2D
representations such as Occupancy Grid Maps. These errors can significantly
degrade map quality, hindering the effectiveness of specific downstream tasks
such as floor plan creation. To address this challenge, we introduce our novel
'GAN-SLAM', a new SLAM approach that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks
to clean and complete occupancy grids during the SLAM process, reducing the
impact of noise and inaccuracies introduced on the output map. We adapt and
integrate accurate pose estimation techniques typically used for 3D SLAM into a
2D form. This enables the quality improvement 3D LiDAR-odometry has seen in
recent years to be effective for 2D representations. Our results demonstrate
substantial improvements in map fidelity and quality, with minimal noise and
errors, affirming the effectiveness of GAN-SLAM for real-world mapping
applications within large-scale complex environments. We validate our approach
on real-world data operating in real-time, and on famous examples of 2D maps.
The improved quality of the output map enables new downstream tasks, such as
floor plan drafting, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous systems.
Our novel approach to SLAM offers a significant step forward in the field,
improving the usability for SLAM in mapping-based tasks, and offers insight
into the usage of GANs for OGM error correction.

Motivation: 2D SLAM在复杂环境中存在定位漂移和地图噪声问题，限制了其在特定任务（如平面图创建）中的有效性。

Method: 采用TT-OGM方法，结合3D SLAM的位姿估计技术和GANs进行误差校正，并通过DRL生成训练数据。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在复杂环境中能生成高质量地图，优于现有SLAM算法。

Conclusion: TT-OGM显著提升了2D SLAM的地图质量和可靠性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) is a crucial component for
robotic systems, providing a map of an environment, the current location and
previous trajectory of a robot. While 3D LiDAR SLAM has received notable
improvements in recent years, 2D SLAM lags behind. Gradual drifts in odometry
and pose estimation inaccuracies hinder modern 2D LiDAR-odometry algorithms in
large complex environments. Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent
estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map
quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and
unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps
according to uncertain observations. This is why OGMs are so popular in
exploration or navigation tasks. However, this also limits OGMs' effectiveness
for specific mapping based tasks such as floor plan creation in complex scenes.
To address this, we propose our novel Transformation and Translation Occupancy
Grid Mapping (TT-OGM). We adapt and enable accurate and robust pose estimation
techniques from 3D SLAM to the world of 2D and mitigate errors to improve map
quality using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We introduce a novel data
generation method via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to build datasets large
enough for training a GAN for SLAM error correction. We demonstrate our SLAM in
real-time on data collected at Loughborough University. We also prove its
generalisability on a variety of large complex environments on a collection of
large scale well-known 2D occupancy maps. Our novel approach enables the
creation of high quality OGMs in complex scenes, far surpassing the
capabilities of current SLAM algorithms in terms of quality, accuracy and
reliability.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for enabling real-time imitation of
human head motion by a Nao robot, with a primary focus on elevating human-robot
interactions. By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer
vision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this
research endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including
blink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these
indicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework
which facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions,
utilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback
from the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high
degree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2
score of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds
promise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a
valuable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work
explores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion
recognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for
individuals with unique communication needs.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）与人类驾驶车辆（HVs）共存时，安全可靠的决策仍面临挑战，尤其是车道变换和交互中意图估计的模糊性。

Method: 结合DAG的社会意图估计算法和DRL决策框架，在模拟环境中测试车道变换场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提升了AVs在车道变换中的安全性和效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为AVs在复杂交通环境中的可靠决策提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Since the emergence of autonomous driving technology, it has advanced rapidly
over the past decade. It is becoming increasingly likely that autonomous
vehicles (AVs) would soon coexist with human-driven vehicles (HVs) on the
roads. Currently, safety and reliable decision-making remain significant
challenges, particularly when AVs are navigating lane changes and interacting
with surrounding HVs. Therefore, precise estimation of the intentions of
surrounding HVs can assist AVs in making more reliable and safe lane change
decision-making. This involves not only understanding their current behaviors
but also predicting their future motions without any direct communication.
However, distinguishing between the passing and yielding intentions of
surrounding HVs still remains ambiguous. To address the challenge, we propose a
social intention estimation algorithm rooted in Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
coupled with a decision-making framework employing Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) algorithms. To evaluate the method's performance, the proposed framework
can be tested and applied in a lane-changing scenario within a simulated
environment. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate how our approach
enhances the ability of AVs to navigate lane changes safely and efficiently on
roads.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文分析了梯度下降优化方法及其变体（如Adam和RMSprop）的收敛速度，发现Adam与动量法具有相同的快速收敛率，而RMSprop则与标准梯度下降相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同优化方法（如Adam和RMSprop）在训练深度神经网络时的收敛速度，以验证其性能优劣。

Method: 通过理论分析比较标准梯度下降、动量法、Adam和RMSprop在局部极小值附近的收敛速率。

Result: Adam与动量法具有相同的快速收敛率（√x -1)/(√x +1)，而RMSprop的收敛率与标准梯度下降相同（x -1)/(x +1)。

Conclusion: Adam在收敛速度上优于RMSprop，与动量法相当，验证了其作为高效优化器的优势。

Abstract: Gradient descent based optimization methods are the methods of choice to
train deep neural networks in machine learning. Beyond the standard gradient
descent method, also suitable modified variants of standard gradient descent
involving acceleration techniques such as the momentum method and/or adaptivity
techniques such as the RMSprop method are frequently considered optimization
methods. These days the most popular of such sophisticated optimization schemes
is presumably the Adam optimizer that has been proposed in 2014 by Kingma and
Ba. A highly relevant topic of research is to investigate the speed of
convergence of such optimization methods. In particular, in 1964 Polyak showed
that the standard gradient descent method converges in a neighborhood of a
strict local minimizer with rate (x - 1)(x + 1)^{-1} while momentum achieves
the (optimal) strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} - 1)(\sqrt{x} +
1)^{-1} where x \in (1,\infty) is the condition number (the ratio of the
largest and the smallest eigenvalue) of the Hessian of the objective function
at the local minimizer. It is the key contribution of this work to reveal that
Adam also converges with the strictly faster convergence rate (\sqrt{x} -
1)(\sqrt{x} + 1)^{-1} while RMSprop only converges with the convergence rate (x
- 1)(x + 1)^{-1}.

Method: 提出SUPERB标注框架，结合LLM生成产品标注，并评估现有检索和排名方法。

Result: 实证评估了多种方法，为新数据集提供了见解，并探讨了其在实际电商系统中的应用。

Conclusion: LLMs能有效处理隐含最高级查询，SUPERB框架为改进推荐系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: In Recommender Systems, users often seek the best products through indirect,
vague, or under-specified queries, such as "best shoes for trail running". Such
queries, also referred to as implicit superlative queries, pose a significant
challenge for standard retrieval and ranking systems as they lack an explicit
mention of attributes and require identifying and reasoning over complex
factors. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate implicit
attributes for ranking as well as reason over them to improve product
recommendations for such queries. As a first step, we propose a novel
four-point schema for annotating the best product candidates for superlative
queries called SUPERB, paired with LLM-based product annotations. We then
empirically evaluate several existing retrieval and ranking approaches on our
new dataset, providing insights and discussing their integration into
real-world e-commerce production systems.

Motivation: 解决如何在大型语言模型（LLMs）输入限制下有效管理大量外部知识的问题，并比较延迟分块和上下文检索两种方法的优劣。

Method: 通过严格分析延迟分块和上下文检索，评估它们在优化RAG系统中的效果和效率。

Result: 上下文检索能更有效地保持语义连贯性，但计算资源需求更高；延迟分块效率更高，但相关性和完整性较差。

Conclusion: 研究为RAG系统的技术选择提供了权衡依据，需根据具体需求平衡连贯性和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a transformative approach for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external
knowledge sources. Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of
external knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs?
Traditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller,
fixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often
fragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence
in generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late
chunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to
preserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths
and limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late
chunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and
efficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual
retrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater
computational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency
but tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的偏差校正方法，用于修正气候模型在孟加拉湾的海表温度（SST）预测，相比传统方法减少了15%的均方根误差（RMSE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候模型（如CMIP）在孟加拉湾的预测存在显著偏差，例如CNRM-CM6模型的SST预测与再分析数据（ORAS5）相比有1.5°C的RMSE。

Method: 开发了三种深度学习模型（UNet、双向LSTM和ConvLSTM）用于偏差校正，并与线性回归和EDCDF方法对比。

Result: UNet模型表现最佳，使用气候学去除后的数据训练，RMSE比EDCDF方法降低了15%。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法显著提升了气候模型预测的准确性，为未来气候研究提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Climate change affects ocean temperature, salinity and sea level, impacting
monsoons and ocean productivity. Future projections by Global Climate Models
based on shared socioeconomic pathways from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP) are widely used to understand the effects of climate change.
However, CMIP models have significant bias compared to reanalysis in the Bay of
Bengal for the time period when both projections and reanalysis are available.
For example, there is a 1.5C root mean square error (RMSE) in the sea surface
temperature (SST) projections of the climate model CNRM-CM6 compared to the
Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5). We develop a suite of data-driven deep
learning models for bias correction of climate model projections and apply it
to correct SST projections of the Bay of Bengal. We propose the use of three
different deep neural network architectures: convolutional encoder-decoder
UNet, Bidirectional LSTM and ConvLSTM. We also use a baseline linear regression
model and the Equi-Distant Cumulative Density Function (EDCDF) bias correction
method for comparison and evaluating the impact of the new deep learning
models. All bias correction models are trained using pairs of monthly CMIP6
projections and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as input and output. Historical
data (1950-2014) and future projection data (2015-2020) of CNRM-CM6 are used
for training and validation, including hyperparameter tuning. Testing is
performed on future projection data from 2021 to 2024. Detailed analysis of the
three deep neural models has been completed. We found that the UNet
architecture trained using a climatology-removed CNRM-CM6 projection as input
and climatology-removed ORAS5 as output gives the best bias-corrected
projections. Our novel deep learning-based method for correcting CNRM-CM6 data
has a 15% reduction in RMSE compared EDCDF.

Motivation: 6G网络对虚拟化网络功能（VNF）的管理提出了更高要求，传统优化方法可扩展性差，数据驱动方法难以平衡计算效率与SFC依赖关系。

Method: 采用Transformer-empowered actor-critic框架，结合自注意力机制和ε-LoPe探索策略，实现序列感知的SFC分区。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为6G网络提供了可扩展的SFC分区方案，还连接了大语言模型与下一代网络优化的前沿进展。

Abstract: In the forthcoming era of 6G networks, characterized by unprecedented data
rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive connectivity, effective management of
Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) is essential. VNFs are software-based
counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and
scalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as
ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network
services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network
infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency
constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based
methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven
approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the
capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic
framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By
utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex
inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized
decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and
convergence using $\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic
Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms
of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and
scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances
intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution
for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of
next-generation networks.

Motivation: 填补现有研究在非线性手术流程和时空上下文对分类能力影响的空白。

Method: 通过定制平台让不同经验水平的泌尿科医生对RAPN的单帧和视频片段进行分类，并训练带有时空上下文的AI模型。

Result: 视频片段和视觉标志物提高了分类准确性，专家表现优于新手，AI模型与专家表现相当，时空上下文进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: SPR对专家和AI均具挑战性，时空信息能提升表现，未来自动化SPR可能依赖手术工具和器官作为关键标志物。

Abstract: Purpose: Automated Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) uses Artificial
Intelligence (AI) to segment the surgical workflow into its key events,
functioning as a building block for efficient video review, surgical education
as well as skill assessment. Previous research has focused on short and linear
surgical procedures and has not explored if temporal context influences
experts' ability to better classify surgical phases. This research addresses
these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly
non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and
tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video
snippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their
confidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI
architectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on
the Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results:
Video snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase
classification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence
in their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating
phases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the
survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases.
Conclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer
vision, where both perform equally well when given the same context.
Performance increases when temporal information is provided. Surgical tools and
organs form the key landmarks for human interpretation and are expected to
shape the future of automated SPR.

Conclusion: Res-SAM为地下异常检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，提升城市安全监测效率。

Abstract: Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing
threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing
electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains
challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and
indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data
fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves
critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the
Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework
exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data.
Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal
prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing
information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and
complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world
experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%)
and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal
accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple
human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable,
resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across
diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual
effort and computational cost.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious ocular complication of diabetes, is one
of the primary causes of vision loss among retinal vascular diseases. Deep
learning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when
applied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain
generalization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most
existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in
insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances
existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the
observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion
structures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a
plug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG
models. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural
representations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis.
Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in
both single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore,
visualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with
the intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling
insights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.

Motivation: 膝关节骨关节炎（KOA）是一种常见疾病，但现有MRI深度学习模型在不同数据源上的泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用实例归一化、数据增强和对比损失改进基线模型，并使用OAI数据库的MRI数据进行训练和评估。

Result: 改进方法在分类准确性上显著优于基线模型，且在不同数据域上表现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型在不同MRI数据源上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and
mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated
superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease
progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when
applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown
that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data
augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a
baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We
trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis
Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed
intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain
and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state
(DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically
significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with
our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Motivation: 腰椎间盘突出（LDH）的诊断依赖放射科医生的专业知识，导致诊断延迟和培训成本高。

Method: 使用205人的T1和T2加权MRI图像，结合数据增强和通道空间注意力机制提取特征并生成标准化诊断输出。

Result: AUC-ROC为0.969，准确率为0.9486，仅需少量数据集即可实现高诊断精度。

Conclusion: 该框架有望提升基层医院的LDH检测能力，为临床决策提供高效支持。

Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common musculoskeletal disease that
requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for effective clinical management.
However, the interpretation of MRI images heavily relies on the expertise of
radiologists, leading to delayed diagnosis and high costs for training
physicians. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative automated LDH
classification framework. To address these key issues, the framework utilizes
T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images from 205 people. The framework extracts
clinically actionable LDH features and generates standardized diagnostic
outputs by leveraging data augmentation and channel and spatial attention
mechanisms. These outputs can help physicians make confident and time-effective
care decisions when needed. The proposed framework achieves an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.969 and an accuracy of
0.9486 for LDH detection. The experimental results demonstrate the performance
of the proposed framework. Our framework only requires a small number of
datasets for training to demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy. This is expected
to be a solution to enhance the LDH detection capabilities of primary
hospitals.

Result: 掩模配准方法在左心室上Dice得分为0.819±0.045，速度提升了16.7倍。

Conclusion: 加速SMC算法在超声图像配准中表现出高效和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The perfect alignment of 3D echocardiographic images captured from various
angles has improved image quality and broadened the field of view. This study
proposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid
registration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and
limited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and
intensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the
translational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an
iterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and
translation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based
registration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the
apical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same
transform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based
registration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same
way. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D
temporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study
conducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. The evaluations
demonstrate that the mask-based approach of the accelerated SMC yielded a Dice
score value of 0.819 +/- 0.045 for the left ventricle and gained 16.7x speedup
compared to the CPU version of the SMC algorithm.

Motivation: 手动剥离fMRI中的颅骨耗时且依赖操作者，现有方法难以处理临床前数据的低分辨率和切片变化。

Method: 采用密集UNet架构与智能Swin Transformer特征提取器，结合Focal和Dice损失函数解决类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: SST-DUNet可有效替代手动颅骨剥离，适用于大鼠fMRI分析。

Abstract: Skull stripping is a common preprocessing step that is often performed
manually in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) pipelines, including functional
MRI (fMRI). This manual process is time-consuming and operator dependent.
Automating this process is challenging for preclinical data due to variations
in brain geometry, resolution, and tissue contrast. While existing methods for
MRI skull stripping exist, they often struggle with the low resolution and
varying slice sizes in preclinical fMRI data. This study proposes a novel
method called SST-DUNet, that integrates a dense UNet-based architecture with a
feature extractor based on Smart Swin Transformer (SST) for fMRI skull
stripping. The Smart Shifted Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (SSW-MSA) module
in SST is adapted to replace the mask-based module in the Swin Transformer
(ST), enabling the learning of distinct channel-wise features while focusing on
relevant dependencies within brain structures. This modification allows the
model to better handle the complexities of fMRI skull stripping, such as low
resolution and variable slice sizes. To address the issue of class imbalance in
preclinical data, a combined loss function using Focal and Dice loss is
utilized. The model was trained on rat fMRI images and evaluated across three
in-house datasets with a Dice similarity score of 98.65%, 97.86%, and 98.04%.
The fMRI results obtained through automatic skull stripping using the SST-DUNet
model closely align with those from manual skull stripping for both seed-based
and independent component analyses. These results indicate that the SST-DUNet
can effectively substitute manual brain extraction in rat fMRI analysis.

Result: 在情绪识别、睡眠阶段分类等四个任务中达到最优性能，且对缺失模态具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PhysioOmni为多模态生理信号分析提供了通用且鲁棒的解决方案，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial
for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on
specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle
to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle
missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose
PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis
that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal
signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility
with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal
tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and
modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete
modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning
with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four
downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor
prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing
modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

Conclusion: 研究为设计可扩展且高效的储层计算提供了理论基础，揭示了神经元相关性、线性记忆与非线性处理的关系。

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a powerful framework for real-time information
processing, characterized by its high computational ability and quick learning,
with applications ranging from machine learning to biological systems. In this
paper, we demonstrate that the memory capacity of a reservoir recurrent neural
network scales sublinearly with the number of readout neurons. To elucidate
this phenomenon, we develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving
memory capacity, attributing the decaying growth of memory capacity to neuronal
correlations. In addition, numerical simulations reveal that once memory
capacity becomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons
successively enables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial
orders. Furthermore, our theoretical framework suggests that neuronal
correlations govern not only memory capacity but also the sequential growth of
nonlinear computational capabilities. Our findings establish a foundation for
designing scalable and cost-effective reservoir computing, providing novel
insights into the interplay among neuronal correlations, linear memory, and
nonlinear processing.

Method: 利用潜在空间操作和空间注意力机制（SAU）隔离并移除后门触发的潜在表示。

Result: SAU在多种后门攻击中实现了100%的触发移除准确率，CLIP得分0.7023，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAU是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，能有效保护扩散模型免受后门攻击，同时保持图像生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where malicious modifications to the training data cause the model to
generate unintended outputs when specific triggers are present. While
classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms,
generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional
output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle
perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain
under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a
novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU
leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate
and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and
efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of
backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy.
Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing
methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality,
semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable,
and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against
backdoor attacks.

TL;DR: DualBreach是一种针对LLMs和Guardrails的双重越狱框架，通过目标驱动初始化和多目标优化方法，显著提高成功率并减少查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在绕过安全对齐的LLMs和保护机制时效果有限，因此需要研究双重越狱攻击。

Method: DualBreach采用目标驱动初始化（TDI）和多目标优化（MTO）方法，结合代理模型或开源保护机制，实现高效双重越狱。

Result: DualBreach在多个数据集上表现优异，成功率达93.67%，查询次数仅1.77次/成功。

Conclusion: DualBreach显著优于现有方法，同时提出的防御机制EGuard也表现出色。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on exploring the vulnerabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), aiming to elicit harmful and/or sensitive content from
LLMs. However, due to the insufficient research on dual-jailbreaking -- attacks
targeting both LLMs and Guardrails, the effectiveness of existing attacks is
limited when attempting to bypass safety-aligned LLMs shielded by guardrails.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose DualBreach, a target-driven framework for
dual-jailbreaking. DualBreach employs a Target-driven Initialization (TDI)
strategy to dynamically construct initial prompts, combined with a Multi-Target
Optimization (MTO) method that utilizes approximate gradients to jointly adapt
the prompts across guardrails and LLMs, which can simultaneously save the
number of queries and achieve a high dual-jailbreaking success rate. For
black-box guardrails, DualBreach either employs a powerful open-sourced
guardrail or imitates the target black-box guardrail by training a proxy model,
to incorporate guardrails into the MTO process.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of DualBreach in dual-jailbreaking scenarios
through extensive evaluation on several widely-used datasets. Experimental
results indicate that DualBreach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
fewer queries, achieving significantly higher success rates across all
settings. More specifically, DualBreach achieves an average dual-jailbreaking
success rate of 93.67% against GPT-4 with Llama-Guard-3 protection, whereas the
best success rate achieved by other methods is 88.33%. Moreover, DualBreach
only uses an average of 1.77 queries per successful dual-jailbreak,
outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. For the purpose of defense, we
propose an XGBoost-based ensemble defensive mechanism named EGuard, which
integrates the strengths of multiple guardrails, demonstrating superior
performance compared with Llama-Guard-3.

Method: 开发RepliBench评估套件，包含20个任务家族的86个任务，测试5个前沿模型在资源获取、权重窃取、计算复制和持久性四个核心领域的能力。

Result: 模型在简单安全设置下能完成部分任务，但在复杂场景（如KYC检查）中表现不佳。Claude 3.7 Sonnet在15/20任务家族中得分>50%。

Conclusion: 自主复制能力可能随着技术进步或人类协助而快速提升，需持续关注其安全风险。

Abstract: Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a
critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench,
a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities.
RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four
core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto
compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel
task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier
models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of
self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly.
Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write
self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security
setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent
deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50%
pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20
families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication
capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with
human assistance.

Motivation: DDoS攻击对现代网络系统构成持续威胁，传统特征选择方法在复杂攻击环境中存在可扩展性和适应性不足的问题。

Method: 提出GANFS方法，利用对抗学习动态识别关键特征，通过攻击流量训练GAN并结合扰动敏感性分析进行特征排序。

Conclusion: GANFS展示了生成学习模型在网络安全中的潜力，可构建更自适应和可扩展的检测系统。

Abstract: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent and
evolving threat to modern networked systems, capable of causing large-scale
service disruptions. The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within
high-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and
intelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional
methods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each
offer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack
environments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a
detailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to
large-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a
novel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method
that leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative
features. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively
ranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental
evaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only
improves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational
efficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality. These results
point to the potential of integrating generative learning models into
cybersecurity pipelines to build more adaptive and scalable detection systems.

Conclusion: LPPA为医疗数据隐私保护提供了一种有效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The de-identification of private information in medical data is a crucial
process to mitigate the risk of confidentiality breaches, particularly when
patient personal details are not adequately removed before the release of
medical records. Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been
proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require
substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in
addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension
capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy
risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying
open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered
Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the
English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA
ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying
private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing
patient privacy protection.

Result: 代理易受低复杂度提示注入攻击，但攻击成功率低（0-17%）。

Conclusion: 需开发更强攻击测试以验证代理在真实约束下的安全性。

Abstract: Web navigation AI agents use language-and-vision foundation models to enhance
productivity but these models are known to be susceptible to indirect prompt
injections that get them to follow instructions different from the legitimate
user's. Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus
on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are
either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary
unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we
construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt
injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and
an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the
live web. As part of WASP, we also develop baseline attacks against three
popular web agentic systems (VisualWebArena, Claude Computer Use, and Operator)
instantiated with various state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation shows that
even AI agents backed by models with advanced reasoning capabilities and by
models with instruction hierarchy mitigations are susceptible to low-effort
human-written prompt injections. However, the realistic objectives in WASP also
allow us to observe that agents are currently not capable enough to complete
the goals of attackers end-to-end. Agents begin executing the adversarial
instruction between 16 and 86% of the time but only achieve the goal between 0
and 17% of the time. Based on these findings, we argue that adversarial
researchers should demonstrate stronger attacks that more consistently maintain
control over the agent given realistic constraints on the adversary's power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在BFSI等行业中，如何在保护隐私的同时保持数据的高实用性是一个关键需求，传统方法难以平衡二者。

Method: 采用生成对抗网络（GANs）、上下文感知的PII转换、可配置统计扰动和差分隐私等先进技术。

Result: 这些方法显著提升了隐私保护与数据实用性的平衡，同时降低了运营成本并加速了分析流程。

Conclusion: 现代技术在隐私保护和数据实用性方面优于传统方法，适用于敏感行业的数据驱动创新。

Abstract: This paper explores the strategic use of modern synthetic data generation and
advanced data perturbation techniques to enhance security, maintain analytical
utility, and improve operational efficiency when managing large datasets, with
a particular focus on the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI)
sector. We contrast these advanced methods encompassing generative models like
GANs, sophisticated context-aware PII transformation, configurable statistical
perturbation, and differential privacy with traditional anonymization
approaches.
  The goal is to create realistic, privacy-preserving datasets that retain high
utility for complex machine learning tasks and analytics, a critical need in
the data-sensitive industries like BFSI, Healthcare, Retail, and
Telecommunications. We discuss how these modern techniques potentially offer
significant improvements in balancing privacy preservation while maintaining
data utility compared to older methods. Furthermore, we examine the potential
for operational gains, such as reduced overhead and accelerated analytics, by
using these privacy-enhanced datasets. We also explore key use cases where
these methods can mitigate regulatory risks and enable scalable, data-driven
innovation without compromising sensitive customer information.

*Qingyue Wang,Qi Pang,Xixun Lin,Shuai Wang,Daoyuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于MoE的LLM中的后门攻击，提出了一种名为BadMoE的攻击方法，通过毒害休眠专家和优化路由触发器来控制模型输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在LLM中表现出色，但其安全漏洞尤其是后门攻击尚未被充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 攻击方法包括识别与目标任务无关的休眠专家、构建路由感知损失优化触发器，以及通过毒害数据提升休眠专家的主导作用。

Result: 研究证明MoE模型中存在少数主导专家，休眠专家可被提升为主导专家以操纵模型预测。

Conclusion: BadMoE攻击成功利用了MoE架构的独特性，揭示了其安全风险，为未来防御研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have emerged as a powerful architecture for
  large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient scaling of model capacity
  while maintaining manageable computational costs. The key advantage lies in
  their ability to route different tokens to different ``expert'' networks
  within the model, enabling specialization and efficient handling of diverse
  input. However, the vulnerabilities of MoE-based LLMs still have barely been
  studied, and the potential for backdoor attacks in this context remains
  largely unexplored. This paper presents the first backdoor attack against
  MoE-based LLMs where the attackers poison ``dormant experts'' (i.e.,
underutilized
  experts) and activate them by optimizing routing triggers, thereby gaining
  control over the model's output. We first rigorously prove the existence of a
few ``dominating
  experts'' in MoE models, whose outputs can determine the overall MoE's
  output. We also show that dormant experts can serve as dominating experts to
manipulate model predictions.
  Accordingly, our attack, namely \textsc{BadMoE}, exploits the unique
  architecture of MoE models by 1) identifying dormant experts unrelated to the
target task, 2)
  constructing a routing-aware loss to optimize the activation triggers of
these experts, and 3) promoting dormant experts to dominating roles via
poisoned training data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模糊逻辑和梯度优化的新型钓鱼URL检测系统，兼具高准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有钓鱼检测方法难以同时实现高准确性和可解释性，导致无法检测新型攻击或模型不透明。

Method: 采用一阶Takagi-Sugeno-Kang模糊推理模型，结合梯度优化技术（Adam优化器）进行参数调优。

Result: 在23.5万URL数据集上测试，准确率达99.95%，AUC为1.00，模型收敛快且规则可解释。

Conclusion: 该框架为网络安全提供了高性能、透明且可解释的钓鱼检测工具，显著提升了防御能力。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent an increasingly sophisticated and pervasive threat
to individuals and organizations, causing significant financial losses,
identity theft, and severe damage to institutional reputations. Existing
phishing detection methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high
accuracy and explainability, either failing to detect novel attacks or
operating as opaque black-box models. To address this critical gap, we propose
a novel phishing URL detection system based on a first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang
(TSK) fuzzy inference model optimized through gradient-based techniques. Our
approach intelligently combines the interpretability and human-like reasoning
capabilities of fuzzy logic with the precision and adaptability provided by
gradient optimization methods, specifically leveraging the Adam optimizer for
efficient parameter tuning. Experiments conducted using a comprehensive dataset
of over 235,000 URLs demonstrate rapid convergence, exceptional predictive
performance (accuracy averaging 99.95% across 5 cross-validation folds, with a
perfect AUC i.e. 1.00). Furthermore, optimized fuzzy rules and membership
functions improve interoperability, clearly indicating how the model makes
decisions - an essential feature for cybersecurity applications. This
high-performance, transparent, and interpretable phishing detection framework
significantly advances current cybersecurity defenses, providing practitioners
with accurate and explainable decision-making tools.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于边缘计算的入侵检测系统（IDS），用于检测车联网（IoV）中的已知和未知攻击，通过元集成分类器和粒子群优化策略实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网（IoV）的互联性增加了安全风险，尤其是针对联网和自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的僵尸网络攻击，需要一种高效的检测方法。

Method: 使用多个隔离森林（IF）模型在边缘服务器上训练，并通过粒子群优化（PSO）策略集成，构建元分类器。

Result: 在车联网僵尸网络数据集上，对已知攻击的检测率为92.80%，对未知攻击为77.32%。

Conclusion: 该IDS系统能有效检测已知和新兴威胁，为车联网提供可扩展和自适应的防御机制。

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is transforming transportation by enhancing
connectivity and enabling autonomous driving. However, this increased
interconnectivity introduces new security vulnerabilities. Bot malware and
cyberattacks pose significant risks to Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
(CAVs), as demonstrated by real-world incidents involving remote vehicle system
compromise. To address these challenges, we propose an edge-based Intrusion
Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic to and from CAVs. Our
detection model is based on a meta-ensemble classifier capable of recognizing
known (Nday) attacks and detecting previously unseen (zero-day) attacks. The
approach involves training multiple Isolation Forest (IF) models on
Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with each IF specialized in
identifying a specific type of botnet attack. These IFs, either trained locally
or shared by other MEC nodes, are then aggregated using a Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) based stacking strategy to construct a robust
meta-classifier. The proposed IDS has been evaluated on a vehicular botnet
dataset, achieving an average detection rate of 92.80% for N-day attacks and
77.32% for zero-day attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
solution in detecting both known and emerging threats, providing a scalable and
adaptive defense mechanism for CAVs within the IoV ecosystem.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种攻击策略，通过避免残差显著变化来规避ADMM系统的检测，展示了其隐蔽性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测算法依赖残差变化识别攻击，但攻击者可通过保持残差不变绕过检测，揭示系统漏洞。

Method: 策略一结合随机起点与Gram-Schmidt正交化确保隐蔽性；策略二进一步针对经济收益操纵无功功率。

Result: 在IEEE 14-bus系统案例中验证了攻击有效性，对比显示隐蔽性与破坏力的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发更鲁棒的监测算法以应对高级攻击策略。

Abstract: This paper presents two attack strategies designed to evade detection in
ADMM-based systems by preventing significant changes to the residual during the
attacked iteration. While many detection algorithms focus on identifying false
data injection through residual changes, we show that our attacks remain
undetected by keeping the residual largely unchanged. The first strategy uses a
random starting point combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure
stealth, with potential for refinement by enhancing the orthogonal component to
increase system disruption. The second strategy builds on the first, targeting
financial gains by manipulating reactive power and pushing the system to its
upper voltage limit, exploiting operational constraints. The effectiveness of
the proposed attack-resilient mechanism is demonstrated through case studies on
the IEEE 14-bus system. A comparison of the two strategies, along with commonly
used naive attacks, reveals trade-offs between simplicity, detectability, and
effectiveness, providing insights into ADMM system vulnerabilities. These
findings underscore the need for more robust monitoring algorithms to protect
against advanced attack strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备在智能家居中的快速普及带来了安全和隐私问题，现有解决方案依赖云端检测或过时的白名单，效果不佳。

Method: 通过构建标记数据集和特征提取管道，利用机器学习对网络目的地进行二元分类（必要与非必要流量）。

Result: 在五种智能家居设备测试中，模型能准确识别并阻止非必要流量，包括未知目的地，且无需传统白名单。

Conclusion: ML-IoTrim展示了在大规模物联网环境中实时流量分类的潜力，推动了智能家居隐私保护的发展。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in
smart home environments, has introduced considerable security and privacy
concerns due to their persistent connectivity and interaction with cloud
services. Despite advancements in IoT security, effective privacy measures
remain uncovered, with existing solutions often relying on cloud-based threat
detection that exposes sensitive data or outdated allow-lists that inadequately
restrict non-essential network traffic. This work presents ML-IoTrim, a system
for detecting and mitigating non-essential IoT traffic (i.e., not influencing
the device operations) by analyzing network behavior at the edge, leveraging
Machine Learning to classify network destinations. Our approach includes
building a labeled dataset based on IoT device behavior and employing a
feature-extraction pipeline to enable a binary classification of essential vs.
non-essential network destinations. We test our framework in a consumer smart
home setup with IoT devices from five categories, demonstrating that the model
can accurately identify and block non-essential traffic, including previously
unseen destinations, without relying on traditional allow-lists. We implement
our solution on a home access point, showing the framework has strong potential
for scalable deployment, supporting near-real-time traffic classification in
large-scale IoT environments with hundreds of devices. This research advances
privacy-aware traffic control in smart homes, paving the way for future
developments in IoT device privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学和编码方面表现出色，但其在需要密码学专业知识的领域中的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入CipherBank基准测试，包含多种加密算法和真实场景问题，评估GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3等模型的性能。

Result: 发现通用聊天LLM与专注于推理的LLM之间存在显著差距，且后者在经典密码解密任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在密码推理中存在局限性，需进一步改进其能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
especially the recent advancements in reasoning, such as o1 and o3, pushing the
boundaries of AI. Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and
coding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic
expertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
in cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously
crafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14
subdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that
necessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank
incorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct
algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques.
We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and
cutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results
reveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose
chat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current
reasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption
tasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and
manipulating encrypted data. Through detailed analysis and error
investigations, we provide several key observations that shed light on the
limitations and potential improvement areas for LLMs in cryptographic
reasoning. These findings underscore the need for continuous advancements in
LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: The increasing capabilities of agentic multi-modal large reasoning models,
such as ChatGPT o3, have raised critical concerns regarding privacy leakage
through inadvertent image geolocation. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic and controlled study on the potential privacy risks associated with
visual reasoning abilities of ChatGPT o3. We manually collect and construct a
dataset comprising 50 real-world images that feature individuals alongside
privacy-relevant environmental elements, capturing realistic and sensitive
scenarios for analysis. Our experimental evaluation reveals that ChatGPT o3 can
predict user locations with high precision, achieving street-level accuracy
(within one mile) in 60% of cases. Through analysis, we identify key visual
cues, including street layout and front yard design, that significantly
contribute to the model inference success. Additionally, targeted occlusion
experiments demonstrate that masking critical features effectively mitigates
geolocation accuracy, providing insights into potential defense mechanisms. Our
findings highlight an urgent need for privacy-aware development for agentic
multi-modal large reasoning models, particularly in applications involving
private imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估方法难以适应多样化的应用场景和动态对话特性，可能导致潜在危害被忽视。

Method: 引入SAGE框架，利用系统感知的对抗用户模型进行多轮对话评估。

Result: 实验发现对话长度增加会加剧危害，模型行为因用户个性和场景不同而显著差异，部分模型通过过度拒绝策略减少危害但影响实用性。

Conclusion: 需要自适应和上下文特定的测试方法以确保LLM的安全部署。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made progress and
attracted academic interest, but it remains challenging to keep pace with the
rapid integration of LLMs across diverse applications. Different applications
expose users to various harms, necessitating application-specific safety
evaluations with tailored harms and policies. Another major gap is the lack of
focus on the dynamic and conversational nature of LLM systems. Such potential
oversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks.
This paper identifies the above as key requirements for robust LLM safety
evaluation and recognizing that current evaluation methodologies do not satisfy
these, we introduce the $\texttt{SAGE}$ (Safety AI Generic Evaluation)
framework. $\texttt{SAGE}$ is an automated modular framework designed for
customized and dynamic harm evaluations. It utilizes adversarial user models
that are system-aware and have unique personalities, enabling a holistic
red-teaming evaluation. We demonstrate $\texttt{SAGE}$'s effectiveness by
evaluating seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm
policies. Our experiments with multi-turn conversational evaluations revealed a
concerning finding that harm steadily increases with conversation length.
Furthermore, we observe significant disparities in model behavior when exposed
to different user personalities and scenarios. Our findings also reveal that
some models minimize harmful outputs by employing severe refusal tactics that
can hinder their usefulness. These insights highlight the necessity of adaptive
and context-specific testing to ensure better safety alignment and safer
deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) multi-agent systems (MAS) necessitates
standardized protocols enabling agents to discover and interact with external
tools. However, these protocols introduce new security challenges,
particularly; tool squatting; the deceptive registration or representation of
tools. This paper analyzes tool squatting threats within the context of
emerging interoperability standards, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) or
seamless communication between agents protocols. It introduces a comprehensive
Tool Registry system designed to mitigate these risks. We propose a
security-focused architecture featuring admin-controlled registration,
centralized tool discovery, fine grained access policies enforced via dedicated
Agent and Tool Registry services, a dynamic trust scoring mechanism based on
tool versioning and known vulnerabilities, and just in time credential
provisioning. Based on its design principles, the proposed registry framework
aims to effectively prevent common tool squatting vectors while preserving the
flexibility and power of multi-agent systems. This work addresses a critical
security gap in the rapidly evolving GenAI ecosystem and provides a foundation
for secure tool integration in production environments.

Result: 识别了9种主要威胁，分为五大领域，并提出了针对性的缓解策略。

Conclusion: GenAI代理需要全新的安全视角，否则可能成为企业的重大风险。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings,
they introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed
by traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember,
and act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a
comprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on
how their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool
integration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats
and organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture
vulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution
vulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These
threats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as
delayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral
movement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing
frameworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work
present two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for
Autonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a
framework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce
enterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI
security, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those
differences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require
a new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to
account for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful
new tool into a serious enterprise liability.

Conclusion: 该方法统一了动态推断与熵产生估计，揭示了机器学习扩散模型与随机热力学的深层联系。

Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to
growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer
a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a
complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external
environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it
crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems
obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning
framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased
attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic
uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between
the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using
this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly
from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a
TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other
methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions
for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to
per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far
from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is
straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy
production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between
diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in
stochastic thermodynamics.

offering a scalable, GPU-accelerated alternative to full Geant4-based

enables both DL researchers and physicists to efficiently generate
high-fidelity large-scale datasets on demand, without relying on complex

Abstract: This paper introduces the application of the Brain Drain Optimization
algorithm -- a swarm-based metaheuristic inspired by the emigration of
intellectual elites -- to the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem, a classic
combinatorial optimization problem, serves as a challenge for applying the
BRADO. A designed cost function guides the search, and the configurations are
tuned using a TOPSIS-based multicriteria decision making process. BRADO
consistently outperforms alternatives in terms of solution quality, achieving
fewer threats and better objective function values. To assess BRADO's efficacy,
it is benchmarked against several established metaheuristic algorithms,
including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA),
Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), Iterated Local Search (ILS), and basic
Local Search (LS). The study highlights BRADO's potential as a general-purpose
solver for combinatorial problems, opening pathways for future applications in
other domains of artificial intelligence.
