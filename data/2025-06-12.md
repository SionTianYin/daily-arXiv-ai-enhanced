### [1] [LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge: automating error analysis in natural language generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09147)
*Nadezhda Chirkova,Tunde Oluwaseyi Ajayi,Seth Aycock,Zain Muhammad Mujahid,Vladana Perlić,Ekaterina Borisova,Markarit Vartampetian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的定性评估方法（LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge），通过结构化报告分析NLG系统输出的常见问题类型，为开发者提供改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估工具主要用于定量分析（如数值评分），缺乏对问题的定性分析，无法为NLG系统改进提供具体指导。

Method: 采用两步法：1）对每个实例进行开放式问题分析；2）使用累积算法聚类发现的问题。

Result: 在2/3的情况下能正确识别实例特定问题，并能生成与人工标注相似的问题类型报告。

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge方法有效，能为NLG系统改进提供具体且有意义的见解。

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/tunde-ajayi/llm-as-a-qualitative-judge.

### [2] [PHRASED: Phrase Dictionary Biasing for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09175)
*Peidong Wang,Jian Xue,Rui Zhao,Junkun Chen,Aswin Shanmugam Subramanian,Jinyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种短语词典偏置方法，用于提升语音翻译任务中短语翻译的准确性，并在流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于短语在训练数据中罕见，导致语音翻译任务中短语翻译困难，因此需要一种方法来提升短语翻译的准确性。

Method: 提出短语词典偏置方法，利用源语言到目标语言的短语映射对，应用于流式语音翻译模型和多模态大语言模型。

Result: 短语词典偏置方法在流式语音翻译模型中相对短语列表偏置方法提升了21%，在多模态大语言模型中实现了85%的相对短语召回率提升。

Conclusion: 短语词典偏置方法显著提升了短语翻译的准确性，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list
biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In
addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to
use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase
recall.

### [3] [A Technique for Isolating Lexically-Independent Phonetic Dependencies in Generative CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09218)
*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了深度神经网络（DNNs）在语音学泛化能力上的表现，提出了一种在窄全连接层瓶颈下探测模型泛化能力的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DNNs是否能从词汇学习中提取语音学泛化能力，以及全连接层瓶颈大小对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 使用生成式卷积神经网络（CNNs）训练原始音频波形，并通过缩小全连接层（FC）瓶颈至8通道，提出一种绕过FC输入随机特征图的新技术。

Result: 卷积层能够动态泛化语音依赖关系，超越FC学习的词汇约束配置。

Conclusion: 窄FC瓶颈下，卷积层展现了独立的语音学泛化能力，为模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

### [4] [Extrapolation by Association: Length Generalization Transfer in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09251)
*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，Transformer模型可以通过任务关联实现长度泛化的转移，即通过训练相关辅助任务提升目标任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer模型如何通过任务关联实现长度泛化，以理解其泛化机制。

Method: 通过训练模型在相关任务上（如算术、字符串变换、迷宫导航）进行长度泛化，观察其是否能够迁移到目标任务。

Result: 模型能够通过任务关联实现长度泛化的转移，且预训练语言模型也表现出类似效果。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够通过任务关联和注意力头复用实现长度泛化，揭示了其泛化能力的组合性。

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [5] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的自锚注意力模型（SAAM），用于识别和分类游戏聊天中的亲社会行为，相比现有技术提升了7.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注毒性内容检测，而亲社会行为识别同样重要但缺乏资源。

Method: 结合无监督发现与游戏领域专家合作，提出SAAM模型，利用整个训练集作为锚点提升性能。

Result: 在《使命召唤：现代战争II》中验证了模型有效性，开发了首个自动化亲社会行为分类系统。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线平台从惩罚毒性转向鼓励积极互动提供了新工具。

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

### [6] [Did I Faithfully Say What I Thought? Bridging the Gap Between Neural Activity and Self-Explanations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09277)
*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过比较LLM生成的自我自然语言解释（self-NLE）与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量测量其忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖行为测试或计算块识别，未能深入模型推理的神经活动，导致无法准确评估self-NLE的忠实性。

Method: 引入灵活框架，直接比较self-NLE与模型内部隐藏状态的解释，定量测量忠实性。

Result: 该框架提供了对self-NLE忠实性的深入理解，并为生成更忠实的self-NLE奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过连接self-NLE与模型推理，该方法推动了self-NLE忠实性的研究，并提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

### [7] [$(RSA)^2$: A Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware Rational Speech Act Framework for Figurative Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09301)
*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了$(RSA)^2$框架，通过考虑说话者的修辞策略来解释比喻语言，无需建模其动机，结合LLMs在讽刺解释任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比喻语言在人类交流中普遍存在，但现有RSA框架无法解释或需特定建模其动机。

Method: 引入$(RSA)^2$框架，结合修辞策略建模比喻语言。

Result: $(RSA)^2$在讽刺解释数据集PragMega+上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: $(RSA)^2$为比喻语言解释提供了一种无需动机建模的有效方法。

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

### [8] [Alzheimer's Dementia Detection Using Perplexity from Paired Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09315)
*Yao Xiao,Heidi Christensen,Stefan Goetze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Mistral-7B大语言模型的配对困惑度方法，用于检测阿尔茨海默病（AD），显著提高了检测准确率，并提供了可解释的决策边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）常伴随语言能力下降，现有检测方法准确率有限且决策过程不透明。

Method: 采用Mistral-7B大语言模型的配对困惑度方法，并通过提示微调模型分析语言模式。

Result: 新方法比现有最佳方法准确率提高3.33%，比ADReSS 2020基准方法提高6.35%，且决策边界清晰可解释。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了AD检测性能，还为模型解释和数据增强提供了新思路。

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [9] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一系列新方法（Lion、WebR、LTE、BMC和FollowBench），以改进大型语言模型（LLM）与人类期望的对齐，涵盖数据收集、训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多任务中表现出色，但如何高效且有效地使其与人类期望对齐仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 1. Lion框架通过对抗蒸馏优化训练数据；2. WebR从原始网页自动合成数据；3. LTE框架通过元学习实现知识更新；4. BMC改进DPO以捕捉偏好数据中的相关性；5. FollowBench评估模型对复杂约束的遵循能力。

Result: 提出的方法在零样本推理、数据多样性、知识更新和约束遵循等方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 这些方法为LLM对齐提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案，并揭示了当前模型在约束遵循上的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Language Models: Advancing Cooperation, Coordination, and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09331)
*Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具备心智理论（ToM）能力，并通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架验证其协作潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在零样本和少样本任务中表现优异，但其是否能理解他人意图（ToM）尚不明确。理解意图对协作至关重要，尤其在人类与AI交互中。

Method: 通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）框架，研究LLMs在协作任务中的表现，验证其是否具备ToM能力。

Result: LLMs在协作任务中展现出一定的意图推理能力，表明其可能具备初步的ToM能力。

Conclusion: LLMs具备潜在的ToM能力，为未来人机协作系统的发展提供了可能。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

*Siheng Li,Zhanhui Zhou,Wai Lam,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RePO是一种新的强化学习方法，通过利用多样化的回放策略从回放缓冲区中检索离策略样本，显著提升了大型语言模型的优化效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO方法因使用多个同策略输出导致的高计算成本和低数据效率问题。

Method: 引入RePO，利用回放缓冲区中的离策略样本进行策略优化，增加样本多样性。

Result: 在五个LLM和七个数学推理基准测试中，RePO显著提升了性能（如Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B提升18.4分），同时计算成本仅增加15%，有效优化步骤增加48%。

Conclusion: RePO通过结合离策略样本，显著提升了数据效率和模型性能，是一种高效的强化学习优化方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository
can be accessed at https://github.com/SihengLi99/RePO.

### [12] [Latent Multi-Head Attention for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09342)
*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在小型语言模型中，使用带有旋转位置嵌入的潜在多头注意力（MLA+RoPE）可以在减少45% KV缓存内存的同时，仅增加0.3%的验证损失，实现效率与质量的帕累托改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索小型语言模型中潜在多头注意力（MLA）的效率与质量权衡，为内存受限的部署提供优化方案。

Method: 训练30M参数的GPT模型，比较标准多头注意力（MHA）、MLA和MLA+RoPE三种架构变体，重点关注半秩潜在维度（r=d/2）的效果。

Result: MLA+RoPE在减少内存的同时几乎保持质量，推理速度提升1.4倍，GPT-4评估显示其在语法、创造力和一致性方面得分最高（7.4/10）。

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE是小型语言模型的高效替代方案，尤其适合内存受限场景，RoPE对MLA性能至关重要。

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

*Yuchen Feng,Bowen Shen,Naibin Gu,Jiaxuan Zhao,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVE是一种多样性增强的重构方法，通过领域亲和性挖掘、剪枝和重组FFN模块，高效训练路由器和专家模块，提升MoE LLMs的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE LLMs重构方法忽视专家多样性，导致冗余，而DIVE通过剪枝和多样性增强解决这一问题。

Method: DIVE包括领域亲和性挖掘、剪枝重组FFN模块，以及对路由器、专家和归一化模块的高效再训练。

Result: 实验表明，DIVE在保持准确性的同时显著提升训练效率，优于现有剪枝和MoE重构方法。

Conclusion: DIVE通过多样性增强和高效重构，为MoE LLMs提供了一种低成本高效益的训练方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLM）评估生成的SQL语义等价性，尤其是针对模糊查询和多解情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于用户查询的模糊性和SQL的多解性，评估生成的SQL的语义等价性具有挑战性。

Method: 使用LLM评估语义和“弱”语义等价性，分析SQL等价和非等价模式。

Result: 讨论了LLM评估的挑战和常见SQL等价模式。

Conclusion: LLM在评估SQL语义等价性方面具有潜力，但仍需解决相关挑战。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
Text-to-SQL (NL2SQL) systems, yet evaluating the semantic equivalence of
generated SQL remains a challenge, especially given ambiguous user queries and
multiple valid SQL interpretations. This paper explores using LLMs to assess
both semantic and a more practical "weak" semantic equivalence. We analyze
common patterns of SQL equivalence and inequivalence, discuss challenges in
LLM-based evaluation.

*Zhengyuan Liu,Stella Xin Yin,Dion Hoe-Lian Goh,Nancy F. Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COGENT是一个面向课程的框架，用于生成适合年级的教育内容，解决了生成式AI在教育中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在教育中的应用常因不符合课程标准和阅读水平而受限，尤其是在STEM教育中。

Method: COGENT整合了科学概念、核心思想和学习目标，控制可读性，并采用“基于好奇”的方法。

Result: 实验表明，COGENT生成的文本质量与人工参考相当或更优。

Conclusion: COGENT为扩展高质量学习资源提供了可行方法。

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RuleReasoner的方法，通过动态采样和强化学习提升小推理模型（SRMs）在规则推理任务中的表现，显著优于大型推理模型（LRMs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小推理模型在多样任务和领域中规则推理的泛化能力问题，避免依赖人工设计的混合训练方法。

Method: 采用动态采样技术，根据历史奖励调整不同领域的采样权重，支持领域增强和灵活的在线学习。

Result: 在ID和OOD任务上表现优于前沿LRMs（ID任务提升4.1%，OOD任务提升10.4%），且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: RuleReasoner是一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了小推理模型的规则推理能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoLMbo是一种新型的说话人语言模型，通过结合说话人编码器和提示条件，生成详细的说话人描述，解决了传统说话人识别系统在提取人口统计属性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统说话人识别系统仅能完成分类任务，无法生成详细的说话人特征或上下文丰富的描述，尤其是在人口统计属性（如方言、性别、年龄）的提取上表现不足。

Method: CoLMbo结合说话人编码器和基于提示的条件，通过用户定义的提示动态适应新说话人特征，生成定制化描述。

Result: CoLMbo在传统说话人分析和零样本场景中表现优异，能够生成包括方言和年龄特征在内的详细描述。

Conclusion: CoLMbo在说话人识别领域实现了显著进步，特别是在生成上下文丰富的说话人描述方面。

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related
traits. This innovative approach not only enhances traditional speaker
profiling but also excels in zero-shot scenarios across diverse datasets,
marking a significant advancement in the field of speaker recognition.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何自动区分低质量与高质量新闻标题/链接，评估了12种机器学习模型，发现传统集成方法和深度学习模型均有效，但后者训练时间更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻的泛滥导致低质量新闻标题/链接广泛传播，研究旨在自动区分其质量。

Method: 使用包含57,544,214条新闻标题/链接的数据集，提取115种语言特征，评估12种模型，包括传统集成方法和深度学习模型（如DistilBERT）。

Result: 传统集成方法（如Bagging分类器）表现良好（88.1%准确率），而微调的DistilBERT准确率最高（90.3%），但训练时间更长。

Conclusion: NLP特征结合传统分类器或深度学习模型均可有效区分新闻质量，但需权衡预测性能与训练时间。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否具备人类在礼貌用语上的语境敏感能力，以平衡信息与社交目标。

Method: 通过约束性和开放性任务比较人类与LLM的回答，分析其礼貌策略。

Result: 大模型能复制人类偏好，但过度使用负面礼貌策略，可能导致误解。

Conclusion: LLMs在礼貌策略上表现优秀，但细微差异引发AI系统语用对齐问题。

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源课堂环境中知识追踪的挑战，利用层次化知识概念提供先验。

Method: 提出基于树状知识层次结构的隐马尔可夫树模型，使用EM算法估计学生掌握程度，支持增量更新。

Result: 在低资源在线设置中，KT$^2$表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KT$^2$通过层次化知识结构和增量更新机制，有效提升了低资源条件下的知识追踪性能。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Token Constraint Decoding (TCD)，一种简单有效的推理时算法，通过增强token级预测的一致性来提升LLMs在噪声环境下的鲁棒性。实验表明TCD显著恢复性能，尤其与提示工程结合时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在MCQA任务中表现优异，但对输入扰动高度敏感，需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TCD算法，通过约束token级预测的一致性，结合提示工程提升性能。

Result: TCD在CommonsenseQA等数据集上显著恢复性能，尤其对弱模型效果明显（如Gemma3 1B提升39%）。

Conclusion: TCD是一种实用且模型无关的方法，可提升LLMs在现实不完美条件下的推理稳定性，适用于安全关键或用户交互场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGQA方法在多样注释数据和多跳推理样本上表现不足，传统数据增强方法易导致语义失真，而基于LLM的方法则忽视多跳推理。

Method: PGDA-KGQA采用统一提示设计范式，生成大规模（问题，逻辑形式）对，包括单跳伪问题生成、语义保留问题重写和答案引导的反向路径探索。

Result: 在WebQSP和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上，PGDA-KGQA在F1、Hits@1和准确率上分别提升了2.8%、1.2%、3.1%和1.8%、1.1%、2.4%。

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA通过增强数据多样性和语义解析能力，显著提升了KGQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

Motivation: 在数字化世界中，检测欺骗是一项关键且具有挑战性的任务，需要评估现有模型的性能。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本方法，结合随机或基于相似性的上下文示例选择，评估LLMs和LMMs在三个数据集上的表现。

Result: 微调后的LLMs在文本欺骗检测中达到最优性能，而LMMs未能充分利用多模态线索。辅助特征和提示策略对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: LLMs在欺骗检测中具有潜力，但LMMs在多模态应用上仍需改进。

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的SFT方法，减少灾难性遗忘，同时提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT会削弱LLMs的通用能力，且第三方实施时因无法访问原始数据而加剧遗忘问题。

Method: 重构基础模型的SFT指令分布，筛选最优数据并与新数据混合用于SFT。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持通用领域能力的同时提升了任务性能。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了SFT中的灾难性遗忘问题，且更具成本效益。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Conclusion: UniToMBench揭示了当前LLMs在ToM任务中的优势和局限性，为未来开发提供了全面工具。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出POET方法，通过截断响应长度解决DAAs中的奖励-生成差距问题，实验显示性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现DAAs（如DPO和SimPO）存在奖励-生成差距，即训练目标与生成性能不匹配，原因是前缀令牌的重要性未被充分反映。

Method: 提出POET方法，截断偏好和非偏好响应至相同长度，使优化目标更关注前缀令牌。

Result: POET在DPO和SimPO上表现优于标准实现，AlpacaEval 2提升15.6分，下游任务均有改进。

Conclusion: 解决奖励优化与生成性能的不匹配对DAAs至关重要，POET方法简单有效。

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

Method: 采用计算自下而上、混合和专家驱动的自上而下方法，分析181个自杀未遂者和134个对照者的YouTube频道数据。

Result: 发现五个与自杀未遂相关的主题，其中两个随时间变化显著；专家未识别的平台特定指标（如YouTube互动）具有价值。

Conclusion: 综合方法提供了对自杀行为的深入理解，连接了数字行为与临床见解。

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLM）的性能重现性脆弱，系统配置（如GPU数量、类型和评估批次大小）会导致显著差异，尤其是推理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLM性能重现性问题，量化数值精度对推理输出的影响。

Method: 通过控制实验分析硬件、软件和精度设置对模型输出的影响，并提出轻量级推理管道LayerCast。

Result: GPU配置和数值精度差异导致推理模型准确率变化高达9%，响应长度差异达9,000词。

Conclusion: 数值精度对LLM重现性至关重要，LayerCast在内存效率和数值稳定性间取得平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的旋转位置嵌入方法（RoPE），解决了Transformer和SSM在位置编码上的不一致问题，并构建了混合模型\model，显著提升了训练和推理速度及准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer和SSM在长序列建模中各有优势，但两者的位置编码机制不同（RoPE与卷积隐含表示），导致集成时性能下降。

Method: 提出统一的RoPE方法，构建混合模型\model，结合Transformer和SSM层。

Result: 在4K序列长度下，\model训练和推理速度分别提升42.3%和29.5%，语言建模任务准确率提高4%以上，且扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 统一位置编码解决了混合模型的位置不兼容问题，实现了高效、高性能的长上下文建模。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Motivation: 尽管基于推理的大语言模型在数学和编程方面表现出色，但在知识密集型医学问答中的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建ReasonMed数据集（370k高质量示例），通过多代理验证和优化过程，设计Error Refiner改进推理路径。结合详细推理和简洁答案摘要的策略训练模型。

Result: ReasonMed-7B在性能上超越了之前的模型，表现优于之前最佳模型4.17%，并在PubMedQA上超过LLaMA3.1-70B 4.60%。

Conclusion: ReasonMed数据集和训练策略为医学推理模型提供了新的基准，展示了结合详细推理和简洁答案摘要的有效性。

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法依赖单一知识源且缺乏认知启发的知识激活机制，限制了其事实准确性和推理能力。

Method: 提出KG-Infused RAG框架，整合知识图谱实现扩散激活，扩展查询并结合结构化事实与文本段落生成响应，并通过偏好学习优化关键步骤。

Result: 在五个QA基准测试中，KG-Infused RAG性能提升3.8%至13.8%，且作为插件进一步增强了Self-RAG的效果。

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG是一种高效、可扩展的多源检索增强生成方法，适用于提升基于语料的RAG系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Motivation: 由于人类情感的主观性及其在自然条件下的不均衡表现，情感识别（SER）是一项具有挑战性的任务。

Method: MEDUSA采用四阶段训练流程，前两阶段训练基于DeepSER的集成分类器，后两阶段优化可训练的元分类器，结合了多种技术如Manifold MixUp和多任务学习。

Result: MEDUSA在Interspeech 2025挑战赛的情感识别任务中排名第一。

Conclusion: MEDUSA通过多模态和集成学习方法，显著提升了情感识别的性能。

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively
handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an
ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human
annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and
multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Google Translate和DeepL在英语到希腊语翻译中的性别偏见问题，并测试了GPT-4o作为缓解工具的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对包容性语言需求的增加，机器翻译系统可能强化性别刻板印象的问题引起关注。

Method: 研究使用GendEL数据集（240个句子），分析性别偏见的三方面：男性偏见、职业刻板印象和反刻板印象翻译错误，并测试GPT-4o的缓解能力。

Result: 发现MT系统在性别明确时表现良好，但在性别未指定时无法实现包容性翻译；GPT-4o在多数模糊情况下能生成合适的性别化或中性替代方案。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4o显示出潜力，但性别偏见问题仍需进一步解决。

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球技术普及需求增长，但LLM在低资源语言（如马其顿语）中的应用受限，需开发相关资源以推动研究。

Method: 收集40GB马其顿语语料库（3.5B词）、106k指令数据集，构建7个基准测试套件，训练8B参数模型domestic-yak。

Result: domestic-yak在8B参数范围内表现最优，性能接近10倍大模型，且文化适应性和语法正确性更受母语者青睐。

Conclusion: 公开所有资源（数据集、代码、模型权重），为类似低资源语言的LLM研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs,
categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which
improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question

and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and
highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to
existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational
efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions,
including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability,
and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，语言模型（LMs）在训练过程中容易记忆数据，导致隐私和知识产权泄露风险。本文探讨了潜在空间中的序列结构复杂性（通过Intrinsic Dimension衡量）对记忆率的影响，发现高复杂性的序列更难被记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在训练中无意记忆数据的问题，探索潜在结构（如Intrinsic Dimension）如何调节记忆率。

Method: 研究Intrinsic Dimension（ID）作为序列结构复杂性的几何代理，分析其对记忆率的影响，特别是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露情况下。

Result: 高ID序列比低ID序列更难被记忆，尤其是在过参数化模型和稀疏暴露条件下。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型规模、数据暴露和结构复杂性在记忆行为中的相互作用，为减少隐私泄露提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

<details>

Motivation: LLM标注虽然廉价但存在不一致性，可能影响下游参数估计，需要去偏方法结合少量专家标注以提升准确性。

Method: 通过实验比较Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)和Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI)在不同任务和样本量下的表现。

Result: DSL在偏差减少和效率上通常优于PPI，但其表现不稳定；PPI在大数据集下表现良好。

Conclusion: 去偏方法存在偏差-方差权衡，需进一步研究量化其在有限样本下的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Result: N-gram模型表现最佳，但信息论公式的加入显著提升了NDL模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调需结合频率、上下文可预测性及平均可预测性，并整合信息论指标与判别学习信息以优化声学缩减建模。

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的手语翻译系统提供了更稳健和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

### [45] [Is Fine-Tuning an Effective Solution? Reassessing Knowledge Editing for Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09672)
*Hao Xiong,Chuanyuan Tan,Wenliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的非结构化知识编辑（UKE）方法，解决了现有方法在局部性评估和微调（FT）异常失败方面的问题。通过构建新数据集和实验分析，提出了一种优化的FT-UKE方法，其性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化知识编辑（UKE）对更新LLMs的知识至关重要，但现有方法缺乏局部性评估且微调方法表现异常。

Method: 构建两个数据集（UnKEBench-Loc和AKEW-Loc），分析影响FT方法的四个因素，并提出优化的FT-UKE方法。

Result: 优化的FT-UKE方法在性能上显著优于现有技术，尤其在批量编辑场景中优势更明显。

Conclusion: FT-UKE方法为非结构化知识编辑提供了有效的解决方案，未来研究可基于此进一步优化。

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于逆模型的概率框架，用于量化大型语言模型的不确定性，并引入新的不确定性度量Inv-Entropy和扰动算法GAAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法缺乏概率基础，且多为启发式。论文旨在为LLMs的不确定性提供理论支持并提出更灵活的框架。

Method: 通过双随机游走视角建模输入-输出对，提出基于逆模型的概率框架，并定义Inv-Entropy度量。采用遗传算法扰动策略（GAAP）增强输入多样性。

Result: 实验表明Inv-Entropy优于现有语义不确定性量化方法。新评估指标TSU直接评估不确定性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的框架灵活且有效，为LLMs的不确定性量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code
to reproduce the results can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的工作流定制需要专业知识，现有方法学习曲线陡峭，ComfyUI-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用4K工作流数据集构建长链推理数据，通过CoT微调和强化学习训练7B参数模型。

Result: 模型在格式有效性、节点和图形级别F1分数上显著优于GPT-4o和Claude系列。

Conclusion: 长链推理和代码化工作流对AI艺术创作具有重要潜力。

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了18种指令调优的大语言模型（LLMs）在多项选择题测试中的反应是否具有人类相似性或心理测量合理性，发现校准后较大模型的反应更接近人类，但总体相关性不强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能模拟人类测试行为以加速测试开发，减少对真人试验的依赖。

Method: 基于经典测试理论和项目反应理论，评估LLMs在阅读、美国历史和经济学三个科目中的反应分布。

Result: 较大模型过于自信，但经温度校准后反应更接近人类；阅读理解的LLMs与人类相关性较高，但总体相关性不强。

Conclusion: LLMs在零样本设置下不适合直接用于教育评估的预测试。

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂数学运算中效率低或准确性不足，直接结合代码解释器效果不佳。

Method: 通过Hint-Engineering合成代码集成推理数据，结合监督微调、拒绝微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: 模型在五个数学推理数据集上性能提升4%-8%，计算开销减少30%-50%。

Conclusion: CoRT框架有效解决了LRMs与CI结合的技术挑战，显著提升了数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音情感识别数据集在情感粒度、隐私问题或依赖表演数据方面存在局限性，需要更全面的评估资源。

Method: 利用先进的语音生成技术合成模拟情感场景的音频片段，并通过心理学专家验证情感强度标签。

Result: 提出的Empathic Insight Voice模型在语音情感识别上表现优异，高唤醒情感（如愤怒）比低唤醒情感（如专注）更容易检测。

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice为语音情感识别提供了隐私保护且全面的评估工具，填补了现有数据集的空白。

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

Motivation: 现有方法仅关注图像语义与文本叙事的匹配，忽略了来源信息的准确性，导致误判。

Method: 构建了News Media Provenance Dataset，设计了LOR和DTOR两个任务，并测试了六种LLMs的基线性能。

Result: 零样本LOR表现良好，但DTOR表现较差，需进一步优化架构。

Conclusion: 来源信息检测仍需改进，未来可开发专用架构提升DTOR性能。

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Result: 在数学和常识推理任务中显著提高了推理效率，减少了token使用且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升语言模型的推理性能和成本效益提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法为幻觉检测提供了鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享神经元实现跨语言抽象思维，为训练策略提供新方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

Conclusion: PersonaLens为提升对话AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

Conclusion: VerIF可集成到现有RL方法中，提升模型性能而不影响通用能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

Conclusion: QRHEAD和QR-RETRIEVER为通用检索器，同时增强了对长上下文能力的解释性。

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Resa是一种1.5B推理模型，通过稀疏自编码器调优（SAE-Tuning）高效提取推理能力，显著降低训练成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何高效且低成本地激发语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用SAE-Tuning方法，先训练稀疏自编码器提取源模型的推理能力，再通过监督微调将其迁移到目标模型。

Result: SAE-Tuning在极低成本（约1美元）和短时间（约20分钟）内实现接近RL训练的推理性能（>97%），并在轻量RL训练后进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning提取的推理能力具有通用性和模块化特性，且方法高效、低成本。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

*Hillary Dawkins,Kathleen C. Fraser,Svetlana Kiritchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了社交媒体上AI生成文本的检测问题，发现现有方法在攻击者不公开微调模型的情况下检测效果显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体是网络影响力活动的重要攻击载体，AI生成的大量帖子可能被用于支持或反对特定政策或事件，因此检测此类内容至关重要。

Method: 研究团队以威胁行为者的视角，创建了一个包含505,159条AI生成社交媒体帖子的数据集，涵盖11个争议话题，并测试了不同检测算法的效果。

Result: 在攻击者不公开微调模型的现实假设下，检测效果大幅下降，人类实验也证实了这一结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，微调模型对检测算法构成普遍挑战，这对所有检测领域均有重要影响。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准提示方法在依赖解析任务中难以生成结构有效且准确的输出。

Method: 采用逐步指令策略，先进行通用词性标注，再预测句法头和依赖标签，并使用简化的CoNLL-U格式输出。

Result: 在17种语言的Universal Dependencies数据集上达到最高准确率，无幻觉或污染，且多语言微调提升了跨语言泛化性能。

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤在基于LLM的解析中有效，提供了一种可扩展且格式一致的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线有毒语言对资源有限地区造成实际危害，本研究旨在填补这些语言在毒性检测方面的数据空白。

Method: 构建并手动标注了4,500条YouTube和TikTok评论数据集，测试了四种模型在零样本和上下文增强模式下的表现。

Result: 上下文增强模式平均提升召回率0.12，F1分数最高提升0.10；Gemini在上下文增强模式下表现最佳，F1分数和准确率均为0.82。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过优化提示设计和阈值校准，可以在资源匮乏的巴尔干语言社区中显著提升毒性检测效果。

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持部分检测的数据与模型解决方案，通过构建FineHarm数据集和提出流式内容监控器（SCM），显著提高了检测效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核器通常基于完整输出进行检测，导致高延迟；而部分检测方法直接应用全检测训练的模型，存在性能下降问题。

Method: 构建FineHarm数据集（29K对），提出SCM模型，采用响应和令牌级双重监督训练。

Result: SCM仅需观察前18%的令牌即可达到与全检测相当的F1分数（0.95+），并能提升安全性对齐效果。

Conclusion: SCM是一种高效的流式检测方法，显著优于传统方法，同时可作为伪有害标注器提升安全性对齐。

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet是一种可重用和可拼接的网络，通过动态拼接两个预训练模型来适应不同设备的资源限制，解决了传统压缩方法的灵活性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习的发展，预训练模型在异构计算和内存资源的物联网设备上部署困难，传统压缩方法缺乏灵活性。

Method: ReStNet通过计算层间相似性（CKA）选择拼接点，保留大模型的早期层和小模型的深层，仅微调拼接层。

Result: 实验表明，ReStNet能在运行时灵活调整精度与效率，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ReStNet为异构设备提供了一种高效的模型部署方案，支持跨模型家族的灵活拼接。

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的推理时间防御策略，用于增强生成式医学视觉语言模型（Med-VLMs）的安全性，防止有害查询，同时避免过度防御影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs在生成复杂医学文本信息时面临安全漏洞，需要拒绝有害查询（如保险欺诈指令），但现有机制可能导致过度防御，影响正常临床查询。

Method: 提出基于合成临床演示的推理时间防御策略，通过多样化的医学影像数据集验证其有效性，并引入混合演示策略以平衡安全性和性能。

Result: 实验表明，该策略能有效防御视觉和文本越狱攻击，且增加演示预算可缓解过度防御问题。

Conclusion: 混合演示策略在少样本演示预算限制下，为Med-VLMs的安全性和性能提供了平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

Motivation: 提升建筑信息模型和计算机辅助设计的效率，自动分割墙体和窗户是关键步骤。

Method: 提出SAAF模型，结合多模态语义协作特征提取机制和端到端训练框架，融合文本描述与图像特征。

Result: 在多个立面数据集上实验，SAAF的mIoU指标优于现有方法，展现高精度分割能力。

Conclusion: SAAF在墙体和窗户分割任务中提升了准确性和泛化能力，为建筑计算机视觉技术和多模态学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Conclusion: VersaVid-R1是首个在Reason-Then-Respond范式下处理多种视频任务的模型，表现卓越。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQA基准测试存在数据分布不匹配和多能力耦合的问题，导致难以准确评估VFMs的视觉能力。

Method: 引入AVA-Bench，通过解耦14种AVAs并在每种能力内匹配训练和测试分布，精准评估VFMs的表现。

Result: AVA-Bench揭示了VFMs的独特“能力指纹”，并发现较小的LLM（0.5B）在评估效率上优于较大的LLM（7B）。

Conclusion: AVA-Bench为下一代VFMs的发展提供了全面且透明的评估基础。

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中大规模数据标注的耗时和易错问题。

Method: 结合手动修正、数据增强、标签传播和基于改进YOLOE的自动标注模块。

Result: 显著减少标注工作量，提升效率，适用于动态数据集。

Conclusion: BakuFlow在对象检测和跟踪任务中表现出色，适用于实际工业场景。

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

Method: 训练一组无条件图像生成模型，采用常用偏见评估框架分析训练与生成分布间的偏见偏移。

Result: 实验显示偏见偏移较小，但属性分类器的决策边界对结果影响显著，尤其在连续属性上。

Conclusion: 需改进标签实践、深入评估框架，并认识属性的社会复杂性以更准确评估偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在跨文化背景下的公平性问题，现有方法因性能损失或偏见问题进展缓慢。

Method: 引入CAIRe框架，基于知识库和事实信息对文化标签进行独立评分，并使用语言模型构建数据集验证。

Result: CAIRe在文化稀有项目数据集上F1分数提升28%，在文化通用概念数据集上与人类评分相关性达0.56和0.66。

Conclusion: CAIRe能有效评估文化相关性，与人类判断高度一致，为跨文化公平性提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的正则化技术CREPA，用于改进视频扩散模型（VDMs）的微调，通过跨帧对齐隐藏状态提升视觉保真度和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户级微调VDMs以生成反映特定训练数据属性的视频具有挑战性且研究不足，而现有方法如REPA在图像扩散模型中表现良好，但在VDMs中语义一致性不足。

Method: 提出CREPA技术，通过将帧的隐藏状态与相邻帧的外部特征对齐，优化VDMs的微调效果。

Result: 在大规模VDMs（如CogVideoX-5B和Hunyuan Video）上验证，CREPA显著提升了视觉保真度和跨帧语义一致性。

Conclusion: CREPA是一种广泛适用的技术，适用于多种数据集和参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

TL;DR: PatchGuard是一种基于Vision Transformer的对抗性鲁棒异常检测与定位方法，通过引入伪异常样本和定位掩码，显著提升了对抗攻击下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前异常检测与定位方法因训练数据仅包含正常样本而易受对抗攻击，PatchGuard旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 利用前景感知伪异常样本，结合ViT架构和对抗训练，通过新型损失函数增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在工业和医学数据集上，PatchGuard在对抗性环境下AD性能提升53.2%，AL提升68.5%，且在非对抗性环境下仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: PatchGuard通过伪异常样本和理论指导的对抗训练，显著提升了异常检测与定位的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

TL;DR: UFM模型通过统一训练在光流和宽基线匹配任务中表现优于专用方法，准确率提升28%，误差减少62%，速度提升6.7倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光流估计和宽基线匹配任务分离的问题，探索统一训练是否能超越专用方法。

Method: 使用简单的通用Transformer架构，直接回归(u,v)流，避免传统的粗到细成本体积方法。

Result: UFM在光流任务中比Unimatch准确率高28%，在宽基线匹配中比RoMa误差少62%，速度快6.7倍。

Conclusion: 统一训练在光流和宽基线匹配中均优于专用方法，为多模态、长距离和实时任务开辟新方向。

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

Conclusion: 量化YOLOv4-Tiny模型适合在低功耗设备上实时应急检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and
HR-Pairs dataset can be found in https://github.com/CVEO/MSSDF.

Conclusion: CheckManual填补了手册操作研究的空白，ManualPlan为后续工作设定了基线。

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Conclusion: AAPT方法在实时视频生成中表现出色，同时通过对抗训练减少了长视频生成中的误差累积。

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中取得了显著进展，但预训练中不可避免包含敏感信息，导致安全风险。现有方法将不安全概念视为固定词，限制了泛化擦除能力。

Method: SAGE通过语义增强擦除将概念词擦除转化为概念域擦除，并采用全局-局部协作保留机制，平衡擦除与保留。

Result: 实验表明，SAGE在安全生成方面优于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAGE为扩散模型的安全生成提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding
and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images. Code and Models

Conclusion: UniForward为3D场景与语义场的统一重建提供了高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法和数据集局限于有限模态，无法满足多模态查询的需求。

Method: 构建ORBench数据集（5种模态），提出ReID5o框架，支持多模态融合与对齐。

Result: ReID5o在ORBench上表现最佳，验证了数据集和方法的先进性。

Conclusion: ORBench和ReID5o为多模态ReID研究提供了理想平台和解决方案。

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet
this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called
Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整先验几何的方法，通过实时更新协方差矩阵来纠正不良分布样本的影响，显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子空间的方法因静态提取信息几何而无法处理不良分布样本导致的几何失真，需动态调整先验几何以应对新数据。

Method: 动态更新先验协方差矩阵，沿实时输入特征方向减少协方差，并在残差空间中约束调整，保留关键数据特征。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet-1k数据集上，包括自监督DINO模型，实验表明该方法显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整先验几何能有效纠正不良分布样本的影响，提升OOD检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）的SRPL-SFDA方法，用于无源域自适应（SFDA），通过增强伪标签质量和可靠性提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无源域自适应（SFDA）中目标域无标签图像监督不足的问题，同时兼顾隐私和访问限制。

Method: 1）T3IE增强伪标签质量；2）基于CMSO的可靠伪标签选择；3）可靠性感知训练。

Result: 在两个医学图像数据集上表现优于现有SFDA方法，接近目标域监督训练性能。

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA有效提升伪标签质量，显著改进SFDA性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

Motivation: 合成数据在人类动作视频理解任务中常因不自然特征而效果不佳，限制了其在手语翻译、手势识别等任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用可控3D高斯虚拟人模型进行姿态迁移，生成合成人类动作视频数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量合成数据，弥补真实数据中的不足，并开源了相关数据集和方法。

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何将预训练扩散模型高效蒸馏为生成去噪器，同时保留其快速生成和迭代优化的优势。

Method: 通过将无条件评分函数的隐含表征整合到VSD框架中，实现生成去噪器的可扩展学习，支持多噪声水平下的去噪后验分布采样。

Conclusion: NCVSD通过高效蒸馏和灵活采样，实现了快速生成与高质量结果的平衡，为生成模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

Motivation: 现有3D占用预测方法计算成本高，BEV和稀疏点表示各有优缺点，需要一种结合两者的方法。

Method: 采用双分支设计：基于查询的稀疏点分支和BEV分支，通过交叉注意力共享信息，最终融合输出。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes和Occ3D-Waymo基准测试中表现优越，推理速度与最新高效方法相当。

Conclusion: ODG结合BEV和稀疏点表示的优势，显著提升了3D占用预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Conclusion: InterSyn和SynJudge为下一代多模态系统的训练和评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: 轻量级架构和边缘感知策略有效提升了遥感图像描述的性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Conclusion: HAM有效整合多源信息，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在三个跨场景高光谱分类任务中表现优异，无需目标域数据即可达到先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架为开放集域泛化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

Result: 在V2V4Real数据集上显著优于基线框架（如DMSTrack和V2V4Real）。

Conclusion: 多智能体协同方法有效提升了3D LiDAR场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）方法存储成本高，且传统压缩方法不适用。

Conclusion: TinySplat为3D场景重建提供了一种高效且紧凑的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

TL;DR: TransDiff结合自回归Transformer与扩散模型，显著提升图像生成性能，并引入多参考自回归（MRAR）进一步优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归Transformer和扩散模型的优势，以提升图像生成的质量和效率。

Method: TransDiff通过联合建模框架编码标签和图像为高级语义特征，并利用扩散模型估计图像样本分布。MRAR通过多参考生成提升多样性。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，FID为1.61（MRAR优化后降至1.42），IS为293.4，推理速度显著快于现有方法。

Conclusion: TransDiff为图像生成领域开辟了新方向，结合MRAR进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

Motivation: 现有方法在熵参数估计中未充分利用信息，且使用固定似然区间限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入广义高斯熵模型控制尾部形状，并提出MED动态调整似然区间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了三种VAE模型的率失真性能，并可应用于其他压缩任务。

Conclusion: 广义高斯熵模型和MED方法有效提升了压缩性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

Motivation: 动态3D场景重建是3D视觉中的基础挑战，现有方法在静态场景中表现良好，但动态场景中存在冗余更新、运动监督不足和非刚性变形建模弱的问题。

Method: HAIF-GS采用稀疏锚点驱动变形，通过锚点过滤器识别运动区域，自监督流引导变形模块诱导锚点运动，并使用分层锚点传播机制处理细粒度变形。

Result: 实验表明，HAIF-GS在渲染质量、时间一致性和重建效率上显著优于现有动态3DGS方法。

Conclusion: HAIF-GS通过结构化动态建模，有效解决了动态3D场景重建中的关键问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LVLM解码策略未能有效利用视觉信息，导致视觉无关的响应。现有方法通常需要额外训练或多步推理。

Method: ReVisiT将视觉标记投影到文本标记分布空间，通过约束发散最小化动态选择最相关的视觉标记，并用于优化输出分布。

Result: 在三个LVLM幻觉基准测试中，ReVisiT显著提升了视觉相关性，计算开销低，且性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReVisiT是一种简单高效的方法，显著提升了LVLM的视觉信息利用能力，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

Result: 实验表明，仅需10%高斯基元即可保持渲染质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS），优于现有压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且通用，适用于任何3DGS流程，为轻量级神经渲染提供了新途径。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

Conclusion: 本研究深化了对物理角度鲁棒补丁的理解，揭示了文本概念与T2I生成内容物理属性之间的关系。

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet通过几何感知表示显著提升了3D物体检测性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19

Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically
reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat通过联合建模几何、外观和语义，实现了更全面的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单人固定动作序列，忽视了多人场景的需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为多人动作分割提供了新思路，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse
evaluation settings. The code is available at

Motivation: 铰接物体在现实世界中普遍存在，但现有方法在缺乏人工标注时难以构建统一的多部件运动表示。

Method: DeGSS将每个交互状态建模为共享场的平滑变形，通过变形轨迹指导渐进式部件分割，实现无监督的部件识别。

Result: 实验表明，DeGSS在准确性和稳定性上优于现有方法，并发布了新数据集RS-Art。

Conclusion: DeGSS提供了一种连续、解耦的部件级表示，支持精确的运动建模和重建。

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

Motivation: 研究胎儿和新生儿大脑快速发育阶段需要高分辨率图谱，但传统方法依赖大数据，难以应对病理数据稀缺的情况。

Method: CINeMA在潜在空间中操作，避免计算密集的图像配准，支持基于解剖特征的灵活条件设置。

Result: CINeMA在准确性、效率和多功能性上超越现有方法，支持组织分割、年龄预测及合成数据生成。

Conclusion: CINeMA为脑研究提供了强大工具，适用于低数据环境，并开源了代码和图谱。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Method: 系统评估了三种最先进的推理模型（OpenAI的o4-mini、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Gemini-2.5-Flash），并设计了GaslightingBench-R基准。

Result: 模型在误导性提示下准确性平均下降25-29%，在GaslightingBench-R上下降超过53%。

Conclusion: 推理模型在信念持久性方面存在根本性局限，揭示了逐步推理与信念保持之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step
reasoning and belief persistence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在推理阶段改进双编码器视觉语言模型（VLM）组合性的方法，通过分割图像和文本并匹配片段，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双编码器VLM（如CLIP）在组合性任务上表现不佳，而训练方法改进已有很多研究，推理阶段技术却较少被关注。

Method: 在推理时，将图像分割为小块，提取文本片段（对象、属性和关系），用VLM匹配图像块与文本片段，最后聚合相似度得分。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了VLM的组合性性能，尤其在属性-对象绑定任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 推理阶段技术潜力巨大，无需训练即可提升性能，未来可进一步优化图像处理和匹配策略。

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

Result: 实验表明FasterSNN在效率和稳定性上显著提升，保持诊断准确性。

Conclusion: FasterSNN为AD筛查提供了一种实用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集多关注家庭环境，缺乏真实工业场景的数据，CHIP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CHIP包含7种椅子，使用三种RGBD技术采集，提供77,811张带标注的图像，标注基于机器人运动学自动生成。

Result: 在三种零样本6D姿态估计方法上的测试表明，现有方法在CHIP数据集上仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: CHIP为工业场景中的6D姿态估计提供了新基准，并揭示了该领域的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Conclusion: LADH数据集和RGB-IR结合方法为长期非接触生理监测提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Conclusion: MPFNet显著提升了微表情识别的准确性，并展示了多先验知识融合的有效性。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

Result: 实验显示该方法在数学推理任务中表现一致提升，性能接近算法改进的效果，并在开源7B RL调优模型中达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 视觉扰动在多模态数学推理中至关重要，更好的推理始于更好的视觉处理。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign是一种无需训练、通用的方法，能有效校准扩散模型中的像素-文本对齐。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多模态数据的类别分布不一致，导致模型难以有效利用跨模态信息识别所有类别。

Method: 提出CSCF模型：1）将模态特征对齐到共享语义空间；2）通过不确定性估计选择最具判别性的模态；3）基于类别相似性融合跨模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，CSCF在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSCF有效解决了MMHCL任务，提升了多模态数据中类别识别的性能。

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨源差异和时间变化带来的定位难题，为无人机在GNSS不可用环境中的绝对定位提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

TL;DR: Q-SAM2提出了一种低比特量化方法，用于高效运行SAM2，解决了计算和内存消耗问题，并通过校准和量化感知训练提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2的计算和内存消耗高，限制了其在资源受限场景中的应用，因此需要一种高效的量化方法。

Method: Q-SAM2引入线性层校准方法和量化感知训练（QAT）管道，优化权重分布并适应量化阈值。

Result: Q-SAM2在高效推理中表现优异，尤其在2比特量化下超越现有方法，校准技术还能提升后训练量化的准确性。

Conclusion: Q-SAM2是一种高效且准确的量化方法，适用于资源受限场景，并显著提升了SAM2的性能。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大量计算资源进行任务特定训练的问题，探索是否可以通过预训练模型实现高效准确的6D姿态估计。

Method: 采用稀疏特征提取策略、特征感知评分机制和模块化设计，支持实例分割模型集成。

Result: 在BOP Benchmark的七个核心数据集上达到新SOTA，速度提升8倍，准确性提高5%，集成模型后准确性再提升8%。

Conclusion: FreeZeV2证明了无需任务特定训练即可实现高效准确的6D姿态估计，并在BOP Challenge 2024中获最佳方法奖。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

Result: DreamCS在实验中表现优于现有方法，生成的3D资产更符合几何真实性和人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习3D偏好数据，显著提升了文本到3D生成的质量和人类对齐性。

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward
models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to
their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,
the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D
meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ME研究仅依赖单一视觉模态，忽略了其他生理模态的丰富情感信息，导致性能不足。探索ME视觉特征与生理信号的跨模态关联机制，开发多模态融合框架，是推动ME分析的关键。

Method: 研究构建了MMME数据集，包含634个ME、2841个宏表情（MaEs）和2890个同步多模态PS试验，为ME神经机制研究和多模态融合分析提供了基础。

Result: 实验验证了数据集的可靠性，并证明ME与PS的整合显著提升了识别和检测性能。MMME是目前模态多样性最全面的ME数据集。

Conclusion: MMME为探索ME神经机制和视觉-生理协同效应提供了关键数据支持，推动了ME研究从单模态视觉分析向多模态融合的范式转变。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset
will be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.

Result: 在多个数据集上，DynaSplat在准确性和真实感上超越现有方法，且更高效紧凑。

Conclusion: DynaSplat为动态场景重建提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 现有导航研究分散于不同任务/能力（如ObjNav、ImgNav和VLN），缺乏通用性。论文旨在开发能够处理多模态和多能力自由指令的通用导航代理。

Method: 提出OctoNav-Bench基准，包含连续环境和多样化指令-轨迹对，并构建TBA-CoT数据集。OctoNav-R1基于MLLMs，采用三阶段混合训练范式（HTP）：Action-/TBA-SFT、Nav-GPRO和Online RL。

Result: OctoNav-R1在性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文通过TBA-SFT和Nav-GPRO提升了模型的推理能力，为通用导航代理的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写文本识别因字符集的演化和上下文依赖性而具有挑战性，现有模型在特定子集上表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新损失函数，利用预测文本与目标字符频率分布之间的Wasserstein距离，并通过引导解码方案提升现有模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个数据集和架构上提升了泛化能力和性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了手写文本识别中的分布偏移问题，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

Result: 现有模型在复杂场景中表现接近随机水平（50%），远低于人类近完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前模型在直观物理理解方面存在显著不足，需改进模型架构和训练方法。

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures
and training methodologies.

Motivation: 开放词汇表语义分割（OVSS）和域广义语义分割（DGSS）存在互补性，但尚未被统一。OV-DGSS旨在解决真实场景中（如自动驾驶）在未见类别和域中的鲁棒性问题。

Method: Vireo框架基于冻结的视觉基础模型（VFMs），通过深度VFMs引入场景几何特征，提出GeoText Prompts、CMPE和DOV-VEH三个关键组件，融合结构和语义特征。

Result: Vireo在域广义和开放词汇表识别任务中均取得最先进性能，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Vireo为多样化和动态环境中的鲁棒视觉理解提供了统一且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间结构理解上存在局限，需要一种高效方法提升其几何感知能力。

Method: 通过从现成的3D基础模型（如MASt3R、VGGT）中提取稀疏对应、相对深度关系和密集成本体积，注入预训练VLM中，不改变其架构。

Result: 在3D视觉语言推理和3D感知基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: Geometric Distillation为2D训练的VLM提供了一种可扩展且高效的3D理解路径，适用于空间多模态任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成逼真且3D一致的新视角，性能与依赖姿态输入的方法相当。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的范式在减少3D依赖方面具有可行性和有效性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

Motivation: 探索胶囊网络在姿态感知自我监督学习中的潜力，避免依赖专用预测器。

Method: 利用胶囊网络的固有姿态感知能力，设计EquiCaps方法，并通过多几何变换任务验证其性能。

Result: 在3DIEBench-T数据集上，EquiCaps在旋转预测任务中优于现有方法，R²达0.78。

Conclusion: EquiCaps展示了胶囊网络在姿态感知任务中的优势，为无预测器的等变方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$
of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE
and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to
non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule
architectures.

representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

*Tilemachos Aravanis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Petros Maragos,George Retsinas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Only-Style方法，通过自适应调整风格对齐参数，有效减少内容泄漏，同时保持风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以分离语义内容和风格元素，导致内容泄漏问题。

Method: Only-Style通过定位内容泄漏并自适应调整风格对齐参数，实现风格一致性与泄漏消除的平衡。

Result: 方法在多样实例中显著优于现有技术，实现无内容泄漏的风格一致性。

Conclusion: Only-Style提供了一种有效解决内容泄漏问题的方法，并提出了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

TL;DR: MetricHMR是一种从单目图像中恢复具有准确全局平移的度量尺度人体网格的方法，解决了现有HMR方法中的尺度和深度模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HMR方法存在严重的尺度和深度模糊，导致重建结果缺乏几何合理性。MetricHMR旨在解决这一问题，实现度量尺度的准确重建。

Method: 通过系统分析现有HMR方法的相机模型，强调标准透视投影模型的关键作用，并提出一种基于射线图的新方法，联合编码边界框信息、相机参数和几何线索，实现端到端的度量HMR。

Result: 实验表明，MetricHMR在度量姿态、形状和全局平移估计方面达到最先进性能，优于现有HMR方法。

Conclusion: MetricHMR通过标准透视投影模型和射线图方法，有效解决了HMR中的尺度和深度模糊问题，实现了高质量的度量尺度重建。

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对高光谱图像聚类的结构-光谱图卷积算子和证据引导的自适应边学习模块，显著提升了聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络未能充分利用高光谱图像的光谱信息，且超像素拓扑图不准确可能导致类语义混淆。

Method: 结合结构-光谱图卷积算子（SSGCO）和证据引导的自适应边学习（EGAEL）模块，嵌入对比学习框架中。

Result: 在四个数据集上，聚类精度分别提升了2.61%、6.06%、4.96%和3.15%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化表示学习和聚类，显著提升了高光谱图像的聚类性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视频的视觉问答任务扩展，要求模型结合外部知识和视觉信息进行对话。作者发布了一个包含2,017个视频和5,986个对话的数据集，并提供了基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在视觉对话任务中结合外部知识的挑战，尤其是在视频背景下，模型需同时处理视觉信息和对话上下文。

Method: 构建了一个包含视频和对话的数据集（OKCV），要求模型识别相关视频片段并利用外部知识回答问题。

Result: 提供了基线模型在数据集上的表现，展示了任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: 该任务为视觉对话和外部知识结合的研究提供了新方向，数据集公开可用。

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但其高内存和计算需求限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。后训练量化（PTQ）是一种解决方案，但标准PTQ方法难以处理异常值，且需要更高压缩率。

Method: 提出HadaNorm方法，通过归一化激活特征通道并应用Hadamard变换，减少异常值，实现更高效的量化。

Result: HadaNorm在Transformer块各组件中一致减少量化误差，在效率与性能的权衡上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HadaNorm为扩散模型的量化提供了一种高效解决方案，显著提升了量化效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LEO-VL是一种基于高效场景表示（CFG）的3D-VL模型，通过大规模训练和多样化任务数据，在多个3D QA基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够理解3D场景并执行自然语言指令的通用3D-VL模型是长期目标，但现有模型在能力和鲁棒性上仍落后于2D模型，主要障碍是数据可扩展性和高效场景表示的缺乏。

Method: 提出LEO-VL模型，采用CFG（压缩特征网格）作为高效场景表示，减少计算开销，并利用超过700k高质量3D-VL数据进行训练。

Result: LEO-VL在SQA3D、MSQA和Beacon3D等3D QA基准测试中达到最佳性能，并通过消融实验验证了CFG的高效性和数据多样性对模型的重要性。

Conclusion: LEO-VL及其CFG表示和SceneDPO后训练目标为开发可扩展且鲁棒的3D-VL通用模型提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有VQA数据集在真实场景中因果推理问题上的空白，挑战模型对动作和事件结果的预测能力。

Method: 设计了五种问题类型（反事实、假设、预期、规划和描述性），并引入质量控制机制防止模型利用语言线索。

Result: 当前前沿多模态模型在基准测试中表现远低于人类，尤其在预期和假设问题上。

Conclusion: CausalVQA揭示了当前系统在时空推理、物理原理理解和替代方案预测方面的不足。

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,

developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data

Conclusion: 通过视觉绘图操作，VILASR有效解决了空间推理任务中的局限性，为多模态推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义引导和区域化策略，显著提升了绘画生成的艺术性和质量。

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

Result: 在AOL和Tiangong-ST数据集上验证了SGR的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs的融合提供了新方法。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

Conclusion: ReSim通过多样化数据和高可控性设计，显著提升了驾驶场景模拟的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

TL;DR: AnimateAnyMesh是一个基于文本驱动的高效3D网格动画生成框架，通过DyMeshVAE架构和Rectified Flow训练策略，实现了高质量的动态网格生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D内容生成面临建模时空分布复杂和训练数据稀缺的挑战，需要一种高效且高质量的方法。

Method: 采用DyMeshVAE架构分离时空特征，结合Rectified Flow训练策略，并引入DyMesh数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能快速生成语义准确且时间连贯的动画，质量和效率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnimateAnyMesh显著推动了4D内容生成的实用化，相关数据和模型将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过区域特定的条件绑定实现多概念人类动画的精确控制，解决了现有方法在多人/物交互场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能全局控制单一人体动画，无法精确处理多人/物交互场景，限制了应用。

Method: 利用掩码预测器自动推断布局信息，并通过迭代方式将局部音频条件注入对应区域，实现多模态条件的精确匹配。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在多模态条件下具有显式布局控制的优势，生成高质量多概念人类中心视频。

Conclusion: 通过区域特定条件绑定，显著提升了多概念动画的精确控制能力，为复杂交互场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准因依赖表面线索导致评分虚高，需更准确评估模型性能。

Method: 引入MVP基准，包含55K高质量多选题视频QA样本，每样本有最小变化对，要求模型同时答对。

Result: 人类表现92.9%，最佳开源模型40.2%，随机表现25%。

Conclusion: MVP基准有效避免模型依赖捷径，更准确评估物理理解能力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Result: 现有模型在评估编辑时表现不佳，常出现幻觉描述。提出的新方法在伪影检测和差异描述生成上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: EditInspector为文本引导编辑提供了评估标准，新方法在关键任务上表现更优。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Result: 生成的音频能准确传达材质和动作信息，人类观察者难以区分真假。

Conclusion: 模型成功实现了3D手部动作到声音的映射，为交互场景提供新可能。

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的图像修复方法在自然图像修复中表现良好，但在文本区域重建时容易产生错误的文本模式（文本图像幻觉）。

Method: 提出了TAIR任务，并开发了SA-Text基准和TeReDiff框架，结合扩散模型和文本检测模块进行联合训练。

Result: 实验表明，TeReDiff在文本识别准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TAIR任务和TeReDiff框架为图像修复中的文本保真度提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Conclusion: PlayerOne是自我中心真实世界模拟的首个尝试，为世界建模及其应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation
and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world
modeling and its diverse applications.

TL;DR: AIM是一种自适应干预机制，通过代理Q函数减少人类监督的认知负担，显著降低专家监控成本，并提高学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式模仿学习（IIL）方法对人类的认知要求较高，需要一种更高效的自适应干预机制。

Method: 提出AIM算法，利用代理Q函数动态调整干预请求，根据代理与专家行为的对齐程度决定是否需要人类演示。

Result: 实验显示AIM在连续和离散控制任务中显著减少专家监控成本，比基线方法Thrifty-DAgger效率提升40%。

Conclusion: AIM能有效识别安全关键状态，收集高质量专家演示，减少数据需求和环境交互。

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired
behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high
cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention
Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive
criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function
to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on
the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when
the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent
becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the
real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our
expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert
monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to
the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%
improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert
assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and
reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo
video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

Result: 在控制实验设计问题后，模型在之前被报告为完全失败的Tower of Hanoi实例上表现高准确性。

Conclusion: 实验设计对评估AI推理能力至关重要，需避免误导性结论。

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit
"accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds.
We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design
limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals
three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed
model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly
acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated
evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and
practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3)
Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically
impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models
are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we
control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions
instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple
models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported
as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful
experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Ming-Omni为多模态研究提供了开源解决方案，支持进一步开发。

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在战略决策中是否表现出类似人类的有限理性行为。

Method: 通过行为博弈论实验范式（如石头剪刀布和囚徒困境）比较LLMs和人类的行为。

Result: LLMs表现出人类启发式行为但更僵化，对动态环境变化敏感度较低。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs仅部分模拟人类有限理性，需改进训练方法以增强灵活性和情境感知。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making
settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full
rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental
paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on
two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's
Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational
play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,
we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality
characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human
heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation
when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly
and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game
environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures
in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find
effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that
current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and
highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent
modeling and stronger context awareness.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

Method: Fast-MCTD结合了并行MCTD（延迟树更新和冗余感知选择）和稀疏MCTD（轨迹粗化）两种技术。

Result: 实验显示Fast-MCTD比标准MCTD快100倍，性能相当或更好，甚至在某些任务中比Diffuser更快。

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD为基于扩散的推理时间规划提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Conclusion: 微调LLMs在复杂多人游戏中具有潜力，为战略决策提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and
competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods
rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which
demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong
performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to
Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action
combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address
this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns
equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive
factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action
assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium
policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model
using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,
surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making
and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to
increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant
attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an
agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal
norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific
application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large
models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value
principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment
evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a
top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system
application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific
viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets
for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods.
Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within
agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in
this field.

*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Intent Factored Generation (IFG)方法，通过两阶段采样提高LLM生成样本的多样性，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多样性生成上的不足，如仅通过词汇改写导致重复响应，影响推理任务和对话体验。

Method: IFG分为两阶段：首先生成语义密集的意图（如摘要或关键词），再基于原始提示和意图生成最终响应。高温度用于意图阶段以增加多样性，低温度用于最终生成以确保一致性。

Result: 在数学、代码任务中提升pass@k和强化学习效果，指令调优中结合Direct Preference Optimisation提高对话多样性且不牺牲奖励，通用语言建模任务中保持质量的同时提高多样性。

Conclusion: IFG是一种简单有效的方法，通过调整提示和温度设置，可轻松集成到多种算法中，适用于广泛任务。

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

*Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou,Antonio Rago,Maria Vanina Martinez,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类倾向于基于解释的信念修订，而非经典理论中的最小修订，这对AI系统设计有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类如何根据新信息修订信念，以开发能更好模拟人类推理的AI系统。

Method: 通过三项用户研究，系统调查人类在解释引导下修订信念的行为。

Result: 人类偏好基于解释的信念修订，且这种修订方式不一定是经典理论中的最小修订。

Conclusion: AI系统应纳入基于解释的信念修订操作，以更好地与人类认知过程对齐。

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

Motivation: 现代AI的主要挑战是通过观察学习理解世界和行动。

Method: 使用互联网视频数据预训练V-JEPA 2，结合语言模型和机器人视频数据微调V-JEPA 2-AC。

Result: V-JEPA 2在动作理解和预测任务中表现优异，V-JEPA 2-AC在机器人规划任务中实现零样本部署。

Conclusion: 自监督学习结合少量交互数据可构建物理世界规划模型。

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种元学习方法，通过蒸馏任务相关图像特征生成软提示，提升小规模LMM在少样本任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模LMM在ICL中表现不一致的问题，避免图像嵌入中的冗余信息干扰。

Method: 引入注意力映射模块和软提示蒸馏，结合LLaVA v1.5架构，实现少样本任务适应。

Result: 在VL-ICL Bench上表现优于ICL和提示调优方法，尤其在图像扰动下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LMM在少样本任务中的适应性和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Llama 3的抗体-抗原结合亲和力预测模型（LlamaAffinity），在多个评估指标上优于现有方法，并显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抗体亲和力测量方法耗时且昂贵，AI技术的发展为抗体设计和亲和力预测提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源Llama 3框架和OAS数据库的抗体序列数据，开发了LlamaAffinity模型。

Result: 模型在准确性（0.9640）、F1分数（0.9643）、精确度（0.9702）、召回率（0.9586）和AUC-ROC（0.9936）上表现优异，且训练时间显著缩短。

Conclusion: LlamaAffinity模型在抗体-抗原亲和力预测中表现出色，为AI驱动的抗体设计提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

TL;DR: FinHEAR是一个多智能体框架，结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知推理，提升语言模型在金融决策中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在金融决策中缺乏对人类行为模式（如信息不对称下的专家依赖、损失厌恶和时间调整）的捕捉能力。

Method: FinHEAR通过多智能体协作，分析历史趋势、解释当前事件并检索专家先例，结合行为经济学设计专家引导检索、信心调整头寸和结果优化。

Result: 在金融数据集上，FinHEAR在趋势预测和交易任务中表现优于基线，准确率和风险调整收益更高。

Conclusion: FinHEAR通过结合人类专业知识和自适应风险感知，显著提升了语言模型在金融决策中的表现。

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

*Xinyuan Wang,Liang Wu,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageLLM提出了一种基于用户反馈的奖励机制，用于优化预训练大语言模型在整页优化（WPO）任务中的微调，通过结合页面级和项目级奖励，显著提升了推荐系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型（LLMs）在WPO任务中的微调需要大量人工标注数据，成本高昂且难以扩展。用户反馈虽然噪声较多，但可以作为替代监督信号。

Method: 提出PageLLM，采用混合粒度的奖励机制（页面级和项目级奖励）来微调LLMs，优化整体页面质量和关键推荐项的准确性。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上验证了PageLLM的有效性，在线A/B测试中实现了0.44%的GMV增长。

Conclusion: PageLLM通过用户反馈驱动的奖励机制，成功解决了WPO任务中LLMs微调的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法（传统ML低效，LLMs不稳定）无法同时解决特征转换中的稳定性和有效性问题，需结合两者优势。

Method: 1. 生成高质量样本；2. 潜在空间搜索嵌入；3. 学生LLM知识蒸馏；4. LLM-ML联合解码。

Result: 下游性能提升5%，错误率降低近半，团队策略高效且鲁棒。

Conclusion: 团队框架有效结合LLMs和ML，提升特征转换性能，同时发现LLMs对原始数据的理解能力。

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

Motivation: 传统决策模型（如DDM和Poisson计数器模型）缺乏学习机制，且仅适用于参与者已具备类别知识的任务。本文旨在通过生物可解释的SNN模型，结合学习机制，填补认知模型与生物模型之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出了一种基于Hawkes过程的SNN模型，展示了DDM与Poisson计数器模型的耦合关系，并推导了具有相关噪声的DDM如何从受局部学习规则支配的Hawkes网络中产生。

Result: 模型在在线分类任务中验证了预测效果，表明DDM可以通过脉冲Poisson神经元近似，且Hawkes网络能够生成特定DDM。

Conclusion: 该研究为将生物相关神经机制整合到认知模型中提供了重要进展，深化了对神经活动与行为关系的理解。

Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence.
In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of
evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson
processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used
to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism
and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the
categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we
propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for
decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons
activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a
coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing
that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and
that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we
show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes
network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we
designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This
work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant
neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of
the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

Conclusion: 增强的AdaBoost框架在多种FL场景中表现出更高的效率和鲁棒性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous
AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application
across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based
model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection,
and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates
adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce
synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or
improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve
communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each
domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead,
convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data
and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical
results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and
communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with
convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts
summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the
adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are
provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency
and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of
the approach.

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the
coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for
the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes
important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the
Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the
coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve
the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of
Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to
the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling
for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is
derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The
novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its
associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is
the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring
that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2
or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the
CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

Conclusion: LLMs结合性能强化技术可自动化GPU编程，适用于硬件特定和高性能需求场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Conclusion: LwPTV方法灵活且高效，可无缝集成现有模型合并方法，提升多任务学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

Method: 利用生成概率建立响应轨迹内奖励一致性，提出轨迹内一致性正则化，增强相邻过程的奖励一致性。

Result: 改进的奖励模型在RewardBench上表现更优，同时提升了DPO对齐策略和BON推理验证结果。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度的奖励一致性信号，显著提升了奖励模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

*Joshua Barron,Devin White*

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型中记忆与泛化的关系，发现两者之间存在权衡：小模型泛化能力强但记忆差，大模型反之。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索记忆与泛化在LLMs中的关系，为模型设计提供理论依据。

Method: 预训练容量受限的Transformer模型，使用合成字符级任务分别测试泛化和记忆能力。

Result: 小模型泛化好但记忆差，大模型反之；联合训练时无模型能泛化。

Conclusion: 预训练可能偏向某种学习模式，模型容量影响学习行为，对小模型设计有启示。

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、金融等领域，数据源的特征偏移可能导致下游分析错误，现有方法难以高效定位这些偏移。

Method: 提出FSL-Net，通过训练学习数据集的统计特性，无需重新训练即可定位新数据集中的特征偏移。

Result: FSL-Net能够高效且准确地定位特征偏移，适用于大规模高维数据。

Conclusion: FSL-Net为解决特征偏移定位问题提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The
code and ready-to-use trained model are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的威胁模型，用于系统比较LLM越狱攻击方法，发现离散优化攻击优于基于LLM的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击方法在流畅性和计算成本上差异大，缺乏统一评估标准。

Method: 构建基于N-gram语言模型的威胁模型，评估攻击方法的分布可能性。

Result: 攻击成功率低于预期，离散优化攻击表现更优。

Conclusion: 有效攻击利用罕见bigrams，威胁模型为攻击分析提供了可解释性。

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UPQ的统一渐进量化框架，用于将指令调优的LLM从FP16逐步量化为INT2，结合块级后训练量化和蒸馏量化感知训练，显著提升了2-bit量化模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优LLM在2-bit量化中的挑战，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 采用渐进量化框架（FP16→INT4→INT2），结合块级PTQ和蒸馏QAT，最小化JSD散度。

Result: 首次实现开源指令调优LLM的INT2量化，在MMLU和IFEval基准上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: UPQ为资源受限设备上的高效LLM部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

TL;DR: MetaTT是一个统一的Tensor Train适配器框架，用于预训练Transformer的全局低秩微调，相比LoRA显著减少参数数量，同时保持相似精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有微调方法（如LoRA）独立调整每个权重矩阵导致参数冗余的问题，提出共享TT分解的全局优化方案。

Method: 使用单一共享的Tensor Train分解所有Transformer子模块（如查询、键、值层），通过索引结构轴（如层和矩阵类型）实现参数压缩。

Result: 在标准语言建模基准测试中，MetaTT显著减少参数数量，同时保持与LoRA相似的精度，甚至优于其他基于张量的方法。

Conclusion: MetaTT通过成熟的优化方法（如DMRG风格的自适应最小化）简化训练，并能轻松扩展到多任务共享适配器。

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

Conclusion: SensorLM在可扩展性、标签效率和零样本泛化方面展现出潜力，适用于活动和医疗领域。

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG模型因通道配置、序列长度和任务目标的差异而泛化能力受限，现有基础模型在异质表示能力和多尺度依赖捕捉上效率低下。

Method: 提出TFDual-Tokenizer独立编码时频分量，扩展离散表示空间；设计EEGSSM结合全局卷积和滑动窗口注意力，捕捉多尺度依赖。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上验证了CodeBrain的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CodeBrain为EEG建模提供了生物启发和可解释的方法，为未来神经科学研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity
and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel
configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability
of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models
(EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited
heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale
brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an
efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two
stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes
heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion
of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of
interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the
EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a
sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local
dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects
the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent
multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning
objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive
experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of
CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and
interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future
neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in
the future version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态数据（如天气、医疗、能源）的普遍性需要有效的时间序列检索方法，现有方法缺乏语义基础且难以处理多模态对齐。

Method: 提出TRACE，通过文本上下文对齐时间序列嵌入，支持细粒度通道级对齐和硬负样本挖掘，实现跨模态检索。

Result: TRACE在下游预测和分类任务中达到最优性能，同时作为通用检索器增强时间序列模型。

Conclusion: TRACE是一种多功能工具，既能作为高效编码器，也能作为通用检索器，显著提升时间序列模型的性能。

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

Result: BSA-TNP在精度上优于或匹配最佳模型，训练时间大幅缩短，支持多分辨率学习和时空建模，单GPU可处理百万级数据。

Conclusion: BSA-TNP在精度和可扩展性上取得平衡，适用于多种复杂任务。

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to
directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes.
While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to
Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry
applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These
applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these
models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly
when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a
versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural
Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks),
group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention
(BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models
while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation
invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3)
transparently model processes that evolve in both space and time, (4) support
high dimensional fixed effects, and (5) scale gracefully -- running inference
with over 1M test points with 100K context points in under a minute on a single

Conclusion: 该框架通过事实抽象和LLM模拟的准确性提升代理的在线学习和决策能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Result: 在临床诊断模拟中，CuriosiTree能有效整合异构信息源，优于基线策略，实现准确诊断。

Conclusion: CuriosiTree为LLMs提供了一种成本效益高的信息获取策略，适用于信息不足的决策场景。

Abstract: Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident
decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to
acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by
consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly,
different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing
the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and
cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based,
test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models
(LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected
information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a
balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical
validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables
cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and
outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences
that enable accurate diagnosis.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the
challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial
correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly
repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g.,
Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time
series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone
with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic
backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition).
We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide
excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for
spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that
FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information
processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling,
while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior
gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or
sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark
datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation,
environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent
hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without
any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural
architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially
transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and
efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We
introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range
ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a
learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5
reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based
diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour
initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding
(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream
attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal
embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and
probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast
demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as
cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.
By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of
magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale
resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the
training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.

*Hariharan Ramesh,Jyotikrishna Dass*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLoRIST提出了一种联邦学习框架，通过高效分解本地适配器，平衡通信效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中LoRA方法的通信效率、模型准确性和计算成本问题。

Method: FLoRIST通过单独对本地适配器进行奇异值分解，构建全局低秩适配器。

Result: 在多种数据集和LLM上，FLoRIST在通信效率和性能上表现最佳。

Conclusion: FLoRIST在联邦学习中实现了高效的参数微调，适用于异构客户端。

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

methods, offering a simple and intuitive interface and a seamless conversion
from centralized to federated training tasks. FedRAG is also deeply integrated

*Hao Hu,Xinqi Wang,Simon Shaolei Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的任务：从离线强化学习数据集中聚类轨迹，每个聚类中心代表生成其轨迹的策略。通过KL散度和策略诱导分布的混合，提出了PG-Kmeans和CAAE两种方法，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中轨迹聚类的需求，通过聚类中心表示生成策略，为离线RL提供新的分析工具。

Method: 提出PG-Kmeans（基于行为克隆策略迭代分配轨迹）和CAAE（类似VQ-VAE框架，引导潜在表示靠近特定码本条目）。

Result: 在D4RL数据集和GridWorld环境中验证了方法的有效性，能够将轨迹划分为有意义的聚类。

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans和CAAE为基于策略的轨迹聚类提供了有前景的框架，适用于离线RL及其他领域。

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的降阶模型方法mLaSDI，通过多阶段训练自编码器来提升对复杂或高频数据的重建精度和动态预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LaSDI方法在复杂或高频数据下难以同时满足数据重建和动态预测的要求，因此需要改进。

Method: 采用多阶段自编码器训练（mLaSDI），每个阶段的自编码器学习修正前一阶段的误差，从而提升整体性能。

Result: mLaSDI在预测和重建误差上表现更优，同时减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: mLaSDI是一种高效且准确的降阶模型方法，适用于复杂或高频数据场景。

Abstract: Determining accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an important task in many scientific disciplines. However, solvers
can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order
models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was
proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the
training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This
allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional
ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous
problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing
training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,
particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose
multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several
autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns
to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with
small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while
also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.

TL;DR: 本文研究了用于总结Transformer嵌入模型输出的池化方法设计，提出了一种基于注意力的自适应池化方法，优于传统方法（如AvgPool、MaxPool、ClsToken）在信号噪声比波动时的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于强化学习和视觉应用中，输入向量中部分为信号（有用信息），其余为噪声（干扰信息），传统池化方法在信号噪声比波动时性能下降。

Method: 通过将池化问题建模为向量量化，提出了一种基于注意力的自适应池化方法，理论上能逼近信号最优的向量量化器。

Result: 在合成数据集和标准任务（关系推理、多智能体强化学习、视觉基准）上验证了该方法在噪声环境中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自适应池化方法在信号噪声比波动时表现更优，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

Motivation: 现有遗忘技术的分类往往忽视其根本意图（真实移除知识或仅抑制行为效果），本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出基于意图的新分类法，重新审视遗忘方法的有效性，评估现有评价策略，并指出实际挑战。

Result: 发现许多移除方法可能仅实现行为抑制，提出改进评价指标的建议，并强调实际部署中的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文为生成AI中的遗忘研究提供了全面框架，支持未来研究并指导数据移除与隐私的政策决策。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine
learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or
knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques
have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering
hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by
their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more
fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks
to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects.
In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented
perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First,
we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may
functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is
necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies,
identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions
for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we
highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential
unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods.
In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and
advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and
guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CM系统在故障严重性估计和维护决策上依赖人工专家，存在高误报率和不确定性，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出MindRAG框架，利用多模态RAG技术和定制化向量存储结构，结合现有标注和维护工单数据，训练推理代理。

Result: 初步实验表明，MindRAG能有效提供决策支持，提升CM系统的可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: MindRAG为工业CM提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，有望减少人工依赖并提升系统性能。

Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and
efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems
effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation,
and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The
analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems
typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading
to increased workload and reduced efficiency.
  This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with
CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false
alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and
offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework
combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector
store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages
existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a
supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training
predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.
  The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry
CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with
LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM
data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing
real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for
integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios.
Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst,
indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient
management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

Conclusion: CFMI是一种适用于多种数据类型和维度的填补方法，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new
general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous
normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with
intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine
classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to
moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms
both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying
the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches
the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in
terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as
traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to
high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep
learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range
of data types and dimensionalities.

Motivation: 传统基于时间差分误差的优先级方法容易受噪声干扰，类似于探索中的噪声电视问题。

Result: 在表格模型和Atari游戏中验证了方法的有效性，优于分位数回归深度Q学习基准。

Conclusion: 为强化学习中的不确定性优先级回放开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting
relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of
contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically,
transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However,
this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value
estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the
noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which
exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate
the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic
uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the
replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be
reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer
generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits
of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple
multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our
prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression
deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty
prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions
and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However,
existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical
data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies
and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that
automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design
with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop
to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships,
guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by
estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically,
G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with
respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct
parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior
distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and
stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence,
G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating
data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex
decision-making.

Result: 在多种环境中验证，包括确定性和随机动态、离散和连续状态空间，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAD框架能高效学习准确的状态表示，适用于多种任务，如目标导向强化学习和奖励塑造。

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural
language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health
record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the
southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the
UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma
keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for
additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics,
we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually
reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion
topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms
associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis
among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific
demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at
least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with
HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including
"Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited
Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so
on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences.
Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and
related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable,
time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional
questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅显著优于现有方法，且对不同程度的采样频率变化表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在长输入下的高计算和内存成本问题，同时避免线性注意力方法因过度关注近期标记而导致的准确性下降。

Conclusion: DSLA和Serve框架在效率和准确性之间取得了平衡，为长输入下的LLM应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via
self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.
While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,
they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,
we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel
design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving
historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the
short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance
efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce
\textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that
progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time,
guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained
fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains
consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality.
Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text
summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference
than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while
retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies
show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ErrorEraser的通用插件，用于解决持续学习中数据偏差导致的错误记忆问题，通过识别和擦除错误知识提升新旧任务性能。

Conclusion: ErrorEraser为持续学习中的偏差问题提供了一种有效解决方案，提升了模型的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available

Result: 本文量化了对抗分类风险的收敛速率，并提供了标准学习环境中的替代风险界限。

Conclusion: 研究填补了对抗训练中收敛速率分析的空白，为未来研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing
sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the
adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known
as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at
which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for
such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This
paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.
Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the
standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent
interest.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Motivation: 研究扩散蒸馏的性能下降问题，探索GAN目标的作用机制。

Result: 实验表明，仅需0.2M图像即可实现强性能，5M图像接近SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 扩散训练是一种强大的生成预训练过程，为高效一步生成模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost
of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student
performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN
objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:
mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student
model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct
imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,
without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is
sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.
Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a
form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be
unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a
one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of
parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and
near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain
analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in
diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion
training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process,
which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

Result: 在QH9和MD17数据集上表现优异，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SO(2)局部框架操作为可扩展且对称感知的电子结构学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate
electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship
between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local
frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves
global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor
products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful
SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates
and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of
SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed
within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the
symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and
MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a
wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong
generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames
offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of
electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合优化问题因离散结构和庞大解空间而难以求解。DRL学习效率高但探索能力有限，GA全局搜索能力强但计算效率低。EAM旨在结合两者优势。

Method: EAM框架通过DRL生成解，利用遗传操作（如交叉和变异）优化解，并将优化后的解重新注入DRL训练循环，提升探索能力和收敛速度。

Result: 在TSP、CVRP等基准问题上，EAM显著提升了求解质量和训练效率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAM是一种通用且即插即用的框架，有效结合了DRL和GA的优势，为组合优化问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their
discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly
from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and
susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such
as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but
are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,
we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and
plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the
global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned
policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as
crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected
into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating
convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an
upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and
the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL
solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on
benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM
significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over
competitive baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种因果感知的后训练方法（CAPT），通过分解有偏预测为两个无偏步骤，减少大语言模型（LLMs）的预训练偏见，提升其泛化能力。实验证明CAPT在小样本下优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在预训练中习得的虚假相关性导致其在分布外（OOD）样本上表现不佳，需要一种方法减少这种偏见。

Method: 提出CAPT方法，将预测分解为事件估计和事件干预两个无偏步骤，避免额外微调偏见。

Result: 在CLadder和PrOntoQA数据集上，3B规模的LLMs使用CAPT在少量样本下优于传统方法和更大模型。

Conclusion: CAPT有效减少预训练偏见，提升模型泛化能力，且样本效率高。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during
pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through
causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into
two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event
intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional
fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability.
Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical
reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with
CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution
(ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across
geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field
of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization
errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied,
their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the
generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data
and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world
applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained
generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient
decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild
assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or
rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed
light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic
gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on
the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that
Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the
generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the
data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical
experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效检测不活跃组，显著提升效率且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的筛选规则安全高效，可无缝集成现有优化算法，适用于高维场景。

Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse
learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for
the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block
non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid
or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant
computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios.
To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the
Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero
coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding
these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in
computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening
rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and
stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can
be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same
results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our
method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Stained Glass Transform能够在保护输入数据隐私的同时，保持LLM的实用性，为共享计算环境中的隐私问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

Result: 新方法在真实数据集上表现与Softmax Loss相当或更好，同时显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该框架为相似性学习提供了理论支持和高效工具，适用于需要平衡排名质量和计算效率的任务。

Abstract: Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity
learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled
through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal
structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely
adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global
negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application
scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from
significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to
large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss
formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the
Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the
Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through
Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic
mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and
uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based
loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the
highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing
both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while
significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity
learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools,
with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking
quality and computational efficiency is essential.

Abstract: We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL
divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects

as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations
are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly,
we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of
the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate
the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and
show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein

on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

*Thomas J. Ringstrom,Paul R. Schrater*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OKBEs引入状态-时间选项核（STOK）用于无奖励MDP，直接优化预测映射以最大化目标完成概率并避免约束违反。STOK具有组合性、模块化和可解释性，支持长期规划和内在动机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统强化学习中奖励最大化与组合性、模块化和可解释性之间的冲突，支持可验证的长期规划和动态高维世界模型。

Method: 通过Chapman-Kolmogorov方程组合STOK，高效表示和计算高维STOK，并分解为局部STOK和目标条件策略。

Result: 实现了高度灵活的智能体，能够快速合成元策略、跨任务重用规划表示，并通过内在动机函数验证目标。

Conclusion: OKBEs通过STOK的组合性和模块化特性，为高维动态世界模型中的长期规划和内在动机提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

Motivation: 在马尔可夫决策过程中，如何通过轨迹级偏好比较高效学习奖励函数是一个核心挑战，需要设计既能保证理论性能又能减少查询复杂度的算法。

Method: 提出基于随机探索的元算法，避免乐观方法的计算难题；进一步引入批量查询和最优实验设计以优化查询效率。

Result: 在温和的强化学习假设下，算法实现了遗憾和最终迭代保证；实验表明其与基于奖励的强化学习性能相当，且查询次数较少。

Conclusion: 该方法通过随机探索和批量查询设计，有效平衡了理论保证与查询效率，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov
decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference
comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在微分方程周期性解的学习、时间序列插值和预测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了周期性信号的泛化和外推能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Athena-PRM是一种多模态过程奖励模型，用于评估复杂推理问题中每一步的奖励分数。通过利用弱和强完成者之间预测一致性生成高质量标注数据，仅需5000样本即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动标注方法（如蒙特卡洛估计）产生噪声标签且计算成本高，需高效生成高质量过程标注数据。

Method: 提出利用弱和强完成者预测一致性作为可靠过程标签的标准，并采用ORM初始化和负数据上采样策略提升性能。

Result: 在多个场景和基准测试中表现优异，如Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型性能提升10.2点（WeMath）和7.1点（MathVista），并在VisualProcessBench中超越之前SoTA 3.9 F1分数。

Conclusion: Athena-PRM能高效评估推理步骤正确性，显著提升模型性能，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

TL;DR: STOAT是一种新型空间-时间概率因果推理网络框架，用于空间-时间因果时间序列的概率预测，通过结合空间关系矩阵和深度概率模型，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常独立建模空间和时间动态，并忽略因果驱动的概率预测，导致预测能力受限。

Method: STOAT扩展了因果推理方法，引入空间关系矩阵编码区域间依赖关系，并通过深度概率模型估计分布参数，支持多种输出分布。

Result: 在COVID-19数据上的实验表明，STOAT在关键指标上优于现有概率预测模型，尤其在空间依赖性强的区域表现突出。

Conclusion: STOAT为复杂空间-时间任务（如疫情管理）提供了一个通用框架，结合了因果推理和地理空间概率预测。

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal
observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across
geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and
temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic
forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT
(Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework
for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal
inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes
interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially
informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by
deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions,
enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output
distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture
region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries
demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting
models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics,
particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal
inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a
generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中样本效率低、探索不足及OOD动作限制的问题。

Result: 在28个任务上验证，性能优于现有离线与混合RL方法，计算开销低。

Conclusion: MOORL高效且实用，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL,
which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected
datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is
constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit
policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework
that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While
previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added
computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces
a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories.
This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while
utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by
effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added
complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL
benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational
overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for
practical applications in real-world scenarios.

Result: 基础模型在分布内预测中不自信，校准误差高；在分布偏移下校准更好。后处理技术对分布内有效，但对严重偏移不可靠。

Conclusion: 基础模型的校准行为复杂，挑战了持续改进的传统观点。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep
neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to
exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts.
Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated
significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration
properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing
insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows
that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions,
resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved
calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in
the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate
underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable
under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive
results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of
architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established
narratives of continuous improvement.

Abstract: Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of
tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore,
existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with
large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the
Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random
projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate
randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem.
Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are
established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework
tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm
is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale
tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified
nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for
several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized
situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for
large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated
into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate
the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 剪枝50%的SSM权重且无需微调，零精度损失，达到Mamba模型剪枝的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SparseSSM为状态空间模型提供了高效的剪枝解决方案，揭示了模型冗余分布。

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while
permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of
parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are
tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and
discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space
module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free
pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS)
framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an
approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace
information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity
analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on
where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to
semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM
weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving
the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of
equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized

equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and
reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes
into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras.
Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less
tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or
matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including
estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using
significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data
generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for
data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the
potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting
underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of
unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world
settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this
paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context
examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that
even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further
introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias
into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately
compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and
protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated
with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with
in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: FedVLMBench为隐私保护的多模态基础模型联邦训练提供了标准化平台和实证指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

Result: 实验表明，SyncFed在分布式测试环境中显著提升了模型准确性和信息新鲜度。

Conclusion: SyncFed通过时间同步机制有效解决了联邦学习中的时间不一致问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed
environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays,
clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of
factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model
reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation
and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms
to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional
deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a
time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping
to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is
quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of
client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our
empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under
\emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context,
resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to
round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.

Result: 实验表明，WAFFLE在检测准确性和下游分类性能上优于现有联邦学习异常检测算法。

Conclusion: WAFFLE作为一种训练前的替代方案，有效解决了联邦学习中异常客户端检测的挑战。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models
across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the
presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors
or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model
performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key
challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated
Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before
training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from
either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both
approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for
unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a
distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication
and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection,
WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to
local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated
scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves
detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to
existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a
pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

Abstract: The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven
advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While
graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade,
representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining
momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have
emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The
messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However,
most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart,
often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper
we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats
the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the
information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators
such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach
has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of
distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one
hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of
optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein
pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification
tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT是一种无需重新训练即可确保LLM输出满足时间约束的通用推理算法，通过将LTLf公式编译为DFA并引导受限束搜索，保证约束满足并提升输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在生成和分类任务中表现优异，但其输出无法保证满足时间约束（如LTLf），因此需要一种无需重新训练的通用解决方案。

Method: TRIDENT将LTLf公式编译为DFA，在解码步骤中屏蔽违反约束的路径，并动态重排剩余路径，结合模型概率和DFA接受结构。

Result: TRIDENT在图像流分类和可控文本生成任务中实现完美约束满足，同时提升效率和质量。

Conclusion: TRIDENT为LLM提供了一种高效且通用的方法，确保输出满足时间约束，同时保持高质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

TL;DR: Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs) 通过长前馈连接替代传统短残差连接，实现信息自动压缩，提升表示质量，减少计算冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加深度常导致计算冗余而无表示质量提升，ACNs旨在通过架构设计实现动态信息压缩。

Method: ACNs采用从每层到输出的长前馈连接，通过梯度下降实现信息自动压缩。

Result: ACNs在噪声鲁棒性、低数据性能、迁移学习和灾难性遗忘方面表现优异，参数更少但泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: ACNs是一种高效架构，能自动适应任务复杂度并学习鲁棒表示。

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated
remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces
computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation
quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an
architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each
layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs
showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a
network to organically compress information during training with gradient
descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,
information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training,
enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in
deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise
training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during
training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced
noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in
low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that
generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to
18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression
while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT
architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional
pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance
trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish
ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that
automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while
learning robust representations.

Motivation: 解决长期自回归预测的稳定性问题，挑战非标准数据表示是必要的假设。

Method: 提出AtmosMJ，一种直接在标准经纬度网格上操作的深度卷积网络，采用GRF机制防止误差累积。

Result: AtmosMJ实现约500天的稳定预测，10天预测精度与先进模型相当，训练预算仅5.7天。

Conclusion: 高效架构设计而非非标准数据表示是实现长期稳定预测的关键。

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

Conclusion: 论文为MG-LLM在多模态图数据与任务中的泛化研究提供了贡献。

Abstract: Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and
relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing
multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for
specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal
graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of
Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across
diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of
multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent
multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.
Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)
unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of
handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context
learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)
multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review
related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards
realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing
multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper
can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for
generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

Conclusion: 通过特征工程驱动的规划和选择性LLM利用，构建了高效且可解释的决策支持系统。

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决去中心化联邦学习中因非独立同分布数据和负载不均导致的训练时间长和收敛慢的问题。

Method: 将全局优化问题分解为节点级子问题，引入方差约束以平衡数据利用，并通过目标函数最小化训练延迟。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上的仿真显示，Load-aware Tram-FL显著减少训练时间并加速收敛。

Conclusion: Load-aware Tram-FL通过负载感知调度，有效优化了去中心化联邦学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有对比学习目标缺乏系统性解释框架，作者旨在提供一个统一视角，分析正负对相似性的影响。

Method: 通过分析余弦相似性，研究全批次和小批次设置下的CL行为，并提出辅助损失项以减少负对相似性方差。

Result: 全批次中正对完美对齐受限，小批次中负对分离更强且方差更大。辅助损失项有效提升了小批次训练性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架和辅助损失项为对比学习提供了新的理论支持和实践改进。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle:
embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs
are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed
and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive
framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In
this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based
on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative
pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs
is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain
threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating
within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller
batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches,
which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address
this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that
reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results
demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the
performance of CL methods in small-batch training.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Motivation: 现实中的图数据常包含敏感信息，本地隐私图学习协议虽能保护隐私，但可能面临数据投毒攻击的威胁。

Method: 攻击者通过注入虚假用户并操纵其与真实用户的链接，发送精心设计的数据以破坏图学习的效用。

Result: 攻击在理论和实验上均被证明有效，现有防御策略效果有限。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的防御机制以确保隐私保护图学习的安全性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many
real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles
in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

Result: ProjNCE在多个数据集和设置中表现优于SupCon和标准交叉熵训练。

Conclusion: ProjNCE从互信息解释和投影设计两方面改进了SupCon，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple
perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However,
supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little
attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to
form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon
and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a
generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised
contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment
term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and
affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class
embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based
class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that
ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy
training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary
perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and
offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the
foundational contrastive objective.

Result: 理论证明和实际案例（LLM评估和医院质量评估）验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from
a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for
efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a
``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely
clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to
formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of
evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which
guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position
cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no
alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small
error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number
of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We
also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input
on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to
practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital
quality evaluation.

Result: 稀疏系统在实际相关稀疏性条件下可能不可识别，且理论不可识别性在现有估计方法中体现。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁重新思考数据驱动动态系统建模的预期，并为评估学习模型的可靠性提供量化依据。

Abstract: Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across
natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned
from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are
not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior
under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer
the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory."
However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains
underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally
in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this
gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to
the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive
probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds
for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical
unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs
from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically
unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive
biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be
expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative
assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

Conclusion: WoLA为解决联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击问题提供了一种高效方法，尤其在数据异构环境下表现突出。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple
data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing
their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally
update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or
model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it
opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine)
participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming
model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that
the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this
purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation,
assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than
honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest
gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest
outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label
Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients
despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines'
gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and
empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

Result: GGC在Jet Tagging任务中表现优于单独使用自动编码器和传统GNN分类器。

Conclusion: GGC不仅提升了性能，还为在真实数据集上测试新型QGNN提供了可能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the
classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties,
utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils,
governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the
sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are
systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve
as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant
sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly
well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is
developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the
corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated
using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in
distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the
random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil
identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high
performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization
in industrial environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中拜占庭客户端弹性和客户数据隐私的挑战，尤其是在数据异构性下现有方法失效的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段方法，结合可验证秘密共享、安全聚合和定制对称私有信息检索方案。

Result: 在各种攻击下验证了方案的有效性，并优于现有技术。同时通过零阶估计方法降低通信成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据异构性下实现了隐私和弹性的平衡，并通过通信优化提升了可扩展性。

Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the
clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the
clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an
information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while
ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the
countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable
pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown
to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous
setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with
the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of
verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private
information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy
guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms
the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure
aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order
estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL
tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.

TL;DR: 论文研究了单指标模型的学习问题，提出球形谐波是更自然的基函数，并基于此设计了两种估计器，分别优化样本复杂度或运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明高斯输入下恢复单指标模型的复杂性由链接函数的Hermite展开决定，但作者认为球形谐波更能捕捉问题的旋转对称性。

Method: 提出基于张量展开和在线SGD的两类估计器，分别优化样本复杂度和运行时间。

Result: 在任意球对称输入分布下，理论不仅复现了现有结果，还揭示了新现象。

Conclusion: 球形谐波是更合适的基函数，两类估计器各有优势，但可能无法同时优化样本复杂度和运行时间。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in
\mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through
an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle
\boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under
Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering
$\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function.
In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical
harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis
for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building
on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models
under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two
families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that
respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and
argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized
to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results
but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS)的方法，通过自然语言提示改进大语言模型(LLMs)从伯努利分布中生成样本的准确性，减少采样偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能准确描述概率分布但生成样本时存在偏差，限制了其在需要可靠随机性的任务中的应用。

Method: 引入VRS，一种基于自然语言的拒绝采样方法，通过提示LLM对样本进行推理和接受/拒绝。

Result: VRS显著减少了采样偏差，理论分析表明其在温和假设下优于直接采样。

Conclusion: 研究表明经典概率工具可通过自然语言嵌入LLM工作流，提升可靠性，无需访问模型内部或复杂提示工程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

Result: 模拟器能准确学习气候动态，并在合成数据集和实际气候模型数据中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、可解释的气候模拟提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Motivation: 探索VQVAE在高信噪比射频数据对抗攻击中的防御能力。

Method: 设计保留相位的对抗攻击，比较其与不保留相位攻击的效果，并通过VQVAE重建评估攻击抑制能力。

Result: VQVAE显著降低了攻击效果，离散潜在空间特性有助于攻击检测。

Conclusion: VQVAE在对抗攻击中表现出良好的防御潜力，离散潜在空间特性为攻击检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete
latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the
original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when
an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF)
data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally
modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve
the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are
adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same
intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of
such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on
the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of
the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE
of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the
effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the
attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using
multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the
VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we
observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the
attacks.

Conclusion: DNA不仅提升了可解释性，还为强化学习的探索和自适应规划开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to
explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives
(DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for
trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively
diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these
distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of
available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,
DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where
agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which
uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for
distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it
successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute
meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to
related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for
exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器遗忘（MU）用于隐私保护和合规性，但也可能增加模型攻击面。现有攻击方法依赖较弱威胁模型，需访问原始和遗忘模型，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出Apollo攻击，基于严格威胁模型，仅需遗忘模型的标签输出，推断样本是否被遗忘。

Result: Apollo攻击在较少访问目标模型的情况下，仍能高精度推断遗忘样本的成员状态。

Conclusion: Apollo攻击展示了机器遗忘场景下隐私泄露的新风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following
requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model
efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU
itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory
compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing
privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the
unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has
access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their
feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A
Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that
infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat
model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model
only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to
the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high
precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

Motivation: 传统矩阵分解缺乏不确定性量化，PMF通过概率分布解决了这一问题，但后验计算困难。

Method: 采用MCMC和VI两种贝叶斯推断方法近似后验分布。

Result: 实验表明VI收敛速度更快，MCMC后验估计更准确。

Conclusion: VI适合快速收敛场景，MCMC适合高精度需求。

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems.
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix
factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors,
allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior
distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address
this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We
evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence
speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more
accurate posterior estimates.

Motivation: 信息不对称和知识迁移是多智能体系统中的核心挑战，尤其是在经济学和社会科学中。本文旨在解决这些问题，以优化智能体的策略学习。

Method: 提出了一种样本高效算法，通过非独立同分布动作学习混杂因素，并在在线战略交互模型中实现知识迁移。

Result: 算法在样本复杂度为$O(1/\epsilon^2)$的情况下，能够学习到$\epsilon$-最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法在信息不对称和知识迁移的复杂环境中表现出色，为强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型在生成任务中表现优异，但其建模能力导致类别特征与无关上下文纠缠，影响鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 通过识别CLAReps（保留核心类别信息的潜在表示），开发了CaDistill范式，利用CDM作为教师模型，仅通过CLAReps传递核心类别知识。

Result: 学生模型在仅使用10%训练数据的情况下，表现出强大的对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: CDMs不仅可以作为图像生成器，还能作为紧凑、可解释的教师模型，推动鲁棒表示学习。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

Motivation: 受AR-LLMs中隐式并行性的启发，开发一种原生支持并行生成的模型，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 采用MapReduce范式，分为Map、Process和Reduce三阶段；设计Multiverse Attention和Multiverse Engine，支持并行推理。

Result: Multiverse-32B在3小时微调后性能与同类AR-LLMs相当，效率提升2倍，扩展性更优。

Conclusion: Multiverse展示了并行生成模型的潜力，为高效推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its
utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a
probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced

evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from
collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically
plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without
requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly
pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this
approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets
and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal
modeling workflows.

Motivation: 当前支持证明生成的验证工具无法处理基于抽象的推理，限制了验证的可扩展性和可靠性。

Result: 初步实现了支持常见抽象技术的可扩展且可信的验证框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN验证提供了可扩展性和形式化证明的结合，增强了验证的可靠性。

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely
on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof
production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of
DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not
support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and
provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for
proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly
separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the
correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the
abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by
existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for
generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable
scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction
techniques within a formal proof framework.

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human
supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful
incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily
criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human
principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre),
model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting
the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and
ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric
fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents
learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex
problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the
proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a
fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end
(human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive
and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm
which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision
making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured
over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an
agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on
our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages,
under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research
hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic,
interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are
turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the
anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding
whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or
instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of
technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical
challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human
intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed
for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic
systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and
system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived
enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived
usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and
learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,
we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student
perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted
trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral
intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived
enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we
propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots
(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of
trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific
to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately
calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical
impact of AI in education.

### [280] [UTBoost: Rigorous Evaluation of Coding Agents on SWE-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09289)
*Boxi Yu,Yuxuan Zhu,Pinjia He,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出UTGenerator和UTBoost，通过LLM生成测试用例以解决SWE-Bench中测试不足的问题，并修正了345个错误补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE-Bench中手动编写的测试用例不足，导致生成的补丁可能通过测试但未解决问题。

Method: 引入UTGenerator（LLM驱动的测试用例生成器）和UTBoost（测试用例增强框架），自动分析代码库生成测试用例。

Result: 修正了345个错误补丁，影响了SWE-Bench Lite和Verified排行榜的40.9%和24.4%条目，分别导致18和11个排名变化。

Conclusion: UTGenerator和UTBoost有效提升了测试用例的质量，显著改善了代码生成代理的评估准确性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard
entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.

### [281] [Reasoning as a Resource: Optimizing Fast and Slow Thinking in Code Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09396)
*Zongjie Li,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出将推理深度作为可控资源，优化代码生成模型的设计，以平衡快速直接答案与详细推理之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成模型未明确管理推理深度，导致在准确性、延迟和成本之间缺乏优化。

Method: 通过自适应控制推理深度，从合成数据创建到实际部署，优化整个模型生命周期的推理预算。

Result: 该方法可增强监督信号，推动多维度基准测试，并支持成本和安全意识强的部署策略。

Conclusion: 将快速和慢速推理视为互补模式，可设计出在必要时深入思考、在可能时快速行动的编码代理。

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation
models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being
an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between
rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought
deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that
optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic
data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior
trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive
control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new
multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious
deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes
to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and
act fast when possible.

### [282] [Stakeholder Participation for Responsible AI Development: Disconnects Between Guidance and Current Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09873)
*Emma Kallina,Thomas Bohné,Jat Singh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了现有利益相关者参与（SHI）实践对负责任AI（rAI）的贡献，发现商业驱动的SHI与rAI目标存在脱节，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨SHI在商业软件开发中的实践是否能够支持rAI的发展，以及潜在的脱节问题。

Method: 分析了56份rAI指导文件，并进行了在线调查（n=130）和半结构化访谈（n=10）。

Result: 商业SHI主要受商业目标驱动，与rAI目标（如权力再分配、风险预测）脱节。

Conclusion: 需通过干预和研究机会推动SHI实践与rAI目标对齐。

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement
(SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in
commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This
study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to
contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential
insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry
practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to
identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and
uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical
understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To
understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we
then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)
with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily
driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several
factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that
established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To
address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to
advance rAI development in practice.

### [283] [Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167)
*James R. Williamson,Andrew Alini,Brian A. Telfer,Adam W. Potter,Karl E. Friedl*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究通过两种方法（特征工程和深度学习）从加速度数据估计内脏脂肪组织（VAT），并结合人口统计和身体测量数据，发现VAT与体力活动（PA）高度相关（r=0.86）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内脏脂肪组织（VAT）是代谢健康和体力活动（PA）的关键标志，过量VAT与2型糖尿病和胰岛素抵抗高度相关。研究旨在探索PA与VAT的关系。

Method: 使用NHANES数据（2011-2014），通过两种方法估计VAT：1）基于步态和睡眠运动的特征工程与岭回归；2）基于24小时连续加速度数据的深度神经网络（基础模型+Transformer）。

Result: 结合两种方法及协变量信息，VAT估计的相关系数达到r=0.86，表明PA与VAT及代谢健康风险密切相关。

Conclusion: 研究证实PA与VAT存在强关联，进一步支持PA对代谢健康的积极影响。

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Motivation: 结合CPC和SNN，以开发更具生物合理性的预测编码模型，利用SNN模拟生物神经系统的计算过程。

Method: 将CPC与SNN结合，构建预测编码模型，并在MNIST数据集上进行测试。

Result: 模型在区分正序样本与非序样本时表现出高分类率，证明SNN可用于分类任务和编码机制。

Conclusion: 研究表明CPC与SNN有效结合，为生物合理预测编码提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图注意力的分散式Actor-Critic方法（GADC），用于优化多无人机系统的服务覆盖范围和电池寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决多无人机系统中服务覆盖范围最大化和电池寿命延长之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用图注意力网络处理局部观测数据，并开发了actor-double-critic网络来管理双目标优化策略，同时使用KL散度因子平衡目标间的权衡。

Result: 在理想和实际环境中测试表明，GADC在性能和可扩展性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GADC在多无人机系统中实现了服务覆盖和电池寿命的双重优化，具有显著优势。

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

*Saeed Hashemi,Genchang Peng,Mehrdad Nourani,Omar Nofal,Jay Harvey*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的SEEG通道排序方法，结合临床选择和计算分析，利用XGBoost和SHAP评分提高癫痫发作相关通道的识别效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SEEG信号视觉检查效率低下，需自动化方法辅助识别关键通道。

Method: 使用XGBoost训练分类模型，结合SHAP评分和通道扩展策略，识别癫痫发作相关通道。

Result: 在五例患者数据中验证，表现出高准确性、一致性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效辅助临床识别癫痫发作相关通道，提高诊断效率。

Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant
depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection
of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and
inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful
channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A
classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative
features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their
contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to
expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond
those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were
analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
explainability.

Motivation: 解决多通道信号在跨通道测量中因样本与通道不匹配而难以恢复的问题，特别是在复杂信号结构和实际应用（如自由移动生物的全脑钙成像）中。

Method: 将跨通道无标记感知框架扩展到子空间联合信号，推导更紧的样本需求量界限，支持更广泛的信号类型。

Result: 在全脑钙成像中验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确的信号重建。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于样本与通道关联不精确的实际场景，扩展了应用范围并提升了重建性能。

Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a
multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This
work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie
in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal
structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These
mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as
whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target
tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the
required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more
general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in
whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron
mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings
with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal
reconstruction.

Motivation: Devanagari手写数字识别对多语言文档数字化、教育工具和文化遗产保护至关重要，但其复杂结构和有限标注数据对传统模型构成挑战。

Method: 采用CNN进行空间特征提取，结合10量子比特变分量子电路（VQC）进行量子增强分类。

Result: 模型在DHCD数据集上实现了99.80%的测试准确率，测试损失为0.2893，平均每类F1分数为0.9980，优于传统CNN。

Conclusion: 该研究为区域文字识别设立了新基准，展示了量子机器学习在低资源语言场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

TL;DR: ThinkQE是一个基于LLM的查询扩展框架，通过深度语义探索和语料库反馈迭代优化，显著提升了查询扩展的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法生成的查询扩展过于狭窄，未能满足多样性和全面性的需求。

Method: 提出ThinkQE框架，包含基于思考的扩展过程和语料库交互策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试（DL19、DL20、BRIGHT）上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ThinkQE通过深度探索和反馈优化，显著提升了查询扩展的性能。

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

Motivation: 互补产品推荐能提升用户体验和零售销售额，但由于用户-物品交互数据的噪声和稀疏性，推荐难度较大。

Method: 通过将用户-物品二分图投影为有向加权图，从中推断互补关系，提出了一种简单有效的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中平均优于序列和基于图的推荐方法，分别提升43%和38%。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然简单，但在互补产品推荐任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation is a powerful strategy to improve
customer experience and retail sales. However, recommending the right product
is not a simple task because of the noisy and sparse nature of user-item
interactions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to predict
a list of complementary products given a query item, based on the structure of
a directed weighted graph projected from the user-item bipartite graph. We
revisit bipartite graph projections for recommender systems and propose a novel
approach for inferring complementarity relationships from historical user-item
interactions. We compare our model with recent methods from the literature and
show, despite the simplicity of our approach, an average improvement of +43%
and +38% over sequential and graph-based recommenders, respectively, over
different benchmarks.

learning with image transforms derived from eye gaze variables to diagnose ASD.
This facilitates and opens opportunities for in-home periodical diagnosis,
reducing stress for individuals and caregivers, while also preserving user
privacy through the use of image transforms. The accessibility of the proposed
method also offers opportunities for improved communication between guardians

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by
learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on
manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies
for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each
imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we
discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单先验或物理模型的重建方法在处理高度欠采样、高维数据时效果不佳，需要更优解决方案。

Method: LoREIN结合低秩表示（LRR）和隐式神经表示（INR），利用双先验增强重建保真度。

Result: 该方法能高保真重建加权图像，并提升定量参数图的重建精度。

Conclusion: LoREIN为零样本学习范式提供了潜力，推动了医学影像领域的进步。

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of brain abnormalities, such as tumors and
strokes, is essential for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In
this study, we present a deep learning-based system capable of identifying both
brain tumors and strokes from MRI images, along with their respective stages.
We have executed two groundbreaking strategies involving convolutional neural
networks, MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50-optimized through transfer learning to
classify MRI scans into five diagnostic categories. Our dataset, aggregated and
augmented from various publicly available MRI sources, was carefully curated to
ensure class balance and image diversity. To enhance model generalization and
prevent overfitting, we applied dropout layers and extensive data augmentation.
The models achieved strong performance, with training accuracy reaching 93\%
and validation accuracy up to 88\%. While ResNet-50 demonstrated slightly
better results, Mobile Net V2 remains a promising option for real-time
diagnosis in low resource settings due to its lightweight architecture. This
research offers a practical AI-driven solution for early brain abnormality
detection, with potential for clinical deployment and future enhancement

Resource of AI (MIRA). The dataset was created for the RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine
Degenerative Classification competition where competitors developed deep
learning models to grade degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. The degree
of spinal canal, subarticular recess, and neural foraminal stenosis was graded
at each intervertebral disc level in the lumbar spine. The images were
annotated by expert volunteer neuroradiologists and musculoskeletal
radiologists from the RSNA, American Society of Neuroradiology, and the
American Society of Spine Radiology. This dataset aims to facilitate research
and development in machine learning and lumbar spine imaging to lead to
improved patient care and clinical efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了首个大型多中心口腔细胞学数据集，旨在通过AI改进口腔鳞状细胞癌（OSCC）的早期诊断，尤其在资源有限的地区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OSCC诊断方法（如组织病理学）在资源匮乏地区难以普及，而口腔细胞学结合AI可能提供低成本、非侵入的替代方案。

Method: 研究团队收集了来自印度十个医疗中心的PAP和MGG染色口腔细胞学切片，由病理专家标注，用于训练AI模型。

Result: 该数据集填补了公开口腔细胞学数据的空白，有望提升AI诊断的准确性和可及性。

Conclusion: 该资源有望降低诊断错误率，改善OSCC早期诊断，从而减少死亡率并提升全球患者预后。

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden,
particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where
it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection
dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent
survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited
accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive,
resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral
cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost
alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability
and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial
intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access
to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that
generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter
oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with
Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten
tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by
expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is
designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in
publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance
automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis
in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality
and better patient outcomes worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索INRs在逆问题中的样本需求，填补传统像素表示与INRs在样本复杂度上的知识空白。

Method: 使用带ReLU激活和傅里叶特征层的单隐藏层INR，结合广义权重衰减正则化，分析非凸优化问题的解。

Result: 确定了INR图像从低通傅里叶样本中精确恢复的充分样本数量，并通过实验验证了理论。

Conclusion: INRs在连续域图像恢复中具有潜力，理论支持其在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs
represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network
taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel
representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating
images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,
we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image
from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with
ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight
decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this
non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex
penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a
sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is
exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our
theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of
images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the
performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom
images.

*Hetvi Waghela,Jaydip Sen,Sneha Rakshit,Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态上下文扰动（DCP）的新型对抗文本攻击方案，通过动态生成上下文感知的扰动，确保语义保真和流畅性，显著提升了对抗攻击的隐蔽性和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法通常局限于单词或局部文本片段，忽略了更广泛的上下文，导致扰动可检测或语义不一致。

Method: 利用预训练语言模型，通过对抗目标函数迭代优化扰动，平衡模型误分类和文本自然性。

Result: 实验表明，DCP能有效挑战现有NLP模型的鲁棒性，生成更接近自然语言的对抗样本。

Conclusion: 研究强调了上下文在对抗攻击中的关键作用，为构建更鲁棒的NLP系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated
adversarial strategies.

Motivation: 揭示深度学习模型在恶意软件检测中如何依赖虚假相关性，尤其是编译器留下的空白空间，以量化其对决策的影响。

Method: 在小规模平衡数据集上进行实验，分析两种端到端模型对虚假相关性的依赖程度。

Result: 研究发现模型过度依赖编译器留下的空白空间，降低了编译代码的相关性。

Conclusion: 通过分析，论文对两种模型的适用性进行了排名，为实际部署提供了参考。

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting
malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations
-- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless
through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks
mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without
quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware
detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the
compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our
seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of
two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in
production.

TL;DR: DAVSP是一种通过视觉安全提示和深度对齐技术增强大型视觉语言模型安全性的方法，有效抵御恶意查询同时保持良性输入的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法难以在抵御恶意查询的同时保持良性输入的实用性，DAVSP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出视觉安全提示（在输入图像周围添加可训练填充区域）和深度对齐（通过激活空间监督训练提示），增强模型对恶意查询的感知能力。

Result: 在五个基准测试和两种代表性LVLM上，DAVSP有效抵御恶意查询并保持良性输入实用性，且具有跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAVSP通过视觉安全提示和深度对齐的联合作用，显著提升了模型的安全性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across
various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit
the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist
malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To
address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),
which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety
Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It
preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we
propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt
through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent
ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than
prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative
LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while
preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model
generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety
Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its
overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了在生成合成轨迹时如何平衡隐私保护（差分隐私）与数据效用，评估了不同模型和方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在轨迹数据生成中如何实现隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，尤其是当前方法缺乏正式隐私保证的问题。

Method: 使用DP-SGD评估生成模型的效用，提出新的DP机制用于条件生成，并比较Diffusion、VAE和GAN模型的性能。

Result: DP-SGD显著影响性能，但大数据集下仍保留一定效用；新DP机制提升训练稳定性；Diffusion模型无隐私保证时表现最佳，而GAN在DP-SGD下最优。

Conclusion: DP轨迹生成仍具挑战性，正式隐私保证目前仅适用于大数据集和受限场景。

Abstract: While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal
sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal
protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains
challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to
produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy
guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during
generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such
models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven
utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method
for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.
(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP
mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess
its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN
- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD
significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the
datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training
stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as
GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without
guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best
non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.
In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal
guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained
use cases.

TL;DR: TooBadRL是首个系统优化DRL后门攻击触发器的框架，通过时间、空间和幅度三个关键维度提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击依赖简单启发式触发器配置，忽视了触发器优化的潜在效果。

Method: 引入性能感知的自适应冻结机制、合作游戏维度选择及梯度优化注入幅度。

Result: 在三种主流DRL算法和九项基准任务中显著提高攻击成功率，同时最小化正常任务性能损失。

Conclusion: 触发器优化在DRL后门攻击中的重要性被低估，TooBadRL展示了其显著效果。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare,
smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can
efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute
backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns
are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks
rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking
the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we
introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor
Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor
triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.
Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing
mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a
cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most
influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose
a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude
under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms
and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack
success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.
These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of
principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of
TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.

Result: 挑战收集了208,095次攻击提交，涉及多种防御策略、LLM架构和检索配置，提供了丰富的数据集。

Conclusion: 论文希望通过发布挑战代码和数据集，为未来研究提供基础，推动解决提示注入问题的实用结构方案。

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their
inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against
adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have
wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based
applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a
public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants
adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to
trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge
spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval
configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions
from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of
submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new
insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve
as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to
prompt injection.

Conclusion: 机器学习为PEALD工艺优化提供了新途径，并可扩展至原子层刻蚀等复杂结构。

Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic
layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based
processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can
dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to
unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside
nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on
simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation
times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated
conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in
undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation
times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine
whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a
PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning
can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in
areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic
layer etching and more complex structures.

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like

loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates

Motivation: 传统优化方法在处理复杂工程系统中的依赖关系时，难以捕捉上下文细微差别，导致效果不佳。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在收敛速度和解决方案质量上均优于随机和确定性基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM通过结合语义和数学推理，为解决复杂工程优化问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or
development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure
Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and
enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging
combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations.
As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate,
traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often
fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective
solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for
advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based
framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for
iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem.
Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves
faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic
and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual
domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of
the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical
reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based
engineering design optimization.

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced
engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent
decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and
interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models
(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general
knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for
further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper
introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by
agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four
distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning
models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of
multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and
discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design
processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems.
Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID
4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design
implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design
goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a
foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity,
autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design
challenges.

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large
language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most
students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this
important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are
rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual
abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The
problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining
principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not
only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,
and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the
students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better
than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the
best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is
a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of
human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the

Conclusion: STREAMINGGS显著提升了3DGS在移动设备上的性能和能效。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on
compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM
traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS
algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and
reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动插值方法依赖复杂模型，而本文探索简单模型通过数据优化实现高质量动画的可能性。

Method: 使用单一Transformer编码器，重点优化数据建模（如数据量、姿态表示和速度特征）。

Result: 实验表明，数据优化可提升运动过渡质量，挑战了模型复杂度决定动画质量的假设。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法在运动插值中具有潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合扩散模型和物理渲染，实现了高质量3D材质生成。

Abstract: We leverage finetuned video diffusion models, intrinsic decomposition of
videos, and physically-based differentiable rendering to generate high quality
materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a
video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,
roughness, metallic) from the generated video. Finally, we use the intrinsics
alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly
extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.

TL;DR: DGS-LRM是首个基于单目视频的动态场景3D高斯点云预测方法，解决了动态场景重建的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于静态场景，无法重建动态物体运动，亟需解决训练数据稀缺和3D表示问题。

Method: 提出合成数据集、可变形3D高斯点云表示和大规模Transformer网络，实现实时动态重建。

Result: DGS-LRM在动态重建质量上媲美优化方法，优于现有预测方法，且支持长程3D跟踪。

Conclusion: DGS-LRM为动态场景重建提供了高效、通用的解决方案，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D
tracking methods.

Method: 使用BERT语言模型作为自动说话人验证系统，分析VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge数据集中的语言内容相似性。

Result: 平均等错误率为35%，部分说话人低至2%，系统决策与语义相似关键词相关。

Conclusion: 建议重新设计VoicePrivacy数据集以确保公平评估，并质疑全局等错误率在隐私评估中的可靠性。

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于音频和转录的自动定位方法，用于评估Prolonged Exposure (PE)治疗中治疗师的忠诚度，减少人工审核负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估PE治疗师忠诚度的方法依赖人工审核录音，效率低下且耗时。

Method: 利用预训练音频-语言模型Qwen2-Audio，通过LoRA微调处理30秒音频-转录窗口，生成核心治疗阶段的标签。

Result: 在313个真实PE会话数据集上，最佳配置（LoRA rank 8, 30s窗口）的MAE为5.3秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为PE治疗忠诚度跟踪提供了可扩展框架，有助于临床培训和质量保证。

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

Motivation: 神经前端在ASR系统中表现不如传统方法，主要原因是过拟合问题。

Method: 研究了音频扰动方法，并提出STFT域掩码作为改进SpecAugment的方案。

Result: 结合两种正则化方法后，可学习特征与传统特征的性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: 正则化方法有效提升了可学习特征前端的性能，使其接近传统方法。

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Motivation: 现有视觉功能预测方法依赖人工标注或预定义任务集，限制了在非结构化环境中的泛化能力。

Result: UAD在仿真环境中训练，但在真实场景和人类活动中表现出色，模仿学习策略泛化能力强。

Conclusion: UAD为机器人操作提供了一种高效、泛化性强的功能预测方法，适用于多样化任务和场景。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance

Method: Adv-BMT框架采用双向运动变换器（BMT）进行逆时序交通运动预测，分两阶段生成对抗性交互。

Result: 实验表明，Adv-BMT生成的碰撞场景质量高，训练后碰撞率降低20%。

Conclusion: Adv-BMT有效提升了自动驾驶测试的数据多样性，显著降低了碰撞率。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics

Result: 在DSEC、Gen1和1Mpx数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX上实现35 FPS的实时处理。

Conclusion: WD-DETR有效解决了事件相机检测中的噪声问题，适合机器人实时感知。

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

Result: PCD能捕捉不同天气条件下的感知可靠性差异，而静态指标无法做到。

Conclusion: PCD为自动驾驶系统提供了更安全的感知性能评估方法，SensorRainFall数据集和开源代码为研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at

evaluation code is open-sourced at

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优异，抓取透明和反射物体的成功率提升44%。

Conclusion: DCIRNet有效解决了透明和反射物体的深度估计问题，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks
across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like
morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body
control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement
learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each
task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and
scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce
SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains
goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends
these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal
task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel,
cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments,
four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks,
accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and
feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid
reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse
loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be

Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending
their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications.
Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to
perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts
demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on
relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables
quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging
the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg,
the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its
back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert
policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object
positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert
policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for
coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped
legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding
their role beyond locomotion.

*Ye Niu,Sanping Zhou,Yizhe Li,Ye Den,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时间统一的扩散策略（TUDP），通过动作识别能力构建时间统一的去噪过程，提高了机器人动作生成的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的策略方法在机器人操作中需要大量时间迭代去噪，且时间变化的动作去噪过程增加了模型训练难度，导致动作准确性不足。

Method: TUDP通过构建时间统一的速度场和引入动作判别分支，统一了动作去噪的所有时间步，并提供了额外的动作判别信息。

Result: TUDP在RLBench上实现了82.6%（多视角）和83.8%（单视角）的最高成功率，且在较少去噪迭代时表现更优。

Conclusion: TUDP通过时间统一的去噪过程和动作判别训练，显著提高了机器人动作生成的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models
to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion
model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs
well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,
the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to
iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic
manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action
denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model
training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions
efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy
(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified
denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in
action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all
timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of
policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose
an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination
branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through
action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern
successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%
on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when
using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement
in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide
range of real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的仿真任务套件，用于评估视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的泛化能力，发现VLM预训练虽能提升感知和规划能力，但在动作执行上表现不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型的评估不足，缺乏标准化任务和语言指令，且未深入探讨VLM预训练对机器人策略泛化能力的影响。

Method: 引入包含50个仿真任务的统一套件，涵盖语言指令、视觉和对象，并系统评估多种VLA架构。

Result: VLM骨干赋予VLA模型强大的感知和规划能力（"良好意图"），但在动作执行上表现不稳定，且微调可能削弱VLM的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 发布任务套件和评估代码，作为未来VLA研究的标准化基准，推动感知到动作的差距研究。

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过定制不透射线标记物实现微导管形状和姿态同步估计的方法，以减少神经介入手术中的感知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经介入手术中，医生需要从双平面透视图像中重建和预测导管运动，感知负担重，现有追踪方法不适用于微导管。

Method: 在导管上布置定制不透射线标记物，设计标记物排列以减少对追踪不确定性的敏感性。

Result: 在直径小于2mm的微导管上应用，形状追踪误差小于1mm，导管滚动误差低于40度。

Conclusion: 该方法可实现双平面成像下导管的自主导航。

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) 是一种基于轨迹自回归建模的新型视觉运动策略范式，通过反向推理生成完整轨迹，实现了全局到局部的动作约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅正向预测下一步动作，而 CoA 通过任务目标驱动的反向推理，提升动作生成的全局一致性。

Method: CoA 采用自回归结构，首动作标记为关键帧，后续动作基于关键帧和已预测动作生成，并结合四种设计优化动作推理。

Result: CoA 在 60 个 RLBench 任务和 8 个真实世界操作任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CoA 在保持灵活性的同时，显著提升了空间泛化能力。

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

Result: SAFE在模拟和真实环境中测试，表现优于基线，达到最佳准确率和检测时间平衡。

Conclusion: SAFE是一种高效的通用故障检测器，适用于多种策略架构。

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative
results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化环境中，机器人需要感知物理交互中的力，但现有触觉传感器缺乏通用性和可定制性。

Method: eFlesh传感器由3D打印的微结构、现成磁铁和磁力计电路板组成，提供开源设计工具支持定制。

Result: 实验显示，eFlesh在接触定位和力预测方面表现优异，并提升了机器人操作的性能。

Conclusion: eFlesh为机器人触觉感知提供了低成本、高可定制的解决方案，并开源了所有设计文件。

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仓库自动化对提高效率和降低成本至关重要，但现有研究多依赖启发式方法，缺乏数据驱动的优化方法。

Method: 提出ML框架，预测调整和优化吸盘选择，以提升拣选成功率。

Result: 在200万次拣选中，失败率降低了20%。

Conclusion: 该框架在大规模仓库自动化中表现出显著效果。

Abstract: Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational
efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce
variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine
learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic
fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts
primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using
heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging
data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better
performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that
predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction
cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success
probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells
that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,
which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the
proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a
heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in
large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

Method: 采用六阶段工作流程（发布、发现、招募、执行、结算、反馈）进行动态任务分配，支持多维声誉系统和故障容错，使用$ISEK代币进行经济激励和治理。

Result: ISEK结合区块链、人工智能和激励机制，实现了大规模去中心化认知系统的有机发展，超越了中心化限制。

Conclusion: ISEK代表了从传统平台向去中心化认知系统的范式转变，为自主代理的集体进化提供了基础设施。

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

Result: CRAFT优于传统越狱方法，但现有防御策略仍不足。

Conclusion: 需更强研究驱动的保护措施以抵御对抗攻击。

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

Conclusion: 该框架优于3GPP标准设置，展示了NTN在支持可持续网络中的重要作用。

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures
offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for
the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for
these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load
and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less
attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of
terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in
supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online
optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback
Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively
optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment
(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network
capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations
over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the
proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%
throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming
standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

Abstract: Real-time network traffic forecasting is crucial for network management and
early resource allocation. Existing network traffic forecasting approaches
operate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed.
However, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to
various human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model
approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly,
we model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem.
Secondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank
structure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model
effectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data
during pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent
representation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing
the high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which
simplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also
establish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of
the proposed approach. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves accurate network traffic forecasting within 100 ms, with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.002, as validated on the Abilene dataset.

Conclusion: 改进后的方法在不精确梯度设置下具有潜力，为大规模优化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance
estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods
are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations.
Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using
fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems
on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient
descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first
shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic
shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All
methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two
different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both
accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening
factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened
methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.

TL;DR: AI驱动的系统通过LLM模拟求助者并提供实时建议，提升同伴支持质量，但专家指出其潜在问题，强调标准化训练的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理健康问题日益严重，AI驱动的同伴支持系统有望扩大心理社会支持的可及性，但需解决质量和安全性问题。

Method: 开发并评估了一个AI支持系统，包括LLM模拟求助者、情境敏感建议和实时情绪可视化，通过混合方法研究验证其效果。

Result: 同伴支持者和专家均认可系统的潜力，但专家发现同伴支持者的回应存在关键问题，如忽略求助信号和过早建议。

Conclusion: 需标准化且心理学基础扎实的训练，同时LLM支持系统需谨慎设计并由专家指导，以负责任地整合AI于心理健康领域。

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by
providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems.
As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact
of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts.
This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in
Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments.
Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing
design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.

### [342] [EdgeProfiler: A Fast Profiling Framework for Lightweight LLMs on Edge Using Analytical Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09061)
*Alyssa Pinnock,Shakya Jayakody,Kawsher A Roxy,Md Rubel Ahmed*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EdgeProfiler是一个快速分析框架，用于评估边缘系统上的轻量级大语言模型（LLMs），通过量化技术和内存约束优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的高计算、内存和功耗需求通常限制其在云端运行，EdgeProfiler旨在解决这一问题，使其适用于资源受限的边缘环境。

Method: 框架采用4位量化技术分析TinyLLaMA等轻量级LLMs，结合分析模型估计延迟、FLOPs和能耗。

Result: 4位量化减少内存使用60-70%，精度损失2-5%，推理速度提升2-3倍，能耗降低35-50%。

Conclusion: EdgeProfiler为轻量级LLMs在边缘环境中的高效部署提供了平衡精度、能耗和计算可行性的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for
evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs
offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,
their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to
cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a
systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained
edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,
Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization
techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to
estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that
4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while
maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds
are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge
devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for
INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as
Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the
importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge
environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational
feasibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管设备能力提升，边缘设备因内存和功耗限制难以高效运行大型语言模型，现有方法需在精度和效率间权衡。

Method: SLED方法让轻量边缘设备本地生成候选令牌，边缘服务器批量验证，减少服务器内存占用并支持设备异构性。

Result: 实验显示，SLED显著降低延迟、提高能效，并支持更多并发推理会话，同时保持模型精度。

Conclusion: SLED是一种高效、适应异构边缘环境的大型语言模型推理方法，无需牺牲精度。

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing
advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to
limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as
aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for
efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces
a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily
as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as
a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating
computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows
lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using
diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches
and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach
supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by
avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments
with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate
substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy
efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without
sacrificing model accuracy.

TL;DR: TTrace是一个用于检测和定位分布式训练中无声错误的系统，通过对比单设备参考实现和分布式训练中的中间张量，有效识别错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式训练中的无声错误难以检测和定位，传统调试方法效率低下，TTrace旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TTrace通过精细收集中间张量并与参考实现对比，结合数学分析设置阈值区分错误与浮点舍入误差。

Result: 实验证明TTrace在Megatron-LM框架中检测到11个现有错误和3个新错误，且代码改动少。

Conclusion: TTrace在多种训练场景（如低精度训练）中均有效，为分布式训练提供了可靠的调试工具。

Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural
network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs.
However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them
particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signal
but lead to incorrect training outcome. Effectively detecting and localizing
such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging
practice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be
inefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values
and determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is
difficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.
  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system
capable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace
collects intermediate tensors from distributing training in a fine-grained
manner and compares them against those from a trusted single-device reference
implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the tensors,
we propose novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting
thresholds, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from
floating-point round-off errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace
effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used
Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code change.
TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision
recipes involving BF16 and FP8.

TL;DR: ScalableHD是一种针对多核CPU的高通量超维计算推理方法，通过两阶段流水线执行模型和并行优化，实现了10倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDC方法在推理阶段虽轻量但多依赖专用硬件，多核CPU上的高效推理研究不足。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线执行模型，并行处理基和类超向量，结合内存分块和NUMA感知优化。

Result: 在多种任务中实现10倍吞吐量提升，且扩展性良好。

Conclusion: ScalableHD为多核CPU上的HDC推理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that
represents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called
hypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and
inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often
suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative
training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,
however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,
efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized
hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose
multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and
high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a
two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across
cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are
streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling
on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,
ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.
Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch
sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload
characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits
HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to
10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines
such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity
recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy.
Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of
cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

Motivation: 冷冻电镜（Cryo-EM）在分子生物学中具有革命性意义，但如何建模非刚性构象灵活性和组成变化（如部分缺失）是研究前沿。

Method: 提出了一种基于分层高斯混合模型的新型3D重建框架CryoSPIRE，其结构通过初始部分分割过程提供归纳偏置，以处理构象和组成变化。

Result: CryoSPIRE在复杂实验数据集上揭示了具有生物学意义的结构，并在CryoBench基准测试中达到最新技术水平。

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE为冷冻电镜中的非刚性和组成变化建模提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用ctDNA水平的动态变化进行癌症监测是一种低负担且高潜力的方法，但数据稀疏性是一个挑战。签名理论为处理不规则采样信号提供了新思路。

Method: 结合连续时间马尔可夫模型分析ctDNA动态，利用签名理论构建高效检测流程。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效克服数据稀疏性问题，并高效检测侵袭性癌症。

Conclusion: 该方法为癌症早期检测提供了一种新工具，展示了签名理论在医学领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active
secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring
the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer
detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.
in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for
detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our
approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics
of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient
testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the
Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now
recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled
signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address
the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the
extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our
approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the
efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

Result: 空间邻近性和自然注意轮廓影响任务表征的可用性，个体差异显著。

Conclusion: 将视觉空间注意效应融入计算模型，有助于理解个体如何表征环境以支持规划。

Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive
resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel
problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people
construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the
complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a
nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes
planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this
interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to
characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task
representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We
find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for
planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)
contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful
maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across
individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and
behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the
effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of
value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives
on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals
represent their environments in aid of planning.

Conclusion: 研究表明结构优化可显著提升SET-MLP性能，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to
Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent
this improvement can be achieved.

Abstract: We introduce novel null models for assessing the results obtained from
observed binary transactional and sequence datasets, using statistical
hypothesis testing. Our null models maintain more properties of the observed
dataset than existing ones. Specifically, they preserve the Bipartite Joint
Degree Matrix of the bipartite (multi-)graph corresponding to the dataset,
which ensures that the number of caterpillars, i.e., paths of length three, is
preserved, in addition to other properties considered by other models. We
describe Alice, a suite of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling
datasets from our null models, based on a carefully defined set of states and
efficient operations to move between them. The results of our experimental
evaluation show that Alice mixes fast and scales well, and that our null model

Conclusion: 校准PRMs和IAS框架能有效提升推理效率，减少计算开销。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time
scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that
even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate
success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach,
performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align
with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates
and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive
scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on
the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a
correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number
of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each
instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method
successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline
methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling,
and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining
final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as
desired.

Result: 该方法在高噪声场景中表现出更高的跟踪准确性和鲁棒性，能够有效减少虚假检测的影响。

Conclusion: 混合框架结合了Transformer和贝叶斯滤波的优势，为高噪声多粒子跟踪提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking multiple particles in noisy and cluttered scenes remains challenging
due to a combinatorial explosion of trajectory hypotheses, which scales
super-exponentially with the number of particles and frames. The transformer
architecture has shown a significant improvement in robustness against this
high combinatorial load. However, its performance still falls short of the
conventional Bayesian filtering approaches in scenarios presenting a reduced
set of trajectory hypothesis. This suggests that while transformers excel at
narrowing down possible associations, they may not be able to reach the
optimality of the Bayesian approach in locally sparse scenario. Hence, we
introduce a hybrid tracking framework that combines the ability of
self-attention to learn the underlying representation of particle behavior with
the reliability and interpretability of Bayesian filtering. We perform
trajectory-to-detection association by solving a label prediction problem,
using a transformer encoder to infer soft associations between detections
across frames. This prunes the hypothesis set, enabling efficient
multiple-particle tracking in Bayesian filtering framework. Our approach
demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious
detections, offering a solution for high clutter multiple particle tracking
scenarios.

Conclusion: LLM-CPI通过结合LLMs和在线文本数据，为CPI预测提供了有效的新方法。

Abstract: Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging
task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency,
survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs),
there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for
improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes
LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating
online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts
from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as
ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels
for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted
via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines
monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model
employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and
macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on
LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic
properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction
intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI
are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.

systems against adversarial attacks. However, most of the research in
adversarial machine learning has focused on studying weaknesses against evasion
or poisoning attacks to predictive models in classical setups, with the
susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to attacks remaining
underexplored. This paper introduces a general methodology for designing
optimal evasion attacks against such models. We investigate two adversarial
objectives: perturbing specific point predictions and altering the entire
posterior predictive distribution. For both scenarios, we propose novel
gradient-based attacks and study their implementation and properties in various
computational setups.

*Mattia Rosso,Simone Rossi,Giulio Franzese,Markus Heinonen,Maurizio Filippone*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习中的预测不确定性是否遵循与模型和数据规模相关的缩放规律，并通过实验验证了这种规律的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受深度学习缩放规律的启发，研究预测不确定性是否也存在类似的规律，以解决过参数化模型中不确定性行为的未知问题。

Method: 通过实验在视觉和语言任务中，使用近似贝叶斯推理和集成方法测量预测不确定性，并观察其与数据集和模型规模的关系。

Result: 实验证实了预测不确定性存在缩放规律，表明即使在大数据情况下，认知不确定性也不可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了缩放规律的优雅性，还为贝叶斯方法在深度学习中的实用性提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws,
demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on
dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena
emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do
similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In
identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a
straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this
case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic
uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in
over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely
unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of
scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with
respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language
tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive
uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and
ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical
utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work
provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian
approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data
available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data"
is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.

*Vahan Arsenyan,Elen Vardanyan,Arnak Dalalyan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DDPMs对噪声评分估计具有鲁棒性，并在Wasserstein-2距离下展示了更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DDPMs在噪声评分估计下的鲁棒性及其收敛性能。

Method: 通过扩散过程和估计的评分函数映射布朗运动，分析噪声对DDPMs的影响。

Result: DDPMs对恒定方差噪声具有鲁棒性，收敛速度更快，且结果与高斯情况一致。

Conclusion: DDPMs在噪声环境下表现优异，收敛速度最优。

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to produce new random examples from an unknown
target distribution, given access to a finite collection of examples. Among the
leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct
such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an
estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence
that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We
then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit
two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to
noisy score estimates, and (ii) they achieve faster convergence rates than
previously known results. Furthermore, we observe that the obtained rates match
those known in the Gaussian case, implying their optimality.

### [357] [A Deep Generative Model for the Simulation of Discrete Karst Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09832)

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图生成模型（深度学习技术）的新方法，用于模拟离散喀斯特网络的复杂模式。通过结合图循环神经网络（GraphRNN）和图去噪扩散概率模型（G-DDPM），该方法能够生成具有真实性的喀斯特网络图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟喀斯特网络的复杂性是一个重大挑战，因为其涉及多种地质和水文地质过程的长期相互作用。传统方法难以捕捉其多样性和复杂性。

Method: 采用GraphRNN学习喀斯特网络的拓扑分布，并通过G-DDPM学习节点特征（如空间坐标）。两者结合生成具有统计特性的网络图。

Result: 通过几何和拓扑指标验证，生成的子图与实际数据子图具有高度一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为喀斯特网络的随机模拟提供了有效工具，可用于研究水流和物质传输等物理过程。

Abstract: The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge
due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various
geological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex
interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately
linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that
represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep
learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In
this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while
edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two
main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to
learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the
graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by
previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion
probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial
coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes
features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned
statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,
ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential
features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst
networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the
database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows
stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of
formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such
as flow and transport.

### [358] [Automatic Treatment Planning using Reinforcement Learning for High-dose-rate Prostate Brachytherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09805)
*Tonghe Wang,Yining Feng,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用强化学习（RL）在高剂量率（HDR）前列腺近距离放射治疗中自动生成针位和停留时间的可行性，结果显示RL方法在减少针数的情况下实现了与临床方法相当或更好的治疗效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前HDR前列腺近距离放射治疗的针位放置仅依赖医生经验，RL方法旨在减少手术时间并确保治疗计划的一致性。

Method: 训练一个RL代理，通过多轮调整针位和停留时间以最大化奖励函数，使用11例患者数据（1例训练，10例测试）进行验证。

Result: RL计划与临床计划在前列腺覆盖率和直肠剂量上相似，但在减少前列腺热点和尿道剂量上表现更优，且平均少用2根针。

Conclusion: RL方法首次证明可自主生成临床实用的HDR前列腺治疗计划，具有标准化治疗、减少临床变异性和改善患者效果的潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the
pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We
investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide
needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning
stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan
quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of
one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined
reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent
then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple
rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.
Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for
testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric
metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the
clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical
plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no
statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate
V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans
use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the
first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to
autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.
This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to
conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal
data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial
potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,
and enhance patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模课堂语音数据的稀缺阻碍了教育领域AI语音模型的发展，现有公开数据集有限且缺乏专用噪声库。

Method: 使用游戏引擎合成课堂噪声，结合公共儿童语音库和YouTube讲座视频生成模拟课堂语音数据。

Result: SimClass数据集在实验中表现出接近真实课堂语音的效果。

Conclusion: SimClass为开发鲁棒的语音识别和增强模型提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets
remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the
use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom
noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this
methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube
lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将上下文偏置（CB）方法与预训练的语音基础模型（OWSM v3.1）结合的方法，通过冻结预训练参数，有效提升了罕见词识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音基础模型（SFMs）在罕见词识别上表现不佳，而现有的上下文偏置方法因缺乏预训练知识性能较低。

Method: 将现有CB方法与OWSM v3.1结合，冻结预训练参数，利用SFMs的嵌入知识。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在LibriSpeech 100测试集上，B-WER提升了11.6点，整体WER提升0.9点，实时因子降低7.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法在保留SFMs优势的同时，通过小数据集实现了有效的上下文偏置。

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

Conclusion: BemaGANv2在音频生成中表现出色，提供了详细的教程和开源代码以促进复现。

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a
comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and
implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are

Motivation: 人类利用语言知识（如语法和语义）辅助语音感知，启发研究者探索PSLMs和PLMs在AV-TSE中的潜力。

Method: 将PSLMs或PLMs的语言约束作为额外监督信号引入AV-TSE模型，无需增加推理时的计算成本。

Result: 该方法显著提升了语音质量和可懂度，在多语言和视觉线索受损场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用语言模型作为辅助知识源可以有效提升AV-TSE模型的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on
target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know
that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to
support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of
pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models
(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose
incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE
model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra
computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently
improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show
robust performance gains.

Result: UmbraTTS显著优于现有基线，生成自然、高质量且环境感知的音频。

Conclusion: UmbraTTS为复杂环境下的语音合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech
synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains
challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that
jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and
acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume
and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge
is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural
context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a
self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and
transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural,
high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various
domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey
comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X
communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep
Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and
Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past

emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence
of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent
research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to
address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent
resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security
management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including
computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making
constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X
development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers,
engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered
