### [1] [Optimism, Expectation, or Sarcasm? Multi-Class Hope Speech Detection in Spanish and English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17974)
*Sabur Butt,Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi,Ahmad Imam Amjad,Maaz Amjad,Hector G. Ceballos,Salud Maria Jimenez-Zafra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了PolyHope V2数据集，用于多语言细粒度希望语音检测，并比较了预训练Transformer模型与大型语言模型在零样本和少样本下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望是一种复杂且未被充分探索的情绪状态，对教育、心理健康和社交互动有重要影响，但其在自然语言处理中的检测具有挑战性。

Method: 研究构建了包含30,000多条标注推文的多语言数据集，区分四种希望子类型，并比较了预训练Transformer模型与LLMs（如GPT-4和Llama 3）的表现。

Result: 微调的Transformer模型在区分细微希望类别和讽刺方面优于基于提示的LLMs。

Conclusion: 该数据集和结果为未来需要更高语义和上下文敏感性的跨语言情感识别任务提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant
role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic
emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to
exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language
Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a
multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated
tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope
subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances
existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark
multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes.
Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs,
especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through
qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges
in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a
robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater
semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.

### [2] [Improving LLM Personas via Rationalization with Psychological Scaffolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17993)
*Brihi Joshi,Xiang Ren,Swabha Swayamdipta,Rik Koncel-Kedziorski,Tim Paek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PB&J框架通过引入心理学支架（如大五人格理论）生成用户判断的理性解释，提升LLM人物模型的性能，优于仅基于人口统计或判断的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖用户人口统计或判断，无法捕捉其背后的推理逻辑，需改进。

Method: PB&J框架结合心理学理论生成用户判断的理性解释，如基于经验、人格特质或信仰。

Result: 在公共意见和电影偏好预测任务中，PB&J增强的LLM人物模型表现优于传统方法，且与人工撰写解释的模型竞争。

Conclusion: PB&J通过心理学支架生成理性解释，显著提升LLM人物模型的准确性和解释性。

Abstract: Language models prompted with a user description or persona can predict a
user's preferences and opinions, but existing approaches to building personas
-- based solely on a user's demographic attributes and/or prior judgments --
fail to capture the underlying reasoning behind said user judgments. We
introduce PB&J (Psychology of Behavior and Judgments), a framework that
improves LLM personas by incorporating rationales of why a user might make
specific judgments. These rationales are LLM-generated, and aim to reason about
a user's behavior on the basis of their experiences, personality traits or
beliefs. This is done using psychological scaffolds -- structured frameworks
grounded in theories such as the Big 5 Personality Traits and Primal World
Beliefs -- that help provide structure to the generated rationales. Experiments
on public opinion and movie preference prediction tasks demonstrate that LLM
personas augmented with PB&J rationales consistently outperform methods using
only a user's demographics and/or judgments. Additionally, LLM personas
constructed using scaffolds describing user beliefs perform competitively with
those using human-written rationales.

### [3] [Memory Reviving, Continuing Learning and Beyond: Evaluation of Pre-trained Encoders and Decoders for Multimodal Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18012)
*Zhuang Yu,Shiliang Sun,Jing Zhao,Tengfei Song,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了预训练编码器和解码器在多模态机器翻译中的作用，发现预训练解码器能显著提升翻译质量，而预训练编码器的效果则取决于视觉-文本对齐的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言和视觉模型在多模态机器翻译中的效果和作用，填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 在统一的多模态翻译框架下，比较不同训练策略（从零训练、预训练到部分冻结组件）对翻译性能的影响，实验基于Multi30K和CoMMuTE数据集。

Result: 预训练解码器能产生更流畅准确的翻译，而预训练编码器的效果因视觉-文本对齐质量而异。

Conclusion: 预训练在多模态翻译中起关键但不对称作用，为未来多模态翻译系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) aims to improve translation quality by
leveraging auxiliary modalities such as images alongside textual input. While
recent advances in large-scale pre-trained language and vision models have
significantly benefited unimodal natural language processing tasks, their
effectiveness and role in MMT remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct a
systematic study on the impact of pre-trained encoders and decoders in
multimodal translation models. Specifically, we analyze how different training
strategies, from training from scratch to using pre-trained and partially
frozen components, affect translation performance under a unified MMT
framework. Experiments are carried out on the Multi30K and CoMMuTE dataset
across English-German and English-French translation tasks. Our results reveal
that pre-training plays a crucial yet asymmetrical role in multimodal settings:
pre-trained decoders consistently yield more fluent and accurate outputs, while
pre-trained encoders show varied effects depending on the quality of
visual-text alignment. Furthermore, we provide insights into the interplay
between modality fusion and pre-trained components, offering guidance for
future architecture design in multimodal translation systems.

### [4] [RAG LLMs are Not Safer: A Safety Analysis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18041)
*Bang An,Shiyue Zhang,Mark Dredze*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现RAG框架可能降低LLMs的安全性，现有安全评估方法对RAG效果较差，需针对性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RAG框架对LLM安全性的影响，填补现有安全研究的空白。

Method: 对11种LLM进行RAG与非RAG框架的对比分析，评估安全性和现有红队方法效果。

Result: RAG可能降低模型安全性，安全模型与安全文档组合仍可能生成不安全内容，现有红队方法对RAG效果不佳。

Conclusion: 需开发专门针对RAG LLMs的安全研究和红队方法。

Abstract: Efforts to ensure the safety of large language models (LLMs) include safety
fine-tuning, evaluation, and red teaming. However, despite the widespread use
of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, AI safety work focuses
on standard LLMs, which means we know little about how RAG use cases change a
model's safety profile. We conduct a detailed comparative analysis of RAG and
non-RAG frameworks with eleven LLMs. We find that RAG can make models less safe
and change their safety profile. We explore the causes of this change and find
that even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe
generations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG
settings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG
settings. Our work highlights the need for safety research and red-teaming
methods specifically tailored for RAG LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出DREAM方法，通过多模态风险解耦和强化学习提升MLLMs的安全性，实验显示效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因结合视觉和文本数据而带来新的安全挑战，需系统性解耦风险。

Method: 提出DREAM方法，结合监督微调和迭代强化学习（RLAIF）增强安全性。

Result: DREAM显著提升安全性（SIUO评分提高16.17%），且不影响正常任务性能。

Conclusion: DREAM为MLLMs的安全对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) pose unique safety challenges due to
their integration of visual and textual data, thereby introducing new
dimensions of potential attacks and complex risk combinations. In this paper,
we begin with a detailed analysis aimed at disentangling risks through
step-by-step reasoning within multimodal inputs. We find that systematic
multimodal risk disentanglement substantially enhances the risk awareness of
MLLMs. Via leveraging the strong discriminative abilities of multimodal risk
disentanglement, we further introduce \textbf{DREAM}
(\textit{\textbf{D}isentangling \textbf{R}isks to \textbf{E}nhance Safety
\textbf{A}lignment in \textbf{M}LLMs}), a novel approach that enhances safety
alignment in MLLMs through supervised fine-tuning and iterative Reinforcement
Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF). Experimental results show that DREAM
significantly boosts safety during both inference and training phases without
compromising performance on normal tasks (namely oversafety), achieving a
16.17\% improvement in the SIUO safe\&effective score compared to GPT-4V. The
data and code are available at https://github.com/Kizna1ver/DREAM.

### [6] [Exploring Personality-Aware Interactions in Salesperson Dialogue Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18058)
*Sijia Cheng,Wen-Yu Chang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了MBTI定义的用户人格对销售对话代理交互质量的影响，发现交互动态、任务完成率和对话自然性存在显著模式，为构建更自适应系统提供了见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索用户人格（基于MBTI）如何影响销售对话代理的交互质量和性能，以提升系统的适应性和个性化能力。

Method: 通过大规模测试和分析，评估预训练代理在不同MBTI用户类型中的有效性、适应性和个性化能力。

Result: 揭示了交互动态、任务完成率和对话自然性的显著模式，表明对话代理可根据人格特质优化策略。

Conclusion: 研究为构建自适应销售对话系统提供了实用见解，并发布了跨领域用户模拟器，推动了个性化对话系统的发展。

Abstract: The integration of dialogue agents into the sales domain requires a deep
understanding of how these systems interact with users possessing diverse
personas. This study explores the influence of user personas, defined using the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), on the interaction quality and performance
of sales-oriented dialogue agents. Through large-scale testing and analysis, we
assess the pre-trained agent's effectiveness, adaptability, and personalization
capabilities across a wide range of MBTI-defined user types. Our findings
reveal significant patterns in interaction dynamics, task completion rates, and
dialogue naturalness, underscoring the future potential for dialogue agents to
refine their strategies to better align with varying personality traits. This
work not only provides actionable insights for building more adaptive and
user-centric conversational systems in the sales domain but also contributes
broadly to the field by releasing persona-defined user simulators. These
simulators, unconstrained by domain, offer valuable tools for future research
and demonstrate the potential for scaling personalized dialogue systems across
diverse applications.

### [7] [PropRAG: Guiding Retrieval with Beam Search over Proposition Paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18070)
*Jingjin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PropRAG是一种基于命题和路径搜索的RAG框架，通过高效图遍历和预计算嵌入提升检索效果，避免在线LLM推理成本，在多个数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RAG方法无法捕捉人类记忆的关联性和上下文理解能力，且结构化RAG方法（如HippoRAG）存在上下文丢失问题。

Method: PropRAG利用上下文丰富的命题和新型束搜索算法，通过图遍历和预计算嵌入实现多步推理链的显式发现。

Result: 在PopQA、2Wiki、HotpotQA和MuSiQue等数据集上取得零样本Recall@5和F1分数的最优结果。

Conclusion: PropRAG通过更丰富的表示和显式路径搜索，推动了非参数持续学习的进展。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard non-parametric
approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting common in continual learning. However,
standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the
interconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning
(associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured
RAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples,
the inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework
leveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm
over proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains.
Crucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without
invoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and
pre-computed embeddings. This avoids online LLM inference costs and potential
inconsistencies during evidence gathering. LLMs are used effectively offline
for high-quality proposition extraction and post-retrieval for answer
generation. PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 results on
PopQA (55.3%), 2Wiki (93.7%), HotpotQA (97.0%), and MuSiQue (77.3%), alongside
top F1 scores (e.g., 52.4% on MuSiQue). By improving evidence retrieval through
richer representation and explicit, LLM-free online path finding, PropRAG
advances non-parametric continual learning.

### [8] [Stabilizing Reasoning in Medical LLMs with Continued Pretraining and Reasoning Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18080)
*Wataru Kawakami,Keita Suzuki,Junichiro Iwasawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B模型，通过两阶段微调优化日本医学领域的准确性和推理稳定性，在IgakuQA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在医学领域应用中因事实准确性、语言限制和推理可靠性不足而导致的临床采用障碍。

Method: 采用两阶段微调：1）在日语医学语料库上继续预训练（CPT）；2）基于偏好的推理优化（RPO）以增强可靠推理路径生成。

Result: 在IgakuQA基准测试中达到0.868准确率，优于GPT-4o，且在要求解释时仍保持高准确性。

Conclusion: 优化可靠解释与准确性同等重要，模型权重已公开以促进可信LLMs研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in medicine, yet clinical
adoption is hindered by concerns over factual accuracy, language-specific
limitations (e.g., Japanese), and critically, their reliability when required
to generate reasoning explanations -- a prerequisite for trust. This paper
introduces Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B, a 72B-parameter model optimized for the
Japanese medical domain to achieve both high accuracy and stable reasoning. We
employ a two-stage fine-tuning process on the Qwen2.5-72B base model: first,
Continued Pretraining (CPT) on a comprehensive Japanese medical corpus instills
deep domain knowledge. Second, Reasoning Preference Optimization (RPO), a
preference-based method, enhances the generation of reliable reasoning pathways
while preserving high answer accuracy. Evaluations on the Japanese Medical
Licensing Exam benchmark (IgakuQA) show Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B achieves
state-of-the-art performance (0.868 accuracy), surpassing strong proprietary
models like GPT-4o (0.866). Crucially, unlike baseline or CPT-only models which
exhibit significant accuracy degradation (up to 11.5\% and 3.8\% respectively
on IgakuQA) when prompted for explanations, our model maintains its high
accuracy (0.868) under such conditions. This highlights RPO's effectiveness in
stabilizing reasoning generation. This work underscores the importance of
optimizing for reliable explanations alongside accuracy. We release the
Preferred-MedLLM-Qwen-72B model weights to foster research into trustworthy
LLMs for specialized, high-stakes applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RSLLM的新方法，用于量化大型语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的不确定性，通过预测有限随机集（置信函数）而非传统概率向量，并结合层次聚类方法提高效率。实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于标准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs生成文本的可信度问题，提出量化不确定性的需求，以改进模型输出的可靠性。

Method: 提出RSLLM方法，预测有限随机集（置信函数），并通过层次聚类提取关键子集以提高效率。

Result: 在CoQA和OBQA数据集上，RSLLM优于标准模型，能更准确回答问题并估计预测的不确定性。

Conclusion: RSLLM在量化不确定性和检测幻觉方面表现出潜力，为LLMs的可信度提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to produce very high-quality tests and
responses to our queries. But how much can we trust this generated text? In
this paper, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification in LLMs. We
propose a novel Random-Set Large Language Model (RSLLM) approach which predicts
finite random sets (belief functions) over the token space, rather than
probability vectors as in classical LLMs. In order to allow so efficiently, we
also present a methodology based on hierarchical clustering to extract and use
a budget of "focal" subsets of tokens upon which the belief prediction is
defined, rather than using all possible collections of tokens, making the
method scalable yet effective. RS-LLMs encode the epistemic uncertainty induced
in their generation process by the size and diversity of its training set via
the size of the credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions. The
proposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b,
Mistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in
both datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in
estimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the
capability to detect when its hallucinating.

### [10] [Application and Optimization of Large Models Based on Prompt Tuning for Fact-Check-Worthiness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18104)
*Yinglong Yu,Hao Shen,Zhengyi Lyu,Qi He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示调整的事实核查价值估计分类方法，通过设计提示模板和大语言模型结合，提升了对有限或无标签数据下事实核查价值的判断准确性。实验表明，该方法在F1分数和准确率等指标上优于或匹配BERT、GPT-3.5和GPT-4等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球化和信息化背景下，虚假信息问题日益严重，需要高效的事实核查价值估计方法。

Method: 基于提示调整技术，设计提示模板并结合大语言模型，实现上下文学习，提升事实核查价值估计的准确性。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法在F1分数和准确率等指标上优于或匹配BERT、GPT-3.5和GPT-4等基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在事实核查价值估计任务中表现出有效性和先进性，尤其在处理有限或无标签数据时具有优势。

Abstract: In response to the growing problem of misinformation in the context of
globalization and informatization, this paper proposes a classification method
for fact-check-worthiness estimation based on prompt tuning. We construct a
model for fact-check-worthiness estimation at the methodological level using
prompt tuning. By applying designed prompt templates to large language models,
we establish in-context learning and leverage prompt tuning technology to
improve the accuracy of determining whether claims have fact-check-worthiness,
particularly when dealing with limited or unlabeled data. Through extensive
experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
surpasses or matches multiple baseline methods in the classification task of
fact-check-worthiness estimation assessment, including classical pre-trained
models such as BERT, as well as recent popular large models like GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4. Experiments show that the prompt tuning-based method proposed in this
study exhibits certain advantages in evaluation metrics such as F1 score and
accuracy, thereby effectively validating its effectiveness and advancement in
the task of fact-check-worthiness estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时的差异，揭示不同文化背景下的态度和话语特点。

Method: 使用主题建模、LLM提示工程和语料库短语学方法分析媒体报道内容。

Result: 中文媒体关注具体项目、体育精神、兴奋剂争议和新技术，英文媒体关注女运动员、奖牌和资格争议。中文报道在开幕式和体育精神上更积极，英文报道对女运动员积极但对开幕式反应和女子拳击争议消极。

Conclusion: 中英文媒体在报道巴黎奥运会时展现出明显的文化和态度差异，反映了不同的社会关注点和价值观。

Abstract: This study analyzes Chinese and English media reports on the Paris Olympics
using topic modeling, Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering, and corpus
phraseology methods to explore similarities and differences in discourse
construction and attitudinal meanings. Common topics include the opening
ceremony, athlete performance, and sponsorship brands. Chinese media focus on
specific sports, sports spirit, doping controversies, and new technologies,
while English media focus on female athletes, medal wins, and eligibility
controversies. Chinese reports show more frequent prepositional co-occurrences
and positive semantic prosody in describing the opening ceremony and sports
spirit. English reports exhibit positive semantic prosody when covering female
athletes but negative prosody in predicting opening ceremony reactions and
discussing women's boxing controversies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过大规模实证评估揭示了当前幻觉评估的不足，指出现有指标与人类判断不一致，并提出LLM（如GPT-4）评估效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型的幻觉问题阻碍其可靠性和广泛应用，但现有评估指标的鲁棒性和泛化能力尚未验证。

Method: 对6组幻觉检测指标、4个数据集、37个语言模型和5种解码方法进行大规模评估。

Result: 发现当前指标与人类判断不一致，LLM（如GPT-4）评估效果最佳，模式寻求解码方法可减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的评估指标和缓解策略以解决幻觉问题。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant obstacle to the reliability and widespread
adoption of language models, yet their accurate measurement remains a
persistent challenge. While many task- and domain-specific metrics have been
proposed to assess faithfulness and factuality concerns, the robustness and
generalization of these metrics are still untested. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale empirical evaluation of 6 diverse sets of hallucination detection
metrics across 4 datasets, 37 language models from 5 families, and 5 decoding
methods. Our extensive investigation reveals concerning gaps in current
hallucination evaluation: metrics often fail to align with human judgments,
take an overtly myopic view of the problem, and show inconsistent gains with
parameter scaling. Encouragingly, LLM-based evaluation, particularly with
GPT-4, yields the best overall results, and mode-seeking decoding methods seem
to reduce hallucinations, especially in knowledge-grounded settings. These
findings underscore the need for more robust metrics to understand and quantify
hallucinations, and better strategies to mitigate them.

*Tatsunori Tanaka,Fi Zheng,Kai Sato,Zhifeng Li,Yuanyun Zhang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的临床语言模型预训练目标，通过时间顺序的句子对训练模型，提升临床推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将电子健康记录视为静态文档，忽略了其时间演化和因果关系。

Method: 将EHR片段作为时间顺序的句子对，训练模型判断后续状态是否由先前状态蕴含、矛盾或中立。

Result: 在MIMIC IV上预训练，在时间临床QA、早期预警预测和疾病进展建模中取得最佳结果。

Conclusion: 通过时间结构化的预训练任务，模型能更好地泛化到预测和诊断任务。

Abstract: Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks
by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and
medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a
static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined
nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal
entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain.
Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and
trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by,
contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this
temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical
reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting
and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and
demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning
prediction, and disease progression modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文聚焦于乌尔都语教育领域的命名实体识别（NER），填补了该领域缺乏标注数据集的空白，提出了名为EDU-NER-2025的新数据集，并分析了乌尔都语的语言学挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语在特定领域（如教育）的NER研究不足，缺乏标注数据集，限制了模型识别学术角色、课程名称等实体的能力。

Method: 创建了手动标注的教育领域数据集EDU-NER-2025，详细描述了标注过程和指南，并分析了乌尔都语的语言学挑战。

Result: 提出了包含13个教育相关实体的EDU-NER-2025数据集，并探讨了乌尔都语文本中的形态复杂性和歧义问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为乌尔都语教育领域的NER提供了重要资源，并揭示了语言学挑战，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a pivotal role in various Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks by identifying and classifying named entities
(NEs) from unstructured data into predefined categories such as person,
organization, location, date, and time. While extensive research exists for
high-resource languages and general domains, NER in Urdu particularly within
domain-specific contexts like education remains significantly underexplored.
This is Due to lack of annotated datasets for educational content which limits
the ability of existing models to accurately identify entities such as academic
roles, course names, and institutional terms, underscoring the urgent need for
targeted resources in this domain. To the best of our knowledge, no dataset
exists in the domain of the Urdu language for this purpose. To achieve this
objective this study makes three key contributions. Firstly, we created a
manually annotated dataset in the education domain, named EDU-NER-2025, which
contains 13 unique most important entities related to education domain. Second,
we describe our annotation process and guidelines in detail and discuss the
challenges of labelling EDU-NER-2025 dataset. Third, we addressed and analyzed
key linguistic challenges, such as morphological complexity and ambiguity,
which are prevalent in formal Urdu texts.

*Þórir Hrafn Harðarson,Hrafn Loftsson,Stefán Ólafsson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨偏好训练技术（如RLHF和DPO）是否能提升冰岛法律摘要生成的质量，结果显示偏好训练提高了法律准确性，但对语言质量改善不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律领域语言模型的应用潜力大，但专业术语和正式风格带来挑战，需探索提升模型性能的方法。

Method: 比较偏好训练（RLHF和DPO）与传统监督学习在法律摘要生成中的表现。

Result: 偏好训练提高了法律准确性，但对冰岛语语言质量无显著改善；自动指标与人工评估存在差异。

Conclusion: 偏好训练在法律领域有效，但需结合定性评估以优化语言模型开发。

Abstract: The integration of language models in the legal domain holds considerable
promise for streamlining processes and improving efficiency in managing
extensive workloads. However, the specialized terminology, nuanced language,
and formal style of legal texts can present substantial challenges. This study
examines whether preference-based training techniques, specifically
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization,
can enhance models' performance in generating Icelandic legal summaries that
align with domain-specific language standards and user preferences. We compare
models fine-tuned with preference training to those using conventional
supervised learning. Results indicate that preference training improves the
legal accuracy of generated summaries over standard fine-tuning but does not
significantly enhance the overall quality of Icelandic language usage.
Discrepancies between automated metrics and human evaluations further
underscore the importance of qualitative assessment in developing language
models for the legal domain.

Motivation: 解决小型模型在RAG任务中性能不足的问题，同时支持多语言和引用功能。

Method: 基于大型合成数据集进行预训练，支持查询路由、查询重构和来源重排等功能。

Result: 在HotPotQA和2wiki等基准测试中优于4B参数以下的SLM，并与更大模型竞争。

Conclusion: 这些模型因其小尺寸和高事实性，为生成式AI开辟了新用例。

Abstract: We introduce a new generation of small reasoning models for RAG, search, and
source summarization. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B are mid-trained on a
large synthetic dataset emulating the retrieval of a wide variety of
multilingual open sources from the Common Corpus. They provide native support
for citation and grounding with literal quotes and reintegrate multiple
features associated with RAG workflows, such as query routing, query
reformulation, and source reranking. Pleias-RAG-350m and Pleias-RAG-1B
outperform SLMs below 4 billion parameters on standardized RAG benchmarks
(HotPotQA, 2wiki) and are competitive with popular larger models, including
Qwen-2.5-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Gemma-3-4B. They are the only SLMs to date
maintaining consistent RAG performance across leading European languages and
ensuring systematic reference grounding for statements. Due to their size and
ease of deployment on constrained infrastructure and higher factuality by
design, the models unlock a range of new use cases for generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多轮推理数据集中微调LLMs时，生成的推理令牌会被排除在后续输入之外，导致无法单次前向处理整个对话，影响效率。

Method: 采用响应令牌复制和自定义注意力掩码，确保适当的可见性约束。

Result: 显著减少了训练时间，实现了在多轮推理数据集上的高效微调。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多轮推理数据集微调中的效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models ( LLMs) to generate explicit reasoning before
they produce an answer has been shown to improve their performance across
various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, fine-tuning LLMs on
multi-turn reasoning datasets presents a unique challenge: LLMs must generate
reasoning tokens that are excluded from subsequent inputs to the LLM. This
discrepancy prevents us from processing an entire conversation in a single
forward pass-an optimization readily available when we fine-tune on a
multi-turn non-reasoning dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that
overcomes this limitation through response token duplication and a custom
attention mask that enforces appropriate visibility constraints. Our approach
significantly reduces the training time and allows efficient fine-tuning on
multi-turn reasoning datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型方法无法满足精神病学诊断协议的需求，自动化临床访谈可改善心理健康服务的可及性。

Method: MAGI通过四个智能体（导航、提问、判断和诊断）动态执行MINI访谈，结合临床逻辑和对话适应性。

Result: 在1002名真实参与者中测试，涵盖多种心理问题，MAGI在临床严谨性和解释性推理方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MAGI为LLM辅助心理健康评估提供了临床严谨、适应性强且可解释的新方法。

Abstract: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental
healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches
fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first
framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated
multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four
specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to
the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending
diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating
whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent
generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map
symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world
participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and
suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by
combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable
reasoning.

TL;DR: TextTIGER通过增强和总结实体描述提升图像生成性能，实验验证其优于仅使用标题的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像生成模型中实体知识记忆不足的问题，因实体数量庞大且持续涌现。

Method: 提出TextTIGER，利用LLM增强和总结实体描述，减少长输入对性能的影响。

Result: 在IS、FID和CLIPScore等指标上优于仅使用标题的提示，且总结的描述更丰富。

Conclusion: 通过增强和总结实体描述，显著提升图像生成能力。

Abstract: Generating images from prompts containing specific entities requires models
to retain as much entity-specific knowledge as possible. However, fully
memorizing such knowledge is impractical due to the vast number of entities and
their continuous emergence. To address this, we propose Text-based Intelligent
Generation with Entity prompt Refinement (TextTIGER), which augments knowledge
on entities included in the prompts and then summarizes the augmented
descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate performance
degradation from longer inputs. To evaluate our method, we introduce WiT-Cub
(WiT with Captions and Uncomplicated Background-explanations), a dataset
comprising captions, images, and an entity list. Experiments on four image
generation models and five LLMs show that TextTIGER improves image generation
performance in standard metrics (IS, FID, and CLIPScore) compared to
caption-only prompts. Additionally, multiple annotators' evaluation confirms
that the summarized descriptions are more informative, validating LLMs' ability
to generate concise yet rich descriptions. These findings demonstrate that
refining prompts with augmented and summarized entity-related descriptions
enhances image generation capabilities. The code and dataset will be available
upon acceptance.

Motivation: LLMs的幻觉问题（输出错误信息）是主要挑战之一，但现有方法缺乏对其有效性的深入分析和全面比较。

Method: 通过系统综述代表性文献，并引入一个严格的基准测试，评估了六种相关方法。

Result: 实证评估验证了综述的重要发现，并提出了未来方向和开放挑战。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门研究LLMs校准方法和相关指标的综述，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been transformative across many domains.
However, hallucination -- confidently outputting incorrect information --
remains one of the leading challenges for LLMs. This raises the question of how
to accurately assess and quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Extensive literature
on traditional models has explored Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) to measure
uncertainty and employed calibration techniques to address the misalignment
between uncertainty and accuracy. While some of these methods have been adapted
for LLMs, the literature lacks an in-depth analysis of their effectiveness and
does not offer a comprehensive benchmark to enable insightful comparison among
existing solutions. In this work, we fill this gap via a systematic survey of
representative prior works on UQ and calibration for LLMs and introduce a
rigorous benchmark. Using two widely used reliability datasets, we empirically
evaluate six related methods, which justify the significant findings of our
review. Finally, we provide outlooks for key future directions and outline open
challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first dedicated
study to review the calibration methods and relevant metrics for LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，Auto-SLURP对现有先进框架提出了显著挑战，表明可靠的多智能体个人助手仍需改进。

Conclusion: Auto-SLURP为评估多智能体框架提供了重要工具，相关代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-agent frameworks powered by large language models
(LLMs) have advanced rapidly. Despite this progress, there is still a notable
absence of benchmark datasets specifically tailored to evaluate their
performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce Auto-SLURP, a benchmark dataset
aimed at evaluating LLM-based multi-agent frameworks in the context of
intelligent personal assistants. Auto-SLURP extends the original SLURP dataset
-- initially developed for natural language understanding tasks -- by
relabeling the data and integrating simulated servers and external services.
This enhancement enables a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation pipeline,
covering language understanding, task execution, and response generation. Our
experiments demonstrate that Auto-SLURP presents a significant challenge for
current state-of-the-art frameworks, highlighting that truly reliable and
intelligent multi-agent personal assistants remain a work in progress. The
dataset and related code are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的方法（GRPO）用于NLI任务，通过Chain-of-Thought学习消除对标注数据的需求，并在大规模模型上验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLI系统依赖监督学习，数据存在偏差和局限性，影响泛化能力。

Method: 使用GRPO进行Chain-of-Thought学习，结合LoRA和QLoRA参数高效技术微调7B、14B和32B模型。

Result: 32B量化模型在11个对抗性数据集中7个表现最优，内存占用仅22GB。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建鲁棒的NLI系统提供了可扩展且实用的框架。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language
understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and
information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely
on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts
and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work,
we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the
need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more
challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language
models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating
strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B
AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11
adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our
replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust
reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a
scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without
sacrificing inference quality.

Motivation: Bohairic Coptic作为重要但资源匮乏的方言，需要更多研究资源。

Method: 构建并评估Bohairic Coptic语料库，进行跨方言解析实验。

Result: 揭示了Bohairic与Sahidic的独特差异。

Conclusion: Bohairic Coptic是一种与Sahidic相关但独特的方言。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in digital resources for other Coptic dialects,
especially Sahidic, Bohairic Coptic, the main Coptic dialect for pre-Mamluk,
late Byzantine Egypt, and the contemporary language of the Coptic Church,
remains critically under-resourced. This paper presents and evaluates the first
syntactically annotated corpus of Bohairic Coptic, sampling data from a range
of works, including Biblical text, saints' lives and Christian ascetic writing.
We also explore some of the main differences we observe compared to the
existing UD treebank of Sahidic Coptic, the classical dialect of the language,
and conduct joint and cross-dialect parsing experiments, revealing the unique
nature of Bohairic as a related, but distinct variety from the more often
studied Sahidic.

TL;DR: HRScene是一个新的高分辨率图像（HRI）理解基准，包含25个真实数据集和2个合成诊断数据集，用于评估视觉大语言模型（VLMs）在HRI任务中的表现。实验显示当前VLMs在真实任务中平均准确率约50%，且难以有效利用HRI区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估VLMs在高分辨率图像理解能力的综合基准，HRScene填补了这一空白。

Method: HRScene整合了25个真实数据集和2个合成诊断数据集，覆盖多种场景，并由10名研究生重新标注。实验评估了28种VLMs。

Result: VLMs在真实任务中平均准确率约50%，在合成数据中表现出区域利用不足和“迷失中间”问题。

Conclusion: HRScene揭示了VLMs在HRI理解中的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: High-resolution image (HRI) understanding aims to process images with a large
number of pixels, such as pathological images and agricultural aerial images,
both of which can exceed 1 million pixels. Vision Large Language Models (VLMs)
can allegedly handle HRIs, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive
benchmark for VLMs to evaluate HRI understanding. To address this gap, we
introduce HRScene, a novel unified benchmark for HRI understanding with rich
scenes. HRScene incorporates 25 real-world datasets and 2 synthetic diagnostic
datasets with resolutions ranging from 1,024 $\times$ 1,024 to 35,503 $\times$
26,627. HRScene is collected and re-annotated by 10 graduate-level annotators,
covering 25 scenarios, ranging from microscopic to radiology images, street
views, long-range pictures, and telescope images. It includes HRIs of
real-world objects, scanned documents, and composite multi-image. The two
diagnostic evaluation datasets are synthesized by combining the target image
with the gold answer and distracting images in different orders, assessing how
well models utilize regions in HRI. We conduct extensive experiments involving
28 VLMs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o. Experiments on HRScene show
that current VLMs achieve an average accuracy of around 50% on real-world
tasks, revealing significant gaps in HRI understanding. Results on synthetic
datasets reveal that VLMs struggle to effectively utilize HRI regions, showing
significant Regional Divergence and lost-in-middle, shedding light on future
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了是否能用大语言模型（LLM）替代心理治疗师，发现LLM在治疗关系中存在缺陷，如表达对心理健康问题的偏见和不恰当回应，结论是LLM不应替代治疗师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM替代心理治疗师的可行性，因科技初创公司和研究领域对此有推广。

Method: 通过分析主要医疗机构的治疗指南，评估LLM在治疗关系中的表现，并进行实验测试LLM（如GPT-4）的回应。

Result: LLM表现出对心理健康问题的偏见，且在自然治疗场景中回应不当（如鼓励妄想思维），现有安全措施未能解决这些问题。

Conclusion: LLM不应替代治疗师，但可探讨其在临床治疗中的其他辅助角色。

Abstract: Should a large language model (LLM) be used as a therapist? In this paper, we
investigate the use of LLMs to *replace* mental health providers, a use case
promoted in the tech startup and research space. We conduct a mapping review of
therapy guides used by major medical institutions to identify crucial aspects
of therapeutic relationships, such as the importance of a therapeutic alliance
between therapist and client. We then assess the ability of LLMs to reproduce
and adhere to these aspects of therapeutic relationships by conducting several
experiments investigating the responses of current LLMs, such as `gpt-4o`.
Contrary to best practices in the medical community, LLMs 1) express stigma
toward those with mental health conditions and 2) respond inappropriately to
certain common (and critical) conditions in naturalistic therapy settings --
e.g., LLMs encourage clients' delusional thinking, likely due to their
sycophancy. This occurs even with larger and newer LLMs, indicating that
current safety practices may not address these gaps. Furthermore, we note
foundational and practical barriers to the adoption of LLMs as therapists, such
as that a therapeutic alliance requires human characteristics (e.g., identity
and stakes). For these reasons, we conclude that LLMs should not replace
therapists, and we discuss alternative roles for LLMs in clinical therapy.

Motivation: 1-bit LLMs的激活异常值问题阻碍了低比特量化，需要一种新方法来解决。

Method: 提出H-BitLinear模块，应用在线Hadamard变换平滑激活分布，使其更适合低比特表示。

Result: BitNet v2在4-bit激活量化下性能损失极小，显著减少内存和计算开销。

Conclusion: BitNet v2为1-bit LLMs的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by
activation outliers, which complicate quantization to low bit-widths. We
introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation
quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward
network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online
Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation
smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable
for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch
with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2
achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit
activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for
batched inference.

Method: 开发了PolyMath基准测试，涵盖18种语言和4个难度级别，并对高级LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: Deepseek-R1-671B和Qwen-QwQ-32B的得分仅为43.4和41.8，最高难度下准确率低于30%。研究发现LLMs在多语言推理中存在性能差异、输入输出语言一致性低等问题。

Conclusion: 控制输出语言可能影响推理性能，为提升LLMs的多语言能力提供了方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PolyMath, a multilingual mathematical reasoning
benchmark covering 18 languages and 4 easy-to-hard difficulty levels. Our
benchmark ensures difficulty comprehensiveness, language diversity, and
high-quality translation, making it a highly discriminative multilingual
mathematical benchmark in the era of reasoning LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation for advanced LLMs and find that even Deepseek-R1-671B and
Qwen-QwQ-32B, achieve only 43.4 and 41.8 benchmark scores, with less than 30%
accuracy under the highest level. From a language perspective, our benchmark
reveals several key challenges of LLMs in multilingual reasoning: (1) Reasoning
performance varies widely across languages for current LLMs; (2) Input-output
language consistency is low in reasoning LLMs and may be correlated with
performance; (3) The thinking length differs significantly by language for
current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that controlling the output language
in the instructions has the potential to affect reasoning performance,
especially for some low-resource languages, suggesting a promising direction
for improving multilingual capabilities in LLMs.

Result: 在七个推理基准测试中，FAST相对基础模型提升10%准确率，同时减少32.7-67.3%的token使用。

Conclusion: FAST有效平衡推理长度和准确性，为大型视觉语言模型提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have revealed an
\textit{overthinking} phenomenon, where models generate verbose reasoning
across all tasks regardless of questions. To address this issue, we present
\textbf{FAST}, a novel \textbf{Fa}st-\textbf{S}low \textbf{T}hinking framework
that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question characteristics.
Through empirical analysis, we establish the feasibility of fast-slow thinking
in LVLMs by investigating how response length and data distribution affect
performance. We develop FAST-GRPO with three components: model-based metrics
for question characterization, an adaptive thinking reward mechanism, and
difficulty-aware KL regularization. Experiments across seven reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that FAST achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with over
10\% relative improvement compared to the base model, while reducing token
usage by 32.7-67.3\% compared to previous slow-thinking approaches, effectively
balancing reasoning length and accuracy.

Conclusion: 该方法推动了对话理解和系统开发的SoTA，并解决了数据泄漏和评估指标与人工判断不一致的问题。

Abstract: In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, Slot Schema Induction (SSI) is
essential for automatically identifying key information slots from dialogue
data without manual intervention. This paper presents a novel state-of-the-art
(SoTA) approach that formulates SSI as a text generation task, where a language
model incrementally constructs and refines a slot schema over a stream of
dialogue data. To develop this approach, we present a fully automatic LLM-based
TOD simulation method that creates data with high-quality state labels for
novel task domains. Furthermore, we identify issues in SSI evaluation due to
data leakage and poor metric alignment with human judgment. We resolve these by
creating new evaluation data using our simulation method with human guidance
and correction, as well as designing improved evaluation metrics. These
contributions establish a foundation for future SSI research and advance the
SoTA in dialogue understanding and system development.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在共同构建解释对话中的能力，发现其能促进解释对象的参与和理解，但在动态调整解释方面仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于提升可解释人工智能（XAI）中解释的适应性，以满足解释对象的背景和需求。

Method: 通过用户研究，让解释对象与LLMs互动，评估其理解和感知LLMs的共同构建行为。

Result: 结果显示LLMs能展示部分共同构建行为（如验证问题），但动态调整解释的能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在共同构建解释对话中表现部分潜力，但仍需改进动态适应能力。

Abstract: The ability to generate explanations that are understood by explainees is the
quintessence of explainable artificial intelligence. Since understanding
depends on the explainee's background and needs, recent research has focused on
co-constructive explanation dialogues, where the explainer continuously
monitors the explainee's understanding and adapts explanations dynamically. We
investigate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage as explainers
in co-constructive explanation dialogues. In particular, we present a user
study in which explainees interact with LLMs, of which some have been
instructed to explain a predefined topic co-constructively. We evaluate the
explainees' understanding before and after the dialogue, as well as their
perception of the LLMs' co-constructive behavior. Our results indicate that
current LLMs show some co-constructive behaviors, such as asking verification
questions, that foster the explainees' engagement and can improve understanding
of a topic. However, their ability to effectively monitor the current
understanding and scaffold the explanations accordingly remains limited.

### [32] [TRACE Back from the Future: A Probabilistic Reasoning Approach to Controllable Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18535)
*Gwen Yidou Weng,Benjie Wang,Guy Van den Broeck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新框架，通过概率推理和轻量级控制，高效计算预期属性概率（EAP），实现语言模型输出的全局控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LMs）在输出控制上存在困难，现有方法昂贵、不灵活或不可靠。

Method: TRACE通过隐马尔可夫模型（HMM）和小型分类器估计属性概率，精确计算EAP并调整LM的下一词概率。

Result: TRACE在解毒任务中达到最优效果，仅增加10%解码开销，并能快速适应低资源个性化需求。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种高效、灵活且可扩展的语言模型控制方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to
control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or
desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive
models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that
require looking ahead. Existing solutions either tune or post-train LMs for
each new attribute - expensive and inflexible - or approximate the Expected
Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which
is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable
Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel
framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through
tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to
estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's
predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token
probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves
state-of-the-art results in detoxification with only 10% decoding overhead,
adapts to 76 low-resource personalized LLMs within seconds, and seamlessly
extends to composite attributes.

### [33] [Spectral Dictionary Learning for Generative Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17804)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频谱的生成模型，通过学习的频谱基函数重建图像，具有高解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型（如变分、对抗和扩散模型）依赖随机推理或对抗训练，缺乏解释性。新方法通过频谱表示提供更直观的物理意义。

Method: 将图像展平为一维信号，用参数化的频谱基函数（频率、相位、振幅）线性组合重建，并学习全局频谱字典和调制系数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上表现优异，重建质量和感知保真度与现有方法相当，且训练更稳定、计算更高效。

Conclusion: 该模型为可控合成提供了新途径，频谱字典增强了图像频率内容的直接操控能力，适用于图像处理和分析的新应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative model for image synthesis that departs
radically from the common variational, adversarial, and diffusion paradigms. In
our approach, images, after being flattened into one-dimensional signals, are
reconstructed as linear combinations of a set of learned spectral basis
functions, where each basis is explicitly parameterized in terms of frequency,
phase, and amplitude. The model jointly learns a global spectral dictionary
with time-varying modulations and per-image mixing coefficients that quantify
the contributions of each spectral component. Subsequently, a simple
probabilistic model is fitted to these mixing coefficients, enabling the
deterministic generation of new images by sampling from the latent space. This
framework leverages deterministic dictionary learning, offering a highly
interpretable and physically meaningful representation compared to methods
relying on stochastic inference or adversarial training. Moreover, the
incorporation of frequency-domain loss functions, computed via the short-time
Fourier transform (STFT), ensures that the synthesized images capture both
global structure and fine-grained spectral details, such as texture and edge
information. Experimental evaluations on the CIFAR-10 benchmark demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves competitive performance in terms of
reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity but also offers improved
training stability and computational efficiency. This new type of generative
model opens up promising avenues for controlled synthesis, as the learned
spectral dictionary affords a direct handle on the intrinsic frequency content
of the images, thus providing enhanced interpretability and potential for novel
applications in image manipulation and analysis.

### [34] [SmallGS: Gaussian Splatting-based Camera Pose Estimation for Small-Baseline Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17810)
*Yuxin Yao,Yan Zhang,Zhening Huang,Joan Lasenby*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SmallGS是一个针对小基线视频设计的相机姿态估计框架，利用高斯泼溅优化序列相机姿态，结合预训练视觉特征提升鲁棒性，在动态场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小基线视频在社交媒体中普遍存在，但现有姿态估计框架因特征模糊、漂移累积和三角测量约束不足而难以处理。

Method: SmallGS通过高斯泼溅重建场景，结合预训练视觉特征（如DINOv2），优化相机姿态，无需显式特征对应或强视差运动。

Result: 在TUM-Dynamics序列中，SmallGS在小基线视频的相机姿态估计上表现优异，优于MonST3R和DORID-SLAM。

Conclusion: SmallGS为小基线视频提供了一种高效、鲁棒的相机姿态估计解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life,
especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to
existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift
accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting,
which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable
novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this,
we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically
designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses
using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in
each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal
consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced
the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose
estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g.
DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering
enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian
splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features,
SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature
correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of
SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves
impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and
DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes. Our project page is at:

*Sara Sabour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了无监督神经网络的架构设计和训练方法，用于图像中目标分割，并扩展到3D应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究无监督目标分割方法，解决2D和3D场景中前景与背景区分问题，推动计算机视觉领域的发展。

Method: FlowCapsules利用运动线索进行2D目标分割；3D任务中利用几何一致性检测动态目标。

Result: 提出了无监督目标分割方法，并设计了优化内核以改进3D建模。

Conclusion: 展示了无监督目标方法的优势，并提出了未来研究方向，以激励社区进一步探索显式目标表示。

Abstract: In this thesis we discuss architectural designs and training methods for a
neural network to have the ability of dissecting an image into objects of
interest without supervision. The main challenge in 2D unsupervised object
segmentation is distinguishing between foreground objects of interest and
background. FlowCapsules uses motion as a cue for the objects of interest in 2D
scenarios. The last part of this thesis focuses on 3D applications where the
goal is detecting and removal of the object of interest from the input images.
In these tasks, we leverage the geometric consistency of scenes in 3D to detect
the inconsistent dynamic objects. Our transient object masks are then used for
designing robust optimization kernels to improve 3D modelling in a casual
capture setup. One of our goals in this thesis is to show the merits of
unsupervised object based approaches in computer vision. Furthermore, we
suggest possible directions for defining objects of interest or foreground
objects without requiring supervision. Our hope is to motivate and excite the
community into further exploring explicit object representations in image
understanding tasks.

*Dileepa Pitawela,Gustavo Carneiro,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLOC是一种新的基于边缘的对比学习方法，用于有序分类，通过优化多个边缘来学习有序表示，解决了现有方法未考虑不同类别边缘重要性差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有序分类中，相邻等级的误分类后果不同，但现有方法未考虑这种差异。例如，良性肿瘤分类错误的影响远小于癌前到癌变的分类错误。

Method: 提出CLOC方法，采用多边缘n对损失（MMNP），学习有序表示并灵活调整关键相邻类别的决策边界。

Result: 在五个真实图像数据集和一个合成数据集上，CLOC优于现有有序分类方法，并展示了其可解释性和可控性。

Conclusion: CLOC通过学习与临床需求一致的有序表示，提升了分类性能，并减少了训练数据中的偏差影响。

Abstract: In ordinal classification, misclassifying neighboring ranks is common, yet
the consequences of these errors are not the same. For example, misclassifying
benign tumor categories is less consequential, compared to an error at the
pre-cancerous to cancerous threshold, which could profoundly influence
treatment choices. Despite this, existing ordinal classification methods do not
account for the varying importance of these margins, treating all neighboring
classes as equally significant. To address this limitation, we propose CLOC, a
new margin-based contrastive learning method for ordinal classification that
learns an ordered representation based on the optimization of multiple margins
with a novel multi-margin n-pair loss (MMNP). CLOC enables flexible decision
boundaries across key adjacent categories, facilitating smooth transitions
between classes and reducing the risk of overfitting to biases present in the
training data. We provide empirical discussion regarding the properties of MMNP
and show experimental results on five real-world image datasets (Adience,
Historical Colour Image Dating, Knee Osteoarthritis, Indian Diabetic
Retinopathy Image, and Breast Carcinoma Subtyping) and one synthetic dataset
simulating clinical decision bias. Our results demonstrate that CLOC
outperforms existing ordinal classification methods and show the
interpretability and controllability of CLOC in learning meaningful, ordered
representations that align with clinical and practical needs.

*Mingxuan Cui,Qing Guo,Yuyi Wang,Hongkai Yu,Di Lin,Qin Zou,Ming-Ming Cheng,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的3D修复方法（3DGI），通过多视角的可见性不确定性引导和场景概念学习，实现了高质量的无缝修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D场景中掩蔽物体的修复问题，利用多视角的互补视觉和语义信息，克服单视角遮挡的挑战。

Method: 提出VISTA框架，结合可见性不确定性引导的3D修复和场景概念学习，使用扩散模型填充掩蔽物体。

Result: 在静态和动态场景中实现了高质量的无缝修复，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: VISTA框架在3D修复任务中表现出色，适用于多样化的场景重建需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful and efficient 3D
representation for novel view synthesis. This paper extends 3DGS capabilities
to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents
that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D
Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging
complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded
areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a
method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different
input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues.
We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the
masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images
based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA,
by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl
learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing
artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach
extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes,
enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We
demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art
techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10
diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset
derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.

*Daneul Kim,Jingxu Zhang,Wonjoon Jin,Sunghyun Cho,Qi Dai,Jaesik Park,Chong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种零样本训练方法，通过解耦主题学习和时间动态，无需额外调优即可生成定制化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频定制方法依赖大量标注视频数据，计算成本高且需大量标注。本文旨在通过图像数据集直接训练视频模型，降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 将视频定制分解为两部分：(1) 通过图像定制数据集注入主题；(2) 通过图像到视频训练方法保留时间动态。采用随机图像标记丢弃和初始化，并引入随机切换优化。

Result: 在零样本设置下，模型表现出强主题一致性和扩展性，优于现有视频定制方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统方法的计算和标注问题，展示了框架的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model
through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in
zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video
customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video
datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation.
In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image
customization dataset directly on training video customization models,
factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection
through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with
a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method.
Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image
initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste
issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during
joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and
scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot
settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下资产自主检测中，水质条件（如浊度和反向散射）严重影响能见度和机器人操作，传统方法存在机动和设置限制。

Method: 使用MLP预测图像质量，生成包含十种水质类型的合成数据集，并改进Blender软件以模拟水下光传播特性。

Result: 在仿真中验证了方法的有效性，视觉覆盖和图像质量显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，适用于广泛水质条件，代码已开源。

Abstract: When employing underwater vehicles for the autonomous inspection of assets,
it is crucial to consider and assess the water conditions. Indeed, they have a
significant impact on the visibility, which also affects robotic operations.
Turbidity can jeopardise the whole mission as it may prevent correct visual
documentation of the inspected structures. Previous works have introduced
methods to adapt to turbidity and backscattering, however, they also include
manoeuvring and setup constraints. We propose a simple yet efficient approach
to enable high-quality image acquisition of assets in a broad range of water
conditions. This active perception framework includes a multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) trained to predict image quality given a distance to a target and
artificial light intensity. We generated a large synthetic dataset including
ten water types with different levels of turbidity and backscattering. For
this, we modified the modelling software Blender to better account for the
underwater light propagation properties. We validated the approach in
simulation and showed significant improvements in visual coverage and quality
of imagery compared to traditional approaches. The project code is available on
our project page at https://roboticimaging.org/Projects/ActiveUW/.

TL;DR: VideoVista-CulturalLingo是一个跨文化、多语言、多领域的视频理解评估基准，填补了现有基准的不足，并揭示了当前视频大模型在文化多样性、时间理解和特定领域表现上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估基准多局限于单一语言（英语）和西方文化背景，缺乏文化多样性和多语言支持，因此需要一个新的基准来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出了VideoVista-CulturalLingo基准，包含1,389个视频和3,134个QA对，涵盖中国、北美和欧洲文化，支持中英双语，并评估了24个视频大模型。

Result: 实验发现：1）现有模型对中国文化相关问题的表现较差；2）开源模型在时间理解任务中表现不佳；3）主流模型在科学问题上表现良好，而开源模型在数学上较弱。

Conclusion: VideoVista-CulturalLingo为视频理解评估提供了更全面的基准，揭示了模型在跨文化和多语言任务中的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Assessing the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal AI systems can
effectively measure their understanding and reasoning abilities. Most video
evaluation benchmarks are limited to a single language, typically English, and
predominantly feature videos rooted in Western cultural contexts. In this
paper, we present VideoVista-CulturalLingo, the first video evaluation
benchmark designed to bridge cultural, linguistic, and domain divide in video
comprehension. Our work differs from existing benchmarks in the following ways:
1) Cultural diversity, incorporating cultures from China, North America, and
Europe; 2) Multi-linguistics, with questions presented in Chinese and
English-two of the most widely spoken languages; and 3) Broad domain, featuring
videos sourced from hundreds of human-created domains. VideoVista-CulturalLingo
contains 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, and we have evaluated 24 recent
open-source or proprietary video large models. From the experiment results, we
observe that: 1) Existing models perform worse on Chinese-centric questions
than Western-centric ones, particularly those related to Chinese history; 2)
Current open-source models still exhibit limitations in temporal understanding,
especially in the Event Localization task, achieving a maximum score of only
45.2%; 3) Mainstream models demonstrate strong performance in general
scientific questions, while open-source models demonstrate weak performance in
mathematics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的多模态融合方法，用于精确检测北极地区的Retrogressive Thaw Slumps（RTS），解决了小尺度、模糊边界和时空变化带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTS是北极地区重要的冻土融化标志，但其小尺度和模糊边界使其难以准确检测，需要高效的多模态数据利用方法。

Method: 采用Cascade Mask R-CNN模型，结合多尺度视觉Transformer骨干网络，并提出两种新策略：特征级残差跨模态注意力融合和预训练单模态学习后多模态微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在RTS检测中优于现有模型，为多模态数据的高效利用提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了RTS检测的准确性，还为冻土地貌及其环境影响的理解提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Retrogressive Thaw Slumps (RTS) in Arctic regions are distinct permafrost
landforms with significant environmental impacts. Mapping these RTS is crucial
because their appearance serves as a clear indication of permafrost thaw.
However, their small scale compared to other landform features, vague
boundaries, and spatiotemporal variation pose significant challenges for
accurate detection. In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning
model, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based
backbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were
introduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive
performance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion
strategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to
capture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand
complex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal
learning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand
while achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated
that our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion,
feature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies,
providing valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data
for RTS mapping. This research contributes to our understanding of permafrost
landforms and their environmental implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于U-Net的潜在扩散模型在图像修复中表现有限，而扩散变换器（DiTs）因其更好的质量和可扩展性成为有潜力的替代方案。

Method: DPIR采用双分支结构：低质量图像条件分支和双提示控制分支，结合轻量级模块和全局-局部视觉提示。

Result: 实验结果表明，DPIR在图像修复中表现优异。

Conclusion: DPIR通过双提示机制有效提升图像修复质量，成为该领域的先进方法。

Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art image restoration methods mostly adopt latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones, yet still facing challenges in achieving
high-quality restoration due to their limited capabilities. Diffusion
transformers (DiTs), like SD3, are emerging as a promising alternative because
of their better quality with scalability. In this paper, we introduce DPIR
(Dual Prompting Image Restoration), a novel image restoration method that
effectivly extracts conditional information of low-quality images from multiple
perspectives. Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image
conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch
utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with
high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration,
textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics.
Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional
visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance. The extracted
global-local visual prompts as extra conditional control, alongside textual
prompts to form dual prompts, greatly enhance the quality of the restoration.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DPIR delivers superior image
restoration performance.

Result: Oscars模型在VEU-Bench上准确率提升28.3%，且能显著提升Vid-LLMs在通用视频理解任务中的表现。

Conclusion: VEU-Bench和Oscars模型为视频编辑理解任务提供了新的研究方向和工具。

Abstract: Widely shared videos on the internet are often edited. Recently, although
Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general
video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding
(VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce
VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark
that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from
intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types
and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that
focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19
fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To
enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline
integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments
with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs
face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than
random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars, a VEU expert model
fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing
open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves
performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate
that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs
on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3%
across nine reasoning tasks.

precision. However, the reliability of such structures has not been
sufficiently analyzed, which poses them to the risk of imperceptible
perturbations that can significantly hinder their performance. In this work, we
show that state-of-the-art image-to-image dehazing transformers are susceptible
to adversarial noise, with even 1 pixel change being able to decrease the PSNR
by as much as 2.8 dB. Next, we propose two lightweight fine-tuning strategies
aimed at increasing the robustness of pre-trained transformers. Our methods
results in comparable clean performance, while significantly increasing the
protection against adversarial data. We further present their applicability in
two remote sensing scenarios, showcasing their robust behavior for
out-of-distribution data. The source code for adversarial fine-tuning and
attack algorithms can be found at github.com/Vladimirescu/RobustDehazing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）的计算成本高昂，当前视觉编码器存在冗余和低效问题，需要更有效的编码方法。

Method: 采用视觉标记选择和合并方法，特别是聚类级标记聚合，并通过基准测试和定性分析验证其效果。

Result: 聚类级标记聚合在标记选择和合并方面优于现有方法，揭示了视觉编码器的冗余问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为高维数据的更有效编码和处理提供了初步探索，推动了可扩展和可持续的多模态系统发展。

Abstract: The exponential growth of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has driven
advancements in cross-modal reasoning but at significant computational costs.
In this work, we focus on visual language models. We highlight the redundancy
and inefficiency in current vision encoders, and seek to construct an adaptive
compression method for multimodal data. In this work, we characterize a panoply
of visual token selection and merging approaches through both benchmarking and
qualitative analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that simple cluster-level
token aggregation outperforms prior state-of-the-art works in token selection
and merging, including merging at the vision encoder level and attention-based
approaches. We underline the redundancy in current vision encoders, and shed
light on several puzzling trends regarding principles of visual token selection
through cross-modal attention visualizations. This work is a first effort
towards more effective encoding and processing of high-dimensional data, and
paves the way for more scalable and sustainable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在频域中通过修改DCT系数来生成对抗性图像的新方法，以保护图像免受恶意编辑，同时减少视觉伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的进步使得通过文本提示轻松编辑图像成为可能，但也带来了图像安全问题。现有防御方法在像素空间添加噪声容易被察觉且对JPEG压缩等净化技术不鲁棒。

Method: 通过在频域中修改DCT系数生成对抗性图像，利用JPEG流程实现有效保护。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少视觉伪影的同时，保持了编辑保护和抗净化技术的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 频域对抗扰动是一种有效的图像保护方法，优于现有像素空间方法。

Abstract: Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via
text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to
user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses
attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to
disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the
adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human
eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques
like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel
optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the
frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients
of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates
adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive
experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our
approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of
edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.

TL;DR: CAMU框架通过结合视觉-语言模型和参数高效微调，显著提升了对社交媒体模因中仇恨内容的检测性能，并在多个数据集上达到先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体模因结合了视觉和文本线索，文化背景复杂，传统方法难以有效检测其中的仇恨内容。

Method: CAMU利用大型视觉-语言模型生成描述性标题，通过标题评分网络突出仇恨相关内容，并对CLIP文本编码器进行参数高效微调。

Result: 在Hateful Memes数据集上，CAMU达到0.807的准确率和0.806的F1分数，同时在MultiOFF数据集上取得0.673的最佳F1分数。

Conclusion: CAMU框架高效且通用，强调了视觉基础和文本表示对可靠检测的重要性，模型将公开以供进一步研究。

Abstract: Social media memes are a challenging domain for hate detection because they
intertwine visual and textual cues into culturally nuanced messages. We
introduce a novel framework, CAMU, which leverages large vision-language models
to generate more descriptive captions, a caption-scoring neural network to
emphasise hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's
text encoder for an improved multimodal understanding of memes. Experiments on
publicly available hateful meme datasets show that simple projection layer
fine-tuning yields modest gains, whereas selectively tuning deeper text encoder
layers significantly boosts performance on all evaluation metrics. Moreover,
our approach attains high accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the Hateful
Memes dataset, at par with the existing SoTA framework while being much more
efficient, offering practical advantages in real-world scenarios that rely on
fixed decision thresholds. CAMU also achieves the best F1-score of 0.673 on the
MultiOFF dataset for offensive meme identification, demonstrating its
generalisability. Additional analyses on benign confounders reveal that robust
visual grounding and nuanced text representations are crucial for reliable hate
and offence detection. We will publicly release CAMU along with the resultant
models for further research.

hateful, or offensive content due to the nature of the task.

*H. Martin Gillis,Ming Hill,Paul Hollensen,Alan Fine,Thomas Trappenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在血液成分分析中，如何通过调整掩码比例和补丁大小优化MAE（掩码自编码器）的性能，并结合ViT和U-Net Transformer实现小目标的分割与分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血液成分检测中，小像素目标在相似背景中的识别是一个挑战。现有深度学习方法在域外图像上表现不佳，需探索自监督学习策略。

Method: 使用MAE学习ViT编码器表示，调整掩码比例和补丁大小，并将编码器权重应用于U-Net Transformer进行语义分割。

Result: 实验表明，较小的掩码比例和补丁大小能改善MAE的图像重建；预训练权重对小尺寸血液成分的分割效果更佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为小目标的分割与分类提供了一种高效策略。

Abstract: The hematology analytics used for detection and classification of small blood
components is a significant challenge. In particular, when objects exists as
small pixel-sized entities in a large context of similar objects. Deep learning
approaches using supervised models with pre-trained weights, such as residual
networks and vision transformers have demonstrated success for many
applications. Unfortunately, when applied to images outside the domain of
learned representations, these methods often result with less than acceptable
performance. A strategy to overcome this can be achieved by using
self-supervised models, where representations are learned and weights are then
applied for downstream applications. Recently, masked autoencoders have proven
to be effective to obtain representations that captures global context
information. By masking regions of an image and having the model learn to
reconstruct both the masked and non-masked regions, weights can be used for
various applications. However, if the sizes of the objects in images are less
than the size of the mask, the global context information is lost, making it
almost impossible to reconstruct the image. In this study, we investigated the
effect of mask ratios and patch sizes for blood components using a MAE to
obtain learned ViT encoder representations. We then applied the encoder weights
to train a U-Net Transformer for semantic segmentation to obtain both local and
global contextual information. Our experimental results demonstrates that both
smaller mask ratios and patch sizes improve the reconstruction of images using
a MAE. We also show the results of semantic segmentation with and without
pre-trained weights, where smaller-sized blood components benefited with
pre-training. Overall, our proposed method offers an efficient and effective
strategy for the segmentation and classification of small objects.

*Yabing Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Qingpei Guo,Zheng Qin,Sanping Zhou,Ming Yang,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架解决零样本组合图像检索中的三个关键挑战，通过视觉语义注入和软文本对齐增强表示，并在少量合成数据上优化文本编码器，取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于组合图像检索（CIR）数据标注成本高，零样本CIR成为有前景的替代方案。现有投影方法存在伪词表示不足、训练与推理阶段差异及依赖大规模合成数据的问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过视觉语义注入和软文本对齐增强图像到伪词的学习；第二阶段用少量合成数据优化文本编码器，结合伪词和修改文本提取组合语义。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实验，性能优于现有方法，且对合成数据质量要求低。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效解决了零样本CIR的关键挑战，显著提升了性能，且对数据需求低。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging multimodal task that
retrieves a target image based on a reference image and accompanying
modification text. Due to the high cost of annotating CIR triplet datasets,
zero-shot (ZS) CIR has gained traction as a promising alternative. Existing
studies mainly focus on projection-based methods, which map an image to a
single pseudo-word token. However, these methods face three critical
challenges: (1) insufficient pseudo-word token representation capacity, (2)
discrepancies between training and inference phases, and (3) reliance on
large-scale synthetic data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage
framework where the training is accomplished from mapping to composing. In the
first stage, we enhance image-to-pseudo-word token learning by introducing a
visual semantic injection module and a soft text alignment objective, enabling
the token to capture richer and fine-grained image information. In the second
stage, we optimize the text encoder using a small amount of synthetic triplet
data, enabling it to effectively extract compositional semantics by combining
pseudo-word tokens with modification text for accurate target image retrieval.
The strong visual-to-pseudo mapping established in the first stage provides a
solid foundation for the second stage, making our approach compatible with both
high- and low-quality synthetic data, and capable of achieving significant
performance gains with only a small amount of synthetic data. Extensive
experiments were conducted on three public datasets, achieving superior
performance compared to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSRNav通过建模目标与当前观测之间的空间关系，解决了传统ImageNav方法中语义特征方向信息不足和视角不一致的问题，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ImageNav方法中，语义特征缺乏准确的方向信息，且训练与应用时的视角不一致导致性能下降。

Method: RSRNav通过构建目标与当前观测之间的相关性，并利用细粒度互相关和方向感知相关性逐步优化这些关系，为策略网络提供导航指导。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的评估显示，RSRNav在导航性能上表现优越，尤其在“用户匹配目标”场景中。

Conclusion: RSRNav是一种简单有效的方法，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Recent image-goal navigation (ImageNav) methods learn a perception-action
policy by separately capturing semantic features of the goal and egocentric
images, then passing them to a policy network. However, challenges remain: (1)
Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information,
leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when
viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address
these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons
spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation
guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing
correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed
to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are
progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware
correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on
three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance,
particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for
real-world applications.

Method: 结合多尺度Tsallis熵和低层特征进行两次聚类，动态评分机制优化计算成本。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现20%-45%计算量减少，性能损失极小，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LVTP在计算成本与精度间取得平衡，尤其适用于复杂边缘区域。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic segmentation but demand
significant computation, posing challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Existing token pruning methods often overlook
fundamental visual data characteristics. This study introduces 'LVTP', a
progressive token pruning framework guided by multi-scale Tsallis entropy and
low-level visual features with twice clustering. It integrates high-level
semantics and basic visual attributes for precise segmentation. A novel dynamic
scoring mechanism using multi-scale Tsallis entropy weighting overcomes
limitations of traditional single-parameter entropy. The framework also
incorporates low-level feature analysis to preserve critical edge information
while optimizing computational cost. As a plug-and-play module, it requires no
architectural changes or additional training. Evaluations across multiple
datasets show 20%-45% computational reductions with negligible performance
loss, outperforming existing methods in balancing cost and accuracy, especially
in complex edge regions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦客户端定制适配器（FCA）框架，用于医学图像分割，解决分布式数据岛屿和客户端域异质性导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割在X射线图像中对计算机辅助诊断和病变定位有益，但现有方法依赖集中式学习，不适用于分布式数据岛屿的实际场景。联邦学习虽能提供分布式解决方案，但面临客户端域异质性（分布多样性和类别不平衡）导致的训练不稳定。

Method: 提出FCA框架，利用现成医学基础模型中的通用知识稳定联邦训练过程，并开发两种客户端定制联邦更新策略，自适应分解适配器为通用和个体组件，分别全局和独立更新参数组。

Result: 在三个大规模数据集上的实验表明，FCA框架在联邦医学分割中具有有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FCA框架通过稳定联邦训练和实现客户端定制模型，解决了医学图像分割中的分布式数据岛屿和域异质性问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation in X-ray images is beneficial for computer-aided
diagnosis and lesion localization. Existing methods mainly fall into a
centralized learning paradigm, which is inapplicable in the practical medical
scenario that only has access to distributed data islands. Federated Learning
has the potential to offer a distributed solution but struggles with heavy
training instability due to client-wise domain heterogeneity (including
distribution diversity and class imbalance). In this paper, we propose a novel
Federated Client-tailored Adapter (FCA) framework for medical image
segmentation, which achieves stable and client-tailored adaptive segmentation
without sharing sensitive local data. Specifically, the federated adapter stirs
universal knowledge in off-the-shelf medical foundation models to stabilize the
federated training process. In addition, we develop two client-tailored
federated updating strategies that adaptively decompose the adapter into common
and individual components, then globally and independently update the parameter
groups associated with common client-invariant and individual client-specific
units, respectively. They further stabilize the heterogeneous federated
learning process and realize optimal client-tailored instead of sub-optimal
global-compromised segmentation models. Extensive experiments on three
large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed FCA framework for federated medical segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖身份标签监督，难以充分提取高级语义信息，且未显式建模身体形状特征。

Method: 设计了BSTA模块提取身体形状信息并转换为文本表示，引入TVCR确保文本与视觉特征对齐，以及SRL机制结合多文本监督和分布一致性约束。

Result: 在SYSU-MM01和RegDB数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: BSaTa框架有效提升了VIReID性能，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VIReID) aims to match visible and
infrared pedestrian images, but the modality differences and the complexity of
identity features make it challenging. Existing methods rely solely on identity
label supervision, which makes it difficult to fully extract high-level
semantic information. Recently, vision-language pre-trained models have been
introduced to VIReID, enhancing semantic information modeling by generating
textual descriptions. However, such methods do not explicitly model body shape
features, which are crucial for cross-modal matching. To address this, we
propose an effective Body Shape-aware Textual Alignment (BSaTa) framework that
explicitly models and utilizes body shape information to improve VIReID
performance. Specifically, we design a Body Shape Textual Alignment (BSTA)
module that extracts body shape information using a human parsing model and
converts it into structured text representations via CLIP. We also design a
Text-Visual Consistency Regularizer (TVCR) to ensure alignment between body
shape textual representations and visual body shape features. Furthermore, we
introduce a Shape-aware Representation Learning (SRL) mechanism that combines
Multi-text Supervision and Distribution Consistency Constraints to guide the
visual encoder to learn modality-invariant and discriminative identity
features, thus enhancing modality invariance. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
datasets, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该系统通过结合LVLM和分割模型，显著提升了视障人士的环境感知能力。

Abstract: It is a challenging task for visually impaired people to perceive their
surrounding environment due to the complexity of the natural scenes. Their
personal and social activities are thus highly limited. This paper introduces a
Large Vision-Language Model(LVLM) based environment perception system which
helps them to better understand the surrounding environment, by capturing the
current scene they face with a wearable device, and then letting them retrieve
the analysis results through the device. The visually impaired people could
acquire a global description of the scene by long pressing the screen to
activate the LVLM output, retrieve the categories of the objects in the scene
resulting from a segmentation model by tapping or swiping the screen, and get a
detailed description of the objects they are interested in by double-tapping
the screen. To help visually impaired people more accurately perceive the
world, this paper proposes incorporating the segmentation result of the RGB
image as external knowledge into the input of LVLM to reduce the LVLM's
hallucination. Technical experiments on POPE, MME and LLaVA-QA90 show that the
system could provide a more accurate description of the scene compared to
Qwen-VL-Chat, exploratory experiments show that the system helps visually
impaired people to perceive the surrounding environment effectively.

Method: 提出PRSS方法，结合提示重新锚定（PR）和语义提示搜索（SS），改进分类器自由引导。

Result: 实验表明PRSS在不同隐私级别下均能优化隐私与实用性的权衡，达到新最优水平。

Conclusion: PRSS为扩散模型中的隐私与实用性权衡提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
creating images highly aligned with user prompts, yet their proclivity for
memorizing training set images has sparked concerns about the originality of
the generated images and privacy issues, potentially leading to legal
complications for both model owners and users, particularly when the memorized
images contain proprietary content. Although methods to mitigate these issues
have been suggested, enhancing privacy often results in a significant decrease
in the utility of the outputs, as indicated by text-alignment scores. To bridge
the research gap, we introduce a novel method, PRSS, which refines the
classifier-free guidance approach in diffusion models by integrating prompt
re-anchoring (PR) to improve privacy and incorporating semantic prompt search
(SS) to enhance utility. Extensive experiments across various privacy levels
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the privacy-utility
trade-off, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In the field of medical imaging, the advent of deep learning, especially the
application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has revolutionized the
analysis and interpretation of medical images. Nevertheless, deep learning
methods usually rely on large amounts of labeled data. In medical imaging
research, the acquisition of high-quality labels is both expensive and
difficult. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViT) and self-supervised
learning provides a pre-training strategy that utilizes abundant unlabeled
data, effectively alleviating the label acquisition challenge while broadening
the breadth of data utilization. However, ViT's high computational density and
substantial demand for computing power, coupled with the lack of localization
characteristics of its operations on image patches, limit its efficiency and
applicability in many application scenarios. In this study, we employ
nn-MobileNet, a lightweight CNN framework, to implement a BERT-style
self-supervised learning approach. We pre-train the network on the unlabeled
retinal fundus images from the UK Biobank to improve downstream application
performance. We validate the results of the pre-trained model on Alzheimer's
disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and various retinal diseases
identification. The results show that our approach can significantly improve
performance in the downstream tasks. In summary, this study combines the
benefits of CNNs with the capabilities of advanced self-supervised learning in
handling large-scale unlabeled data, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in the
presence of label scarcity.

Abstract: As extended reality (XR) is redefining how users interact with computing
devices, research in human action recognition is gaining prominence. Typically,
models deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their
default set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and
developers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new
action classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should
be able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this
process should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive
training data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual
action recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning.
While existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual
learning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to
extensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET
demonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight
backbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel
spatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to
apply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new
benchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU
RGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand
gesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive
benchmarks. Source code at

Motivation: 单目3D多目标跟踪在机器人学和计算机视觉中至关重要，但现有方法难以从2D视频流中挖掘3D时空关联。

Method: 1. HSSM：压缩多路径上下文跟踪线索，实现高效全局数据关联；2. FCOE：通过密集特征图改进重识别；3. VeloSSM：建模速度时间依赖以提升6-DoF姿态估计。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential
for advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a
significant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D
spatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present
three innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of
heterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State
Space Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses
contextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and
comprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a
global receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear
assignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We
propose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI
pooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus
improving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such
as varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation
through VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal
dependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations
of frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art
performance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best
by significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness
and efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks. The code and models are available at

Result: 在MEAD和HDTF数据集上表现优异，情感准确性超越现有方法，同时保持唇同步性能。

Conclusion: DICE-Talk能生成身份保留且情感丰富的肖像，适应未见身份，用户研究验证其优越性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip
synchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing
methods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving
speaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional
talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional
cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of
emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion,
and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a
disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues
through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic
Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion
conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture
inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based
feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that
enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through
latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets
demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches
in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance.
Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to
generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional
expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.

Conclusion: SGSASR有效解决了航天器图像超分辨率中的噪声问题，提升了图像质量。

Abstract: Spacecraft image super-resolution seeks to enhance low-resolution spacecraft
images into high-resolution ones. Although existing arbitrary-scale
super-resolution methods perform well on general images, they tend to overlook
the difference in features between the spacecraft core region and the large
black space background, introducing irrelevant noise. In this paper, we propose
a salient region-guided spacecraft image arbitrary-scale super-resolution
network (SGSASR), which uses features from the spacecraft core salient regions
to guide latent modulation and achieve arbitrary-scale super-resolution.
Specifically, we design a spacecraft core region recognition block (SCRRB) that
identifies the core salient regions in spacecraft images using a pre-trained
saliency detection model. Furthermore, we present an adaptive-weighted feature
fusion enhancement mechanism (AFFEM) to selectively aggregate the spacecraft
core region features with general image features by dynamic weight parameter to
enhance the response of the core salient regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed SGSASR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在VisDrone2019数据集上，MASF-YOLO-s相比YOLOv11-s在mAP@0.5和mAP@0.5:0.95上分别提升了4.6%和3.5%，且参数和计算成本更低。

Conclusion: MASF-YOLO在检测精度和模型效率上均具有显著优势，为无人机图像目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and computer
vision technologies, object detection from UAV perspectives has emerged as a
prominent research area. However, challenges for detection brought by the
extremely small proportion of target pixels, significant scale variations of
objects, and complex background information in UAV images have greatly limited
the practical applications of UAV. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel object detection network Multi-scale Context Aggregation and
Scale-adaptive Fusion YOLO (MASF-YOLO), which is developed based on YOLOv11.
Firstly, to tackle the difficulty of detecting small objects in UAV images, we
design a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation Module (MFAM), which significantly
improves the detection accuracy of small objects through parallel multi-scale
convolutions and feature fusion. Secondly, to mitigate the interference of
background noise, we propose an Improved Efficient Multi-scale Attention Module
(IEMA), which enhances the focus on target regions through feature grouping,
parallel sub-networks, and cross-spatial learning. Thirdly, we introduce a
Dimension-Aware Selective Integration Module (DASI), which further enhances
multi-scale feature fusion capabilities by adaptively weighting and fusing
low-dimensional features and high-dimensional features. Finally, we conducted
extensive performance evaluations of our proposed method on the VisDrone2019
dataset. Compared to YOLOv11-s, MASFYOLO-s achieves improvements of 4.6% in
mAP@0.5 and 3.5% in mAP@0.5:0.95 on the VisDrone2019 validation set.
Remarkably, MASF-YOLO-s outperforms YOLOv11-m while requiring only
approximately 60% of its parameters and 65% of its computational cost.
Furthermore, comparative experiments with state-of-the-art detectors confirm
that MASF-YOLO-s maintains a clear competitive advantage in both detection
accuracy and model efficiency.

Result: 代理任务显著缩小了与人工标注数据的性能差距。

Conclusion: 代理任务为细粒度理解提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained understanding of human actions and poses in videos is essential
for human-centric AI applications. In this work, we introduce ActionArt, a
fine-grained video-caption dataset designed to advance research in
human-centric multimodal understanding. Our dataset comprises thousands of
videos capturing a broad spectrum of human actions, human-object interactions,
and diverse scenarios, each accompanied by detailed annotations that
meticulously label every limb movement. We develop eight sub-tasks to evaluate
the fine-grained understanding capabilities of existing large multimodal models
across different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that, while current
large multimodal models perform commendably on various tasks, they often fall
short in achieving fine-grained understanding. We attribute this limitation to
the scarcity of meticulously annotated data, which is both costly and difficult
to scale manually. Since manual annotations are costly and hard to scale, we
propose proxy tasks to enhance the model perception ability in both spatial and
temporal dimensions. These proxy tasks are carefully crafted to be driven by
data automatically generated from existing MLLMs, thereby reducing the reliance
on costly manual labels. Experimental results show that the proposed proxy
tasks significantly narrow the gap toward the performance achieved with
manually annotated fine-grained data.

Result: 在标准视觉任务中，E-InMeMo表现优于现有方法，mIoU提升7.99（前景分割）和17.04（单目标检测）。

Conclusion: E-InMeMo是一种轻量且有效的视觉ICL优化策略。

Abstract: Large-scale models trained on extensive datasets have become the standard due
to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks. In-context learning
(ICL), widely used in natural language processing, leverages these models by
providing task-specific prompts without modifying their parameters. This
paradigm is increasingly being adapted for computer vision, where models
receive an input-output image pair, known as an in-context pair, alongside a
query image to illustrate the desired output. However, the success of visual
ICL largely hinges on the quality of these prompts. To address this, we propose
Enhanced Instruct Me More (E-InMeMo), a novel approach that incorporates
learnable perturbations into in-context pairs to optimize prompting. Through
extensive experiments on standard vision tasks, E-InMeMo demonstrates superior
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it improves mIoU
scores by 7.99 for foreground segmentation and by 17.04 for single object
detection when compared to the baseline without learnable prompts. These
results highlight E-InMeMo as a lightweight yet effective strategy for
enhancing visual ICL. Code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类算法存在信息利用不足、任务独立性假设、超参数调优依赖、学习终止需外部标签以及性能依赖后处理等问题。

Method: 采用层间自表达损失、子空间结构范数优化、多阶段顺序学习框架、相对误差自停止机制和固定系数保留策略。

Result: 在六种数据集上表现优于多数线性子空间聚类算法，并与最佳线性方法竞争。

Conclusion: 新方法在无需超参数调优和外部标签的情况下，显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering (DSC) algorithms face several challenges that hinder
their widespread adoption across variois application domains. First, clustering
quality is typically assessed using only the encoder's output layer,
disregarding valuable information present in the intermediate layers. Second,
most DSC approaches treat representation learning and subspace clustering as
independent tasks, limiting their effectiveness. Third, they assume the
availability of a held-out dataset for hyperparameter tuning, which is often
impractical in real-world scenarios. Fourth, learning termination is commonly
based on clustering error monitoring, requiring external labels. Finally, their
performance often depends on post-processing techniques that rely on labeled
data. To address this limitations, we introduce a novel single-view DSC
approach that: (i) minimizes a layer-wise self expression loss using a joint
representation matrix; (ii) optimizes a subspace-structured norm to enhance
clustering quality; (iii) employs a multi-stage sequential learning framework,
consisting of pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling the use of multiple
regularization terms without hyperparameter tuning; (iv) incorporates a
relative error-based self-stopping mechanism to terminate training without
labels; and (v) retains a fixed number of leading coefficients in the learned
representation matrix based on prior knowledge. We evaluate the proposed method
on six datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. The results show that
our method outperforms most linear SC algorithms with careffulyl tuned
hyperparameters while maintaining competitive performance with the best
performing linear appoaches.

Motivation: 解决UDA在现实应用中的表现问题，尤其是使用视觉基础模型（VFMs）时，UDA是否比仅源域微调更有优势。

Method: 评估了合成到真实和真实到真实的UDA用例，并研究了少量目标域标记数据的影响。

Result: UDA在合成数据场景中表现更好（提升从+8 mIoU到+2 mIoU），但在多样化真实数据场景中无显著优势。使用1/16标记数据时，UDA达到与全监督模型相同的性能（85 mIoU）。

Conclusion: UDA在合成数据场景中表现优异，但在真实数据场景中需谨慎使用。讨论了如何优化UDA以支持大规模自动驾驶。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can improve a perception model's
generalization to an unlabeled target domain starting from a labeled source
domain. UDA using Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with synthetic source data
can achieve generalization performance comparable to fully-supervised learning
with real target data. However, because VFMs have strong generalization from
their pre-training, more straightforward, source-only fine-tuning can also
perform well on the target. As data scenarios used in academic research are not
necessarily representative for real-world applications, it is currently unclear
(a) how UDA behaves with more representative and diverse data and (b) if
source-only fine-tuning of VFMs can perform equally well in these scenarios.
Our research aims to close these gaps and, similar to previous studies, we
focus on semantic segmentation as a representative perception task. We assess
UDA for synth-to-real and real-to-real use cases with different source and
target data combinations. We also investigate the effect of using a small
amount of labeled target data in UDA. We clarify that while these scenarios are
more realistic, they are not necessarily more challenging. Our results show
that, when using stronger synthetic source data, UDA's improvement over
source-only fine-tuning of VFMs reduces from +8 mIoU to +2 mIoU, and when using
more diverse real source data, UDA has no added value. However, UDA
generalization is always higher in all synthetic data scenarios than
source-only fine-tuning and, when including only 1/16 of Cityscapes labels,
synthetic UDA obtains the same state-of-the-art segmentation quality of 85 mIoU
as a fully-supervised model using all labels. Considering the mixed results, we
discuss how UDA can best support robust autonomous driving at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体图像能反映用户意图和兴趣，但传统计算机视觉任务难以捕捉隐含的视觉线索，且现有方法无法处理意图类别的视觉多样性。

Method: MCCL方法将意图识别分解为视觉线索组合，并整合多粒度特征，使用类别特定原型缓解数据不平衡，采用图卷积网络进行多标签分类。

Result: 在Intentonomy和MDID数据集上取得了最先进的性能，同时具备良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解人类复杂多样的表达形式提供了新思路。

Abstract: In an era where social media platforms abound, individuals frequently share
images that offer insights into their intents and interests, impacting
individual life quality and societal stability. Traditional computer vision
tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, focus on concrete
visual representations, while intent recognition relies more on implicit visual
clues. This poses challenges due to the wide variation and subjectivity of such
clues, compounded by the problem of intra-class variety in conveying abstract
concepts, e.g. "enjoy life". Existing methods seek to solve the problem by
manually designing representative features or building prototypes for each
class from global features. However, these methods still struggle to deal with
the large visual diversity of each intent category. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach named Multi-grained Compositional visual Clue Learning (MCCL)
to address these challenges for image intent recognition. Our method leverages
the systematic compositionality of human cognition by breaking down intent
recognition into visual clue composition and integrating multi-grained
features. We adopt class-specific prototypes to alleviate data imbalance. We
treat intent recognition as a multi-label classification problem, using a graph
convolutional network to infuse prior knowledge through label embedding
correlations. Demonstrated by a state-of-the-art performance on the Intentonomy
and MDID datasets, our approach advances the accuracy of existing methods while
also possessing good interpretability. Our work provides an attempt for future
explorations in understanding complex and miscellaneous forms of human
expression.

Conclusion: 该方法对铁路自动化有潜力，未来仍需改进。

Abstract: Railway systems, particularly in Germany, require high levels of automation
to address legacy infrastructure challenges and increase train traffic safely.
A key component of automation is robust long-range perception, essential for
early hazard detection, such as obstacles at level crossings or pedestrians on
tracks. Unlike automotive systems with braking distances of ~70 meters, trains
require perception ranges exceeding 1 km. This paper presents an
deep-learning-based approach for long-range 3D object detection tailored for
autonomous trains. The method relies solely on monocular images, inspired by
the Faraway-Frustum approach, and incorporates LiDAR data during training to
improve depth estimation. The proposed pipeline consists of four key modules:
(1) a modified YOLOv9 for 2.5D object detection, (2) a depth estimation
network, and (3-4) dedicated short- and long-range 3D detection heads.
Evaluations on the OSDaR23 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach in detecting objects up to 250 meters. Results highlight its potential
for railway automation and outline areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Generative AI has significantly changed industries by enabling text-driven
image generation, yet challenges remain in achieving high-resolution outputs
that align with fine-grained user preferences. Consequently, multi-round
interactions are necessary to ensure the generated images meet expectations.
Previous methods enhanced prompts via reward feedback but did not optimize over
a multi-round dialogue dataset. In this work, we present a Visual Co-Adaptation
(VCA) framework incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, leveraging a
well-trained reward model aligned with human preferences. Using a diverse
multi-turn dialogue dataset, our framework applies multiple reward functions,
such as diversity, consistency, and preference feedback, while fine-tuning the
diffusion model through LoRA, thus optimizing image generation based on user
input. We also construct multi-round dialogue datasets of prompts and image
pairs aligned with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly improving image
consistency and alignment with user intent. Our approach consistently surpasses
competing models in user satisfaction, especially in multi-turn dialogue

Abstract: LiDAR-based semantic segmentation is critical for autonomous trains,
requiring accurate predictions across varying distances. This paper introduces
two targeted data augmentation methods designed to improve segmentation
performance on the railway-specific OSDaR23 dataset. The person instance
pasting method enhances segmentation of pedestrians at distant ranges by
injecting realistic variations into the dataset. The track sparsification
method redistributes point density in LiDAR scans, improving track segmentation
at far distances with minimal impact on close-range accuracy. Both methods are
evaluated using a state-of-the-art 3D semantic segmentation network,
demonstrating significant improvements in distant-range performance while
maintaining robustness in close-range predictions. We establish the first 3D
semantic segmentation benchmark for OSDaR23, demonstrating the potential of
data-centric approaches to address railway-specific challenges in autonomous
train perception.

Abstract: Monocular 3D clothed human reconstruction aims to create a complete 3D avatar
from a single image. To tackle the human geometry lacking in one RGB image,
current methods typically resort to a preceding model for an explicit geometric
representation. For the reconstruction itself, focus is on modeling both it and
the input image. This routine is constrained by the preceding model, and
overlooks the integrity of the reconstruction task. To address this, this paper
introduces a novel paradigm that treats human reconstruction as a holistic
process, utilizing an end-to-end network for direct prediction from 2D image to
3D avatar, eliminating any explicit intermediate geometry display. Based on
this, we further propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of two
core components: the Anatomy Shaping Extraction module, which captures implicit
shape features taking into account the specialty of human anatomy, and the
Twins Negotiating Reconstruction U-Net, which enhances reconstruction through
feature interaction between two U-Nets of different modalities. Moreover, we
propose a Comic Data Augmentation strategy and construct 15k+ 3D human scans to
bolster model performance in more complex case input. Extensive experiments on
two test sets and many in-the-wild cases show the superiority of our method
over SOTA methods. Our demos can be found in :

Abstract: The field of monocular depth estimation is continually evolving with the
advent of numerous innovative models and extensions. However, research on
monocular depth estimation methods specifically for underwater scenes remains
limited, compounded by a scarcity of relevant data and methodological support.
This paper proposes a novel approach to address the existing challenges in
current monocular depth estimation methods for underwater environments. We
construct an economically efficient dataset suitable for underwater scenarios
by employing multi-view depth estimation to generate supervisory signals and
corresponding enhanced underwater images. we introduces a texture-depth fusion
module, designed according to the underwater optical imaging principles, which
aims to effectively exploit and integrate depth information from texture cues.
Experimental results on the FLSea dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of models in underwater
settings. This work offers a cost-effective solution for monocular underwater
depth estimation and holds considerable promise for practical applications.

Result: BiasBench数据集支持可重复性测试，强化学习方法实现了在线偏置调整。

Conclusion: BiasBench和强化学习方法为事件相机的偏置配置提供了实用工具和框架。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors that detect light changes
asynchronously for each pixel. They are increasingly used in fields like
computer vision and robotics because of several advantages over traditional
frame-based cameras, such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high
dynamic range. As with any camera, the output's quality depends on how well the
camera's settings, called biases for event-based cameras, are configured. While
frame-based cameras have advanced automatic configuration algorithms, there are
very few such tools for tuning these biases. A systematic testing framework
would require observing the same scene with different biases, which is tricky
since event cameras only generate events when there is movement. Event
simulators exist, but since biases heavily depend on the electrical circuit and
the pixel design, available simulators are not well suited for bias tuning. To
allow reproducibility, we present BiasBench, a novel event dataset containing
multiple scenes with settings sampled in a grid-like pattern. We present three
different scenes, each with a quality metric of the downstream application.
Additionally, we present a novel, RL-based method to facilitate online bias
adjustments.

Abstract: With the exacerbation of the biodiversity and climate crises, macroecological
pursuits such as global biodiversity mapping become more urgent. Remote sensing
offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the
scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently,
self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled
data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with
generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets
biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions
underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address
seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons
rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality
at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and
introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we
train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare
representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse
ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling
method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the
importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches
state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning
(multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and
model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research at

Abstract: Recent audio-visual generative models have made substantial progress in
generating images from audio. However, existing approaches focus on generating
images from single-class audio and fail to generate images from mixed audio. To
address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Generation and Separation model
(AV-GAS) for generating images from soundscapes (mixed audio containing
multiple classes). Our contribution is threefold: First, we propose a new
challenge in the audio-visual generation task, which is to generate an image
given a multi-class audio input, and we propose a method that solves this task
using an audio-visual separator. Second, we introduce a new audio-visual
separation task, which involves generating separate images for each class
present in a mixed audio input. Lastly, we propose new evaluation metrics for
the audio-visual generation task: Class Representation Score (CRS) and a
modified R@K. Our model is trained and evaluated on the VGGSound dataset. We
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving 7% higher CRS
and 4% higher R@2* in generating plausible images with mixed audio.

Abstract: This contribution explores the impact of synthetic training data usage and
the prediction of material wear and aging in the context of re-identification.
Different experimental setups and gallery set expanding strategies are tested,
analyzing their impact on performance over time for aging re-identification
subjects. Using a continuously updating gallery, we were able to increase our
mean Rank-1 accuracy by 24%, as material aging was taken into account step by
step. In addition, using models trained with 10% artificial training data,
Rank-1 accuracy could be increased by up to 13%, in comparison to a model
trained on only real-world data, significantly boosting generalized performance
on hold-out data. Finally, this work introduces a novel, open-source
re-identification dataset, pallet-block-2696. This dataset contains 2,696
images of Euro pallets, taken over a period of 4 months. During this time,
natural aging processes occurred and some of the pallets were damaged during
their usage. These wear and tear processes significantly changed the appearance
of the pallets, providing a dataset that can be used to generate synthetically
aged pallets or other wooden materials.

Abstract: To support the Low Altitude Economy (LAE), precise unmanned aerial vehicles

signals are unavailable. Vision-based methods offer a viable alternative but
face severe bandwidth, memory and processing constraints on lightweight UAVs.
Inspired by mammalian spatial cognition, we propose a task-oriented
communication framework, where UAVs equipped with multi-camera systems extract
compact multi-view features and offload localization tasks to edge servers. We
introduce the Orthogonally-constrained Variational Information Bottleneck
encoder (O-VIB), which incorporates automatic relevance determination (ARD) to
prune non-informative features while enforcing orthogonality to minimize
redundancy. This enables efficient and accurate localization with minimal
transmission cost. Extensive evaluation on a dedicated LAE UAV dataset shows
that O-VIB achieves high-precision localization under stringent bandwidth
budgets. Code and dataset will be made publicly available:

Conclusion: STP4D通过统一框架实现了高质量的文本到4D生成，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Text-to-4D generation is rapidly developing and widely applied in various
scenarios. However, existing methods often fail to incorporate adequate
spatio-temporal modeling and prompt alignment within a unified framework,
resulting in temporal inconsistencies, geometric distortions, or low-quality 4D
content that deviates from the provided texts. Therefore, we propose STP4D, a
novel approach that aims to integrate comprehensive spatio-temporal-prompt
consistency modeling for high-quality text-to-4D generation. Specifically,
STP4D employs three carefully designed modules: Time-varying Prompt Embedding,
Geometric Information Enhancement, and Temporal Extension Deformation, which
collaborate to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, STP4D is among the first
methods to exploit the Diffusion model to generate 4D Gaussians, combining the
fine-grained modeling capabilities and the real-time rendering process of 4DGS
with the rapid inference speed of the Diffusion model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STP4D excels in generating high-fidelity 4D content with
exceptional efficiency (approximately 4.6s per asset), surpassing existing
methods in both quality and speed.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在z轴误差和整体性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了3D车道检测的准确性，解决了IPM的局限性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is challenging due to the difficulty in capturing
depth information from single-camera images. A common strategy involves
transforming front-view (FV) images into bird's-eye-view (BEV) space through
inverse perspective mapping (IPM), facilitating lane detection using BEV
features. However, IPM's flat-ground assumption and loss of contextual
information lead to inaccuracies in reconstructing 3D information, especially
height. In this paper, we introduce a BEV-based framework to address these
limitations and improve 3D lane detection accuracy. Our approach incorporates a
Hierarchical Depth-Aware Head that provides multi-scale depth features,
mitigating the flat-ground assumption by enhancing spatial awareness across
varying depths. Additionally, we leverage Depth Prior Distillation to transfer
semantic depth knowledge from a teacher model, capturing richer structural and
contextual information for complex lane structures. To further refine lane
continuity and ensure smooth lane reconstruction, we introduce a Conditional
Random Field module that enforces spatial coherence in lane predictions.
Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of z-axis error and outperforms other methods in the field
in overall performance. The code is released at:

Motivation: AR/VR应用对实时全身姿态估计的需求增加，但现有方法在精度和推理速度之间难以平衡。

Method: 设计了SSD-Poser模型，采用状态空间注意力编码器和频率感知解码器，优化复杂运动姿态的实时重建。

Result: 在AMASS数据集上表现出卓越的准确性和计算效率，推理速度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSD-Poser在实时性和精度上取得了显著突破，适用于AR/VR中的全身姿态估计。

Abstract: The growing applications of AR/VR increase the demand for real-time full-body
pose estimation from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs). Although HMDs provide joint
signals from the head and hands, reconstructing a full-body pose remains
challenging due to the unconstrained lower body. Recent advancements often rely
on conventional neural networks and generative models to improve performance in
this task, such as Transformers and diffusion models. However, these approaches
struggle to strike a balance between achieving precise pose reconstruction and
maintaining fast inference speed. To overcome these challenges, a lightweight
and efficient model, SSD-Poser, is designed for robust full-body motion
estimation from sparse observations. SSD-Poser incorporates a well-designed
hybrid encoder, State Space Attention Encoders, to adapt the state space
duality to complex motion poses and enable real-time realistic pose
reconstruction. Moreover, a Frequency-Aware Decoder is introduced to mitigate
jitter caused by variable-frequency motion signals, remarkably enhancing the
motion smoothness. Comprehensive experiments on the AMASS dataset demonstrate
that SSD-Poser achieves exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency,
showing outstanding inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法使用固定损失权重，未考虑任务重要性和训练过程动态变化，限制了隐写算法的性能。

Method: TSCL分为两阶段：先验课程控制和损失动态控制。第一阶段分步优化嵌入、解码和抗分析能力；第二阶段通过损失下降动态调整任务权重。

Result: 在ALASKA2、VOC2012和ImageNet数据集上，TSCL显著提升了隐写质量、解码准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: TSCL通过动态调整损失权重，有效平衡多项任务，为深度学习图像隐写提供了更优的训练策略。

Abstract: For deep learning-based image steganography frameworks, in order to ensure
the invisibility and recoverability of the information embedding, the loss
function usually contains several losses such as embedding loss, recovery loss
and steganalysis loss. In previous research works, fixed loss weights are
usually chosen for training optimization, and this setting is not linked to the
importance of the steganography task itself and the training process. In this
paper, we propose a Two-stage Curriculum Learning loss scheduler (TSCL) for
balancing multinomial losses in deep learning image steganography algorithms.
TSCL consists of two phases: a priori curriculum control and loss dynamics
control. The first phase firstly focuses the model on learning the information
embedding of the original image by controlling the loss weights in the
multi-party adversarial training; secondly, it makes the model shift its
learning focus to improving the decoding accuracy; and finally, it makes the
model learn to generate a steganographic image that is resistant to
steganalysis. In the second stage, the learning speed of each training task is
evaluated by calculating the loss drop of the before and after iteration rounds
to balance the learning of each task. Experimental results on three large
public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed TSCL
strategy improves the quality of steganography, decoding accuracy and security.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了成员推断在视觉语言模型中的局限性，同时为未来可信数据审计提供了方向。

Abstract: With the surge of large language models (LLMs), Large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs)--which integrate vision encoders with LLMs for accurate visual
grounding--have shown great potential in tasks like generalist agents and
robotic control. However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped
images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations,
and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which
determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing
technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%).
In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current
MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member
images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further
analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on
optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in
realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and
non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions,
performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the
theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's
embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this
pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and
identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts,
and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible. Our study presents a
systematic view of the limits and opportunities of MI for VLMs, providing
guidance for future efforts in trustworthy data auditing.

Result: 在3D-AffordanceNet数据集上，原型模型性能与黑盒模型相当，同时提供可解释性。

Conclusion: 原型模型在需要信任和安全的人机交互场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Robotic agents need to understand how to interact with objects in their
environment, both autonomously and during human-robot interactions. Affordance
detection on 3D point clouds, which identifies object regions that allow
specific interactions, has traditionally relied on deep learning models like
PointNet++, DGCNN, or PointTransformerV3. However, these models operate as
black boxes, offering no insight into their decision-making processes.
Prototypical Learning methods, such as ProtoPNet, provide an interpretable
alternative to black-box models by employing a "this looks like that"
case-based reasoning approach. However, they have been primarily applied to
image-based tasks. In this work, we apply prototypical learning to models for
affordance detection on 3D point clouds. Experiments on the 3D-AffordanceNet
benchmark dataset show that prototypical models achieve competitive performance
with state-of-the-art black-box models and offer inherent interpretability.
This makes prototypical models a promising candidate for human-robot
interaction scenarios that require increased trust and safety.

eliminating barriers to arbitrary manipulation and editing, raising concerns

comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for inpainting detection, with
three key contributions: 1) High-quality inpainting samples generated by six
state-of-the-art inpainting models, 2) Diverse generation scenarios enabled by
four mask generation strategies with optional text guidance, and 3) Large-scale
coverage with 258,266 inpainted images with rich semantic diversity. Our
benchmark is constructed to emphasize intrinsic inconsistencies between
inpainted and authentic regions, rather than superficial semantic artifacts
such as object shapes. We establish a rigorous evaluation protocol using three
standard metrics to assess existing IMDL approaches. The dataset will be made
publicly available to facilitate future research in this area.

*Tiankai Hang,Jianmin Bao,Fangyun Wei,Dong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAR模型通过替换MAR的扩散头为轻量级快捷头，实现了高效连续空间图像生成，推理速度提升2.3倍，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MAR模型在连续空间图像生成中因迭代去噪过程导致推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出FAR模型，用轻量级快捷头替换MAR的扩散头，支持高效少步采样，并与因果Transformer无缝集成。

Result: FAR推理速度比MAR快2.3倍，同时保持竞争力的FID和IS分数。

Conclusion: FAR首次实现了高效自回归范式的高保真连续空间图像生成，填补了视觉自回归建模中质量与可扩展性的关键空白。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have demonstrated remarkable success in sequential data
generation, particularly in NLP, but their extension to continuous-domain image
generation presents significant challenges. Recent work, the masked
autoregressive model (MAR), bypasses quantization by modeling per-token
distributions in continuous spaces using a diffusion head but suffers from slow
inference due to the high computational cost of the iterative denoising
process. To address this, we propose the Fast AutoRegressive model (FAR), a
novel framework that replaces MAR's diffusion head with a lightweight shortcut
head, enabling efficient few-step sampling while preserving autoregressive
principles. Additionally, FAR seamlessly integrates with causal Transformers,
extending them from discrete to continuous token generation without requiring
architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that FAR achieves
$2.3\times$ faster inference than MAR while maintaining competitive FID and IS
scores. This work establishes the first efficient autoregressive paradigm for
high-fidelity continuous-space image generation, bridging the critical gap
between quality and scalability in visual autoregressive modeling.

TL;DR: UV-CoT是一种无需标注的无监督视觉链式推理框架，通过偏好优化提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注文本链式推理，忽视了视觉线索的利用，且依赖标注数据，难以泛化。

Method: 通过自动生成偏好数据（模型生成的边界框比较），结合目标模型和评估模型的协作训练。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优于现有方法，并在四个未见数据集上展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: UV-CoT通过模拟人类视觉推理，显著提升了空间推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning greatly improves the interpretability and
problem-solving abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
existing approaches are focused on text CoT, limiting their ability to leverage
visual cues. Visual CoT remains underexplored, and the only work is based on
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that relies on extensive labeled bounding-box data
and is hard to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce
Unsupervised Visual CoT (UV-CoT), a novel framework for image-level CoT
reasoning via preference optimization. UV-CoT performs preference comparisons
between model-generated bounding boxes (one is preferred and the other is
dis-preferred), eliminating the need for bounding-box annotations. We get such
preference data by introducing an automatic data generation pipeline. Given an
image, our target MLLM (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B) generates seed bounding boxes using
a template prompt and then answers the question using each bounded region as
input. An evaluator MLLM (e.g., OmniLLM-12B) ranks the responses, and these
rankings serve as supervision to train the target MLLM with UV-CoT by
minimizing negative log-likelihood losses. By emulating human
perception--identifying key regions and reasoning based on them--UV-CoT can
improve visual comprehension, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks where
textual descriptions alone fall short. Our experiments on six datasets
demonstrate the superiority of UV-CoT, compared to the state-of-the-art textual
and visual CoT methods. Our zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets shows the
strong generalization of UV-CoT. The code is available in
https://github.com/kesenzhao/UV-CoT.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中表现优异，尤其是行人和骑行者的检测效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法灵活且高效，可适配多种单模态检测器，显著提升多模态3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: We present a new way to detect 3D objects from multimodal inputs, leveraging
both LiDAR and RGB cameras in a hybrid late-cascade scheme, that combines an
RGB detection network and a 3D LiDAR detector. We exploit late fusion
principles to reduce LiDAR False Positives, matching LiDAR detections with RGB
ones by projecting the LiDAR bounding boxes on the image. We rely on cascade
fusion principles to recover LiDAR False Negatives leveraging epipolar
constraints and frustums generated by RGB detections of separate views. Our
solution can be plugged on top of any underlying single-modal detectors,
enabling a flexible training process that can take advantage of pre-trained
LiDAR and RGB detectors, or train the two branches separately. We evaluate our
results on the KITTI object detection benchmark, showing significant
performance improvements, especially for the detection of Pedestrians and
Cyclists.

TL;DR: LaRI是一种从单张图像推理未见几何的新方法，通过分层点图建模相机光线相交的多个表面，实现高效、完整的几何推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度估计仅限于可见表面，LaRI旨在解决这一问题，支持对象和场景级别的统一任务。

Method: LaRI使用分层点图建模光线相交的多个表面，并预测光线停止索引以识别有效像素和层。

Result: LaRI在对象级别仅用4%训练数据和17%参数达到可比性能，场景级别仅需一次前向推理。

Conclusion: LaRI是一种高效通用的几何推理方法，适用于对象和场景级别任务。

Abstract: We present layered ray intersections (LaRI), a new method for unseen geometry
reasoning from a single image. Unlike conventional depth estimation that is
limited to the visible surface, LaRI models multiple surfaces intersected by
the camera rays using layered point maps. Benefiting from the compact and
layered representation, LaRI enables complete, efficient, and view-aligned
geometric reasoning to unify object- and scene-level tasks. We further propose
to predict the ray stopping index, which identifies valid intersecting pixels
and layers from LaRI's output. We build a complete training data generation
pipeline for synthetic and real-world data, including 3D objects and scenes,
with necessary data cleaning steps and coordination between rendering engines.
As a generic method, LaRI's performance is validated in two scenarios: It
yields comparable object-level results to the recent large generative model
using 4% of its training data and 17% of its parameters. Meanwhile, it achieves
scene-level occluded geometry reasoning in only one feed-forward.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于事件相机的迭代运动分割方法，通过将事件分类为背景和前景，扩展了对比度最大化框架，显著提升了运动目标检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机能够捕捉场景变化，但需要将事件数据分类为不同运动以实现运动分割，这对目标检测等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种迭代运动分割方法，将事件分类为背景（主导运动假设）和前景（独立运动残差），扩展了对比度最大化框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在公开和自录数据集上成功分类事件簇，生成清晰的运动补偿边缘图像，运动目标检测准确率提升超过30%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了事件相机在复杂场景中的应用潜力，还为事件运动分割的理论发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Event cameras provide rich signals that are suitable for motion estimation
since they respond to changes in the scene. As any visual changes in the scene
produce event data, it is paramount to classify the data into different motions
(i.e., motion segmentation), which is useful for various tasks such as object
detection and visual servoing. We propose an iterative motion segmentation
method, by classifying events into background (e.g., dominant motion
hypothesis) and foreground (independent motion residuals), thus extending the
Contrast Maximization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method successfully classifies event clusters both for public and
self-recorded datasets, producing sharp, motion-compensated edge-like images.
The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on moving object
detection benchmarks with an improvement of over 30%, and demonstrates its
possibility of applying to more complex and noisy real-world scenes. We hope
this work broadens the sensitivity of Contrast Maximization with respect to
both motion parameters and input events, thus contributing to theoretical
advancements in event-based motion segmentation estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NoiseController方法，通过多级噪声分解、多帧噪声协作和联合去噪，提升视频生成的时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量视频生成对电影和自动驾驶等领域至关重要，但现有方法忽视全局时空信息，导致时空一致性不足。

Method: 采用多级噪声分解（场景级和个体级）、多帧噪声协作（时空协作矩阵）和联合去噪（并行U-Nets）。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NoiseController显著提升视频生成的时空一致性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: High-quality video generation is crucial for many fields, including the film
industry and autonomous driving. However, generating videos with spatiotemporal
consistencies remains challenging. Current methods typically utilize attention
mechanisms or modify noise to achieve consistent videos, neglecting global
spatiotemporal information that could help ensure spatial and temporal
consistency during video generation. In this paper, we propose the
NoiseController, consisting of Multi-Level Noise Decomposition, Multi-Frame
Noise Collaboration, and Joint Denoising, to enhance spatiotemporal
consistencies in video generation. In multi-level noise decomposition, we first
decompose initial noises into scene-level foreground/background noises,
capturing distinct motion properties to model multi-view foreground/background
variations. Furthermore, each scene-level noise is further decomposed into
individual-level shared and residual components. The shared noise preserves
consistency, while the residual component maintains diversity. In multi-frame
noise collaboration, we introduce an inter-view spatiotemporal collaboration
matrix and an intra-view impact collaboration matrix , which captures mutual
cross-view effects and historical cross-frame impacts to enhance video quality.
The joint denoising contains two parallel denoising U-Nets to remove each
scene-level noise, mutually enhancing video generation. We evaluate our
NoiseController on public datasets focusing on video generation and downstream
tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3D高斯泼溅）在处理视角依赖效应时表现不佳，RGS-DR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RGS-DR采用2D高斯面元表示法准确估计几何和表面法线，并通过可学习基元显式建模几何和材质属性。使用多级立方体mipmap近似环境光照积分，并通过球形mipmap方向编码的残差通道优化外观建模。

Result: 实验表明，RGS-DR在光泽物体的高质量重建和渲染方面表现优异，优于无法重新光照的最先进方法。

Conclusion: RGS-DR通过创新的表示和建模方法，实现了高质量的光泽物体重建和渲染，具有灵活的光照和编辑能力。

Abstract: We introduce RGS-DR, a novel inverse rendering method for reconstructing and
rendering glossy and reflective objects with support for flexible relighting
and scene editing. Unlike existing methods (e.g., NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting), which struggle with view-dependent effects, RGS-DR utilizes a 2D
Gaussian surfel representation to accurately estimate geometry and surface
normals, an essential property for high-quality inverse rendering. Our approach
explicitly models geometric and material properties through learnable
primitives rasterized into a deferred shading pipeline, effectively reducing
rendering artifacts and preserving sharp reflections. By employing a
multi-level cube mipmap, RGS-DR accurately approximates environment lighting
integrals, facilitating high-quality reconstruction and relighting. A residual
pass with spherical-mipmap-based directional encoding further refines the
appearance modeling. Experiments demonstrate that RGS-DR achieves high-quality
reconstruction and rendering quality for shiny objects, often outperforming
reconstruction-exclusive state-of-the-art methods incapable of relighting.

Motivation: 准确预测路面状况指数（PCI）对基础设施维护至关重要，但现有方法预测精度不足。

Method: 结合卷积块注意力模块（CBAM）的ResNet50模型，自主优先处理关键特征。

Conclusion: 注意力机制能优化特征提取，提升路面状况评估的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the Pavement Condition Index (PCI), a measure of
roadway conditions, from pavement images is crucial for infrastructure
maintenance. This study proposes an enhanced version of the Residual Network
(ResNet50) architecture, integrated with a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM), to predict PCI directly from pavement images without additional
annotations. By incorporating CBAM, the model autonomously prioritizes critical
features within the images, improving prediction accuracy. Compared to the
original baseline ResNet50 and DenseNet161 architectures, the enhanced
ResNet50-CBAM model achieved a significantly lower mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) of 58.16%, compared to the baseline models that achieved 70.76%
and 65.48% respectively. These results highlight the potential of using
attention mechanisms to refine feature extraction, ultimately enabling more
accurate and efficient assessments of pavement conditions. This study
emphasizes the importance of targeted feature refinement in advancing automated
pavement analysis through attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Eval3D揭示了当前3D生成模型的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Despite the unprecedented progress in the field of 3D generation, current
systems still often fail to produce high-quality 3D assets that are visually
appealing and geometrically and semantically consistent across multiple
viewpoints. To effectively assess the quality of the generated 3D data, there
is a need for a reliable 3D evaluation tool. Unfortunately, existing 3D
evaluation metrics often overlook the geometric quality of generated assets or
merely rely on black-box multimodal large language models for coarse
assessment. In this paper, we introduce Eval3D, a fine-grained, interpretable
evaluation tool that can faithfully evaluate the quality of generated 3D assets
based on various distinct yet complementary criteria. Our key observation is
that many desired properties of 3D generation, such as semantic and geometric
consistency, can be effectively captured by measuring the consistency among
various foundation models and tools. We thus leverage a diverse set of models
and tools as probes to evaluate the inconsistency of generated 3D assets across
different aspects. Compared to prior work, Eval3D provides pixel-wise
measurement, enables accurate 3D spatial feedback, and aligns more closely with
human judgments. We comprehensively evaluate existing 3D generation models
using Eval3D and highlight the limitations and challenges of current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模糊鲁棒性评估方法过于简化，无法反映真实光学系统的模糊效应。

Method: 通过Zernike多项式生成合成模糊数据集OpticsBench，并基于100个真实镜头数据构建LensCorruptions数据集。

Result: 实验表明，不同预训练模型在两类数据集上的性能差异显著。

Conclusion: 评估模型模糊鲁棒性需考虑真实光学模糊效应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be successful in various computer
vision applications such that models even infer in safety-critical situations.
Therefore, vision models have to behave in a robust way to disturbances such as
noise or blur. While seminal benchmarks exist to evaluate model robustness to
diverse corruptions, blur is often approximated in an overly simplistic way to
model defocus, while ignoring the different blur kernel shapes that result from
optical systems. To study model robustness against realistic optical blur
effects, this paper proposes two datasets of blur corruptions, which we denote
OpticsBench and LensCorruptions. OpticsBench examines primary aberrations such
as coma, defocus, and astigmatism, i.e. aberrations that can be represented by
varying a single parameter of Zernike polynomials. To go beyond the principled
but synthetic setting of primary aberrations, LensCorruptions samples linear
combinations in the vector space spanned by Zernike polynomials, corresponding
to 100 real lenses. Evaluations for image classification and object detection
on ImageNet and MSCOCO show that for a variety of different pre-trained models,
the performance on OpticsBench and LensCorruptions varies significantly,
indicating the need to consider realistic image corruptions to evaluate a
model's robustness against blur.

Result: 实验结果表明，基于事件的LED定位优于传统的基于帧的AR标记定位。

Conclusion: 该数据集和方法为事件相机在移动设备上的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Optical communication using modulated LEDs (e.g., visible light
communication) is an emerging application for event cameras, thanks to their
high spatio-temporal resolutions. Event cameras can be used simply to decode
the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker
positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and
localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our
knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame
camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware
triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in
different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we
propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization
framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and
experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with
events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the
efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed
dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer
vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to
broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices.

Motivation: 超分辨率问题存在多解性，传统方法倾向于生成模糊图像，而实际需求是高质量的图像。因此，研究如何利用NR-IQA模型来提升感知质量。

Method: 分析了NR-IQA指标在人类数据上的表现，并提出了两种应用方法：改变数据采样和直接优化可微分质量分数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在感知质量与失真之间取得了更好的平衡，更符合人类视觉偏好。

Conclusion: 利用NR-IQA模型可以更有效地优化超分辨率任务中的图像质量，减少对非感知像素失真的依赖。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR), a classical inverse problem in computer vision, is
inherently ill-posed, inducing a distribution of plausible solutions for every
input. However, the desired result is not simply the expectation of this
distribution, which is the blurry image obtained by minimizing pixelwise error,
but rather the sample with the highest image quality. A variety of techniques,
from perceptual metrics to adversarial losses, are employed to this end. In
this work, we explore an alternative: utilizing powerful non-reference image
quality assessment (NR-IQA) models in the SR context. We begin with a
comprehensive analysis of NR-IQA metrics on human-derived SR data, identifying
both the accuracy (human alignment) and complementarity of different metrics.
Then, we explore two methods of applying NR-IQA models to SR learning: (i)
altering data sampling, by building on an existing multi-ground-truth SR
framework, and (ii) directly optimizing a differentiable quality score. Our
results demonstrate a more human-centric perception-distortion tradeoff,
focusing less on non-perceptual pixel-wise distortion, instead improving the
balance between perceptual fidelity and human-tuned NR-IQA measures.

Motivation: 现有XAI硬件加速方法在实时场景中能效不足，限制了应用。

Result: XAIedge能效提升2倍，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: XAIedge有望推动可解释AI在能源受限实时应用中的部署。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enhances AI system transparency by
framing interpretability as an optimization problem. However, this approach
often necessitates numerous iterations of computationally intensive operations,
limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. While recent research has
focused on XAI hardware acceleration on FPGAs and TPU, these methods do not
fully address energy efficiency in real-time settings. To address this
limitation, we propose XAIedge, a novel framework that leverages approximate
computing techniques into XAI algorithms, including integrated gradients, model
distillation, and Shapley analysis. XAIedge translates these algorithms into
approximate matrix computations and exploits the synergy between convolution,
Fourier transform, and approximate computing paradigms. This approach enables
efficient hardware acceleration on TPU-based edge devices, facilitating faster
real-time outcome interpretations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates
that XAIedge achieves a $2\times$ improvement in energy efficiency compared to
existing accurate XAI hardware acceleration techniques while maintaining
comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of XAIedge to
significantly advance the deployment of explainable AI in energy-constrained
real-time applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现成本高、失败率高，且数据分散阻碍进展，需要一种能整合数据和专业知识的系统。

Method: PharmaSwarm利用多个LLM代理，每个代理专注于特定功能（如基因组分析、知识图谱等），并通过中央评估器LLM持续优化假设。

Result: 系统支持文献驱动发现、组学指导的靶点识别和药物再利用，并通过四层验证确保透明度和可重复性。

Conclusion: PharmaSwarm作为AI助手，能比传统流程更高效地提供高置信度假设，加速转化研究。

Abstract: Drug discovery remains a formidable challenge: more than 90 percent of
candidate molecules fail in clinical evaluation, and development costs often
exceed one billion dollars per approved therapy. Disparate data streams, from
genomics and transcriptomics to chemical libraries and clinical records, hinder
coherent mechanistic insight and slow progress. Meanwhile, large language
models excel at reasoning and tool integration but lack the modular
specialization and iterative memory required for regulated, hypothesis-driven
workflows. We introduce PharmaSwarm, a unified multi-agent framework that
orchestrates specialized LLM "agents" to propose, validate, and refine
hypotheses for novel drug targets and lead compounds. Each agent accesses
dedicated functionality--automated genomic and expression analysis; a curated
biomedical knowledge graph; pathway enrichment and network simulation;
interpretable binding affinity prediction--while a central Evaluator LLM
continuously ranks proposals by biological plausibility, novelty, in silico
efficacy, and safety. A shared memory layer captures validated insights and
fine-tunes underlying submodels over time, yielding a self-improving system.
Deployable on low-code platforms or Kubernetes-based microservices, PharmaSwarm
supports literature-driven discovery, omics-guided target identification, and
market-informed repurposing. We also describe a rigorous four-tier validation
pipeline spanning retrospective benchmarking, independent computational assays,
experimental testing, and expert user studies to ensure transparency,
reproducibility, and real-world impact. By acting as an AI copilot, PharmaSwarm
can accelerate translational research and deliver high-confidence hypotheses
more efficiently than traditional pipelines.

Conclusion: 差分隐私和联邦学习是保护医疗数据隐私的有效方法，同时支持高质量的机器学习分析。

Abstract: With the rapid digitalization of healthcare systems, there has been a
substantial increase in the generation and sharing of private health data.
Safeguarding patient information is essential for maintaining consumer trust
and ensuring compliance with legal data protection regulations. Machine
learning is critical in healthcare, supporting personalized treatment, early
disease detection, predictive analytics, image interpretation, drug discovery,
efficient operations, and patient monitoring. It enhances decision-making,
accelerates research, reduces errors, and improves patient outcomes. In this
paper, we utilize machine learning methodologies, including differential
privacy and federated learning, to develop privacy-preserving models that
enable healthcare stakeholders to extract insights without compromising
individual privacy. Differential privacy introduces noise to data to guarantee
statistical privacy, while federated learning enables collaborative model
training across decentralized datasets. We explore applying these technologies
to Heart Disease Data, demonstrating how they preserve privacy while delivering
valuable insights and comprehensive analysis. Our results show that using a
federated learning model with differential privacy achieved a test accuracy of

*Zheng Zhang,Nuoqian Xiao,Qi Chai,Deheng Ye,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiMind框架首次将多模态信息（如面部表情和语音语调）融入社交推理游戏代理，结合心理理论和蒙特卡洛树搜索，显著提升了代理在游戏中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交推理游戏代理仅依赖文本信息，忽略了人类自然使用的多模态线索（如面部表情和语调），且缺乏对其他玩家心理状态的建模。

Method: 使用One Night Ultimate Werewolf作为测试平台，MultiMind整合多模态信息（面部表情、语音语调）和心理理论模型，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索优化沟通策略。

Result: 在代理间模拟和人类玩家测试中，MultiMind表现出色，证明了其在游戏中的优越性能。

Conclusion: MultiMind为LLM代理在多模态社交推理领域实现类人能力迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and
social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to
textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial
expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate.
Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players'
identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players.
To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a
testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal
information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal
tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to
represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM
model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication
strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive
evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human
players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work
presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like
social reasoning across multimodal domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出MKMed框架，通过跨模态编码器整合多种药物知识，解决药物推荐中的“桶效应”问题，显著提升推荐准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物推荐中不同药物知识数据的不平衡（“桶效应”）限制了模型性能，需要一种方法整合多模态数据以提高推荐效果。

Method: 提出跨模态药物编码器，通过对比学习预训练五种知识模态，并将其与患者记录结合进行推荐。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上，MKMed显著优于现有基线，缓解了“桶效应”。

Conclusion: MKMed通过整合多模态药物知识，有效解决了数据不平衡问题，提升了药物推荐的准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is crucial in healthcare, offering effective
treatments based on patient's electronic health records (EHR). Previous studies
show that integrating more medication-related knowledge improves medication
representation accuracy. However, not all medications encompass multiple types
of knowledge data simultaneously. For instance, some medications provide only
textual descriptions without structured data. This imbalance in data
availability limits the performance of existing models, a challenge we term the
"bucket effect" in medication recommendation. Our data analysis uncovers the
severity of the "bucket effect" in medication recommendation. To fill this gap,
we introduce a cross-modal medication encoder capable of seamlessly aligning
data from different modalities and propose a medication recommendation
framework to integrate Multiple types of Knowledge, named MKMed. Specifically,
we first pre-train a cross-modal encoder with contrastive learning on five
knowledge modalities, aligning them into a unified space. Then, we combine the
multi-knowledge medication representations with patient records for
recommendations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets
demonstrate that MKMed mitigates the "bucket effect" in data, and significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy and safety.

Result: 展示了如何高效生成可验证的最优性证明，适用于任何启发式方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为规划任务提供了可验证的低界证书，扩展了现有算法的应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can
be used to prove the unsolvability of a task or the optimality of a plan in a
way that can be verified by an independent third party. We describe a general
framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on pseudo-Boolean
constraints, which is agnostic to the planning algorithm used.
  As a case study, we show how to modify the $A^{*}$ algorithm to produce
proofs of optimality with modest overhead, using pattern database heuristics
and $h^\textit{max}$ as concrete examples. The same proof logging approach
works for any heuristic whose inferences can be efficiently expressed as
reasoning over pseudo-Boolean constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前放射学报告生成模型缺乏专家结构化推理能力，导致临床信任和解释性不足。BoxMed-RL旨在通过空间验证和解释性提升模型性能。

Method: 框架分为预训练阶段（医学概念学习和空间验证强化学习）和下游适配器阶段（生成流畅且临床可信的报告）。

Result: 在公开数据集上，BoxMed-RL在METEOR和ROUGE-L指标上平均提升7%，在大型语言模型指标上提升5%。

Conclusion: BoxMed-RL通过模仿放射科医生工作流程，显著提升了放射学报告的质量和解释性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation is critical for efficiency but current models
lack the structured reasoning of experts, hindering clinical trust and
explainability by failing to link visual findings to precise anatomical
locations. This paper introduces BoxMed-RL, a groundbreaking unified training
framework for generating spatially verifiable and explainable radiology
reports. Built on a large vision-language model, BoxMed-RL revolutionizes
report generation through two integrated phases: (1) In the Pretraining Phase,
we refine the model via medical concept learning, using Chain-of-Thought
supervision to internalize the radiologist-like workflow, followed by spatially
verifiable reinforcement, which applies reinforcement learning to align medical
findings with bounding boxes. (2) In the Downstream Adapter Phase, we freeze
the pretrained weights and train a downstream adapter to ensure fluent and
clinically credible reports. This framework precisely mimics radiologists'
workflow, compelling the model to connect high-level medical concepts with
definitive anatomical evidence. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that BoxMed-RL achieves an average 7% improvement in both METEOR
and ROUGE-L metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. An average 5%
improvement in large language model-based metrics further underscores
BoxMed-RL's robustness in generating high-quality radiology reports.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化监督成功概率的框架，研究了监督者与被监督者能力不匹配时的监督效果，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决可扩展监督（scalable oversight）在监督超智能系统时的效果问题，研究监督者与被监督者能力差异对监督成功率的影响。

Method: 提出一个框架，将监督建模为能力不匹配玩家之间的博弈，使用监督和欺骗相关的Elo评分量化能力，并通过实验验证框架。

Result: 研究发现，监督成功率随被监督系统能力的增强而下降，嵌套可扩展监督（NSO）的成功率在监督比基线监督者强400 Elo的系统时低于52%。

Conclusion: 监督效果受能力差异显著影响，嵌套监督在特定条件下可能有效，但成功率有限。

Abstract: Scalable oversight, the process by which weaker AI systems supervise stronger
ones, has been proposed as a key strategy to control future superintelligent
systems. However, it is still unclear how scalable oversight itself scales. To
address this gap, we propose a framework that quantifies the probability of
successful oversight as a function of the capabilities of the overseer and the
system being overseen. Specifically, our framework models oversight as a game
between capability-mismatched players; the players have oversight-specific and
deception-specific Elo scores that are a piecewise-linear function of their
general intelligence, with two plateaus corresponding to task incompetence and
task saturation. We validate our framework with a modified version of the game
Nim and then apply it to four oversight games: "Mafia", "Debate", "Backdoor
Code" and "Wargames". For each game, we find scaling laws that approximate how
domain performance depends on general AI system capability (using Chatbot Arena
Elo as a proxy for general capability). We then build on our findings in a
theoretical study of Nested Scalable Oversight (NSO), a process in which
trusted models oversee untrusted stronger models, which then become the trusted
models in the next step. We identify conditions under which NSO succeeds and
derive numerically (and in some cases analytically) the optimal number of
oversight levels to maximize the probability of oversight success. In our
numerical examples, the NSO success rate is below 52% when overseeing systems
that are 400 Elo points stronger than the baseline overseer, and it declines
further for overseeing even stronger systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代通用AI系统的快速发展和潜在危害超出当前风险评估能力，亟需一种系统化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI风险评估提供了系统化解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent
risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential
for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks.
Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions
about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at
assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect
risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic
risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques
from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new
challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying
potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting
evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities.
The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report
card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic
approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis
provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI
system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk
pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts
using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)
Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and
explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or
limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods
by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for
critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI
developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.

TL;DR: 论文研究了强化学习在自动驾驶特权规划中的应用，提出了一种基于单一直观奖励（路线完成度）的新奖励设计，解决了传统复杂奖励在PPO中难以优化的问题，并在CARLA和nuPlan基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶规划方法多为基于规则，难以应对长尾问题。虽然强化学习具有扩展性，但传统复杂奖励设计在PPO中难以优化，限制了方法的扩展性。

Method: 提出了一种基于单一奖励（路线完成度）的新奖励设计，通过终止或惩罚违规行为来优化训练。使用PPO算法，并验证了其在大批量训练中的有效性。

Result: 在CARLA和nuPlan基准测试中，新方法显著优于其他RL方法，分别达到64 DS和91.3/90.6分，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 简单直观的奖励设计能够有效提升PPO在自动驾驶规划中的性能和扩展性，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in
autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based,
but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is
scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning.
Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum
multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We
show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the
mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches.
Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single
intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by
terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find
that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple
reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes
enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to
300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The
resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark,
outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin.
Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is
the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and
90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of
magnitude faster than prior work.

Abstract: This work presents an overview of the technical details behind a high

Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot.
This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end
reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code
publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available
through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean
Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on
hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures
as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from
Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality
reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight
phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple
Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces,
disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail
our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low

Motivation: 研究Transformer架构在强化学习中的潜力，特别是在部分可观测环境和离线学习场景。

Method: 采用Deep Transformer Q-learning Networks (DTQN)进行在线学习，Decision Transformers (DT)进行离线学习。

Result: 在VizDoom环境中，传统方法表现优于基于Transformer的方法。

Conclusion: 尽管Transformer在Atari游戏中表现良好，但在VizDoom环境中传统方法更有效。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Transformer based architectures for
reinforcement learning in both online and offline settings within the Doom game
environment. Our investigation focuses on two primary approaches: Deep
Transformer Q- learning Networks (DTQN) for online learning and Decision
Transformers (DT) for offline reinforcement learning. DTQN leverages the
sequential modelling capabilities of Transformers to enhance Q-learning in
partially observable environments,while Decision Transformers repurpose
sequence modelling techniques to enable offline agents to learn from past
trajectories without direct interaction with the environment. We conclude that
while Transformers might have performed well in Atari games, more traditional
methods perform better than Transformer based method in both the settings in
the VizDoom environment.

Result: 频率域数据在癫痫发作检测中表现最优，检测指标超过97%。

Conclusion: 频率域EEG数据为癫痫发作检测提供了更准确可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Epilepsy, affecting approximately 50 million people globally, is
characterized by abnormal brain activity and remains challenging to treat. The
diagnosis of epilepsy relies heavily on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, where
specialists manually analyze epileptiform patterns across pre-ictal, ictal,
post-ictal, and interictal periods. However, the manual analysis of EEG signals
is prone to variability between experts, emphasizing the need for automated
solutions. Although previous studies have explored preprocessing techniques and
machine learning approaches for seizure detection, there is a gap in
understanding how the representation of EEG data (time, frequency, or
time-frequency domains) impacts the predictive performance of deep learning
models. This work addresses this gap by systematically comparing deep neural
networks trained on EEG data in these three domains. Through the use of
statistical tests, we identify the optimal data representation and model
architecture for epileptic seizure detection. The results demonstrate that
frequency-domain data achieves detection metrics exceeding 97\%, providing a
robust foundation for more accurate and reliable seizure detection systems.

TL;DR: CANet是一种新型架构，通过非平稳自适应归一化模块解决时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据具有非平稳性，传统模型容易过平稳化，导致预测性能下降。

Method: 结合Style Blending Gate和AdaIN模块，保留非平稳特性；采用多分辨率分块和傅里叶分析降噪。

Result: 在真实数据集上，MSE降低42%，MAE降低22%。

Conclusion: CANet有效解决了非平稳性问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in various real-world
applications. Despite recent advancements and the success of different
architectures, forecasting is often challenging due to non-stationary nature of
the real-world data, which frequently exhibit distribution shifts and temporal
changes in statistical properties like mean and variance over time. Previous
studies suggest that this inherent variability complicates forecasting,
limiting the performance of many models by leading to loss of non-stationarity
and resulting in over-stationarization (Liu, Wu, Wang and Long, 2022). To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel architecture, ChoronoAdaptive
Network (CANet), inspired by style-transfer techniques. The core of CANet is
the Non-stationary Adaptive Normalization module, seamlessly integrating the
Style Blending Gate and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) (Huang and
Belongie, 2017). The Style Blending Gate preserves and reintegrates
non-stationary characteristics, such as mean and standard deviation, by
blending internal and external statistics, preventing over-stationarization
while maintaining essential temporal dependencies. Coupled with AdaIN, which
dynamically adapts the model to statistical changes, this approach enhances
predictive accuracy under non-stationary conditions. CANet also employs
multi-resolution patching to handle short-term fluctuations and long-term
trends, along with Fourier analysis-based adaptive thresholding to reduce
noise. A Stacked Kronecker Product Layer further optimizes the model's
efficiency while maintaining high performance. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets validate CANet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a 42% reduction in MSE and a 22% reduction in MAE. The source code is
publicly available at https://github.com/mertsonmezer/CANet.

Result: MixCEM在有无概念干预的情况下，均显著提升了分布内和分布外样本的准确性。

Conclusion: MixCEM有效解决了现有CMs的泄漏污染问题，提升了模型在OOD输入下的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to
out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures
that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then
predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of
concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's
mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are
OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we
term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their
accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce
MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing
from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results
across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate
that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their
accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence
of concept interventions.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging subject in machine learning that aims to
solve multiple tasks presented sequentially to the learner without forgetting
previously learned tasks. Recently, many deep learning based approaches have
been proposed for continual learning, however the mathematical foundations
behind existing continual learning methods remain underdeveloped. On the other
hand, adaptive filtering is a classic subject in signal processing with a rich
history of mathematically principled methods. However, its role in
understanding the foundations of continual learning has been underappreciated.
In this tutorial, we review the basic principles behind both continual learning
and adaptive filtering, and present a comparative analysis that highlights
multiple connections between them. These connections allow us to enhance the
mathematical foundations of continual learning based on existing results for
adaptive filtering, extend adaptive filtering insights using existing continual
learning methods, and discuss a few research directions for continual learning
suggested by the historical developments in adaptive filtering.

Abstract: We present a dynamic self-balancing octree data structure that enables
efficient neighborhood maintenance in evolving metric spaces, a key challenge
in modern machine learning systems. Many learning and generative models operate
as dynamical systems whose representations evolve during training, requiring
fast, adaptive spatial organization. Our two-parameter octree supports
logarithmic-time updates and queries, eliminating the need for costly full
rebuilds as data distributions shift. We demonstrate its effectiveness in four
areas: (1) accelerating Stein variational gradient descent by supporting more
particles with lower overhead; (2) enabling real-time, incremental KNN
classification with logarithmic complexity; (3) facilitating efficient, dynamic
indexing and retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation; and (4) improving
sample efficiency by jointly optimizing input and latent spaces. Across all
applications, our approach yields exponential speedups while preserving
accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where maintaining adaptive
spatial structure is critical.

Motivation: 城市信号灯交叉口的拥堵导致延误、经济损失和排放增加，现有深度学习模型在空间泛化性、复杂架构和实时部署方面存在不足。

Method: 结合时序卷积网络和注意力图神经网络，构建动态、方向感知的交通模型，支持多级交通流优化指标（MOEs）估计。

Result: TGDT在多种交通条件下表现出高鲁棒性和准确性，能够快速模拟大量场景，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGDT为交通信号优化提供了一种高效、可解释且实时的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban congestion at signalized intersections leads to significant delays,
economic losses, and increased emissions. Existing deep learning models often
lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with
real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal
Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic,
direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT
estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at
both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor
level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and
sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of
intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by
accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It
also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic
conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of
traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand
scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable,
and real-time solution for traffic signal optimization.

### [121] [Addressing Concept Mislabeling in Concept Bottleneck Models Through Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18026)
*Emiliano Penaloza,Tianyue H. Zhan,Laurent Charlin,Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的损失函数CPO，用于解决概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）中概念标签不准确的问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs假设数据集包含准确的概念标签，但实践中常违反此假设，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入基于直接偏好优化的CPO目标函数，优化概念的后验分布，减少对标签噪声的敏感性。

Result: CPO在三个真实数据集上均优于传统BCE损失函数，尤其在标签噪声存在时表现更优。

Conclusion: CPO是一种有效的解决方案，能够显著提升CBMs在概念标签不准确情况下的性能。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) propose to enhance the trustworthiness of AI
systems by constraining their decisions on a set of human understandable
concepts. However, CBMs typically assume that datasets contains accurate
concept labels an assumption often violated in practice, which we show can
significantly degrade performance (by 25% in some cases). To address this, we
introduce the Concept Preference Optimization (CPO) objective, a new loss
function based on Direct Preference Optimization, which effectively mitigates
the negative impact of concept mislabeling on CBM performance. We provide an
analysis on some key properties of the CPO objective showing it directly
optimizes for the concept's posterior distribution, and contrast it against
Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) where we show CPO is inherently less sensitive to
concept noise. We empirically confirm our analysis finding that CPO
consistently outperforms BCE in three real world datasets with and without
added label noise.

*Zhongtian Chen,Daniel Murfet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何视角的序列建模方法，通过Hilbert空间框架和局部学习系数（LLC）分析损失景观，揭示了数据模式与网络参数几何的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解序列数据中的模式如何反映在Transformer网络的损失景观中，并探索局部学习系数的实际意义。

Method: 1. 将条件序列分布映射到Hilbert空间，通过张量分解识别主模式；2. 理论证明局部学习系数（LLC）对小幅度模式不敏感。

Result: LLC实际表征的是有效分布而非真实分布的几何特性，解释了为何在非严格最小化损失时仍能获得可靠LLC估计。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了SGLD中逆温度参数如何调节景观结构的分辨率，为理解序列建模的几何特性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We develop a geometric account of sequence modelling that links patterns in
the data to measurable properties of the loss landscape in transformer
networks. First, we cast conditional sequence distributions into a
Hilbert-space framework and apply tensor decompositions to identify their
principal modes. Truncating the small-amplitude modes yields an effective data
distribution that preserves dominant structure while discarding statistical
detail. Second, we show theoretically that Local Learning Coefficient (LLC)
estimates are insensitive to modes below a data-dependent threshold.
Consequently, the LLC calculated in practice characterises the geometry of the
effective rather than the true distribution. This insight clarifies why
reliable LLC estimates can be obtained even when a network parameter is not a
strict minimiser of the population loss, and it highlights how the inverse
temperature in SGLD acts as a resolution dial on the landscape structure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型动物园缺乏结构化多样性，而神经网络相信息提供了模型间的定性差异。结合两者可创建更系统的数据集。

Method: 通过模型架构、大小和数据集的系统变化，构建12个模型动物园，覆盖已知相，并计算损失景观指标。

Result: 数据集覆盖多种模态（如CV、NLP、科学ML），验证了相的全面覆盖，并展示了相在模型训练、分析等应用中的作用。

Conclusion: 该数据集为WSL及其他领域提供了丰富的资源，并证明了相信息在模型应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Using the weights of trained Neural Network (NN) models as data modality has
recently gained traction as a research field - dubbed Weight Space Learning
(WSL). Multiple recent works propose WSL methods to analyze models, evaluate
methods, or synthesize weights. Weight space learning methods require
populations of trained models as datasets for development and evaluation.
However, existing collections of models - called `model zoos' - are
unstructured or follow a rudimentary definition of diversity. In parallel, work
rooted in statistical physics has identified phases and phase transitions in NN
models. Models are homogeneous within the same phase but qualitatively differ
from one phase to another. We combine the idea of `model zoos' with phase
information to create a controlled notion of diversity in populations. We
introduce 12 large-scale zoos that systematically cover known phases and vary
over model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets cover different
modalities, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and
scientific ML. For every model, we compute loss landscape metrics and validate
full coverage of the phases. With this dataset, we provide the community with a
resource with a wide range of potential applications for WSL and beyond.
Evidence suggests the loss landscape phase plays a role in applications such as
model training, analysis, or sparsification. We demonstrate this in an
exploratory study of the downstream methods like transfer learning or model
weights averaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式光伏（PV）安装的快速增长导致能源管理和电网运营的复杂性增加，尤其是隐私问题和大规模数据需求。

Method: 采用两级框架，本地层面使用基于Transformer的模型生成太阳辐照度嵌入，并采用自适应本地聚合机制；全局层面通过中央服务器实现跨中心知识共享。

Result: 实验证明该方法在准确性和鲁棒性上优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了统计异质性问题，同时保护了隐私。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) installations worldwide,
many being behind-the-meter systems, has significantly challenged energy
management and grid operations, as unobservable PV generation further
complicates the supply-demand balance. Therefore, estimating this generation
from net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns
and the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a
promising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical
and behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV
disaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed
PV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning
(PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local
and global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation
model is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing
local PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to
mitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting
a portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global
level, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data
centers, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed
framework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COMM-RAND是一种结合社区结构感知和随机化的GNN小批量训练方法，显著提升训练效率且保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN小批量训练方法要么忽略结构效率（随机化），要么牺牲模型精度（确定性结构），需平衡两者。

Method: 提出COMM-RAND，在构建小批量时兼顾图结构社区性和随机性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，训练时间减少1.8倍（最高2.76倍），精度损失平均仅0.42%。

Conclusion: COMM-RAND在效率与精度间取得平衡，为GNN训练提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and
mini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs
because it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current
mini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of
GNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ
randomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these
randomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the
graph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory
access patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU
caches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on
graph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness
compromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In
this paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching
(COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above
extremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure
randomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction,
leading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We
evaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND
cuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an
accuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular
random mini-batching approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统惩罚方法在PINN中无法精确满足边界条件，且对惩罚参数敏感，限制了求解精度。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在复杂非凸几何形状下，比惩罚方法更准确高效地解决逆问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为PINN逆分析提供了可靠高效的框架，具有广泛的工程应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have attracted significant attention in
scientific machine learning for their capability to solve forward and inverse
problems governed by partial differential equations. However, the accuracy of
PINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions.
Conventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as
penalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the
given boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty
parameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically
R-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these
limitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate
representation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and
facilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance
function-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using
PINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and
efficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through
several numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method
solves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based
methods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries. This approach
offers a reliable and efficient framework for inverse analysis using PINNs,
with potential applications across a wide range of engineering problems.

Motivation: 现有研究多依赖被试个体数据，本研究旨在开发一种不依赖被试个体的方法，利用EEG数据区分冥想状态与静息状态。

Method: 提出三种架构：CSP-LDA（特征提取与分类）、CSP-LDA-LSTM（特征提取、降维与序列分类）和SVD-NN（特征选择与分类）。

Result: CSP-LDA-LSTM架构在个体内分类中达到98.2%准确率，SVD-NN架构在跨被试分类中达到96.4%准确率。

Conclusion: 两种架构能捕捉被试不变特征，高准确率表明其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: While it is beneficial to objectively determine whether a subject is
meditating, most research in the literature reports good results only in a
subject-dependent manner. This study aims to distinguish the modified state of
consciousness experienced during Rajyoga meditation from the resting state of
the brain in a subject-independent manner using EEG data. Three architectures
have been proposed and evaluated: The CSP-LDA Architecture utilizes common
spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM Architecture employs CSP for feature
extraction, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks for classification, modeling the binary classification problem as a
sequence learning problem. The SVD-NN Architecture uses singular value
decomposition (SVD) to select the most relevant components of the EEG signals
and a shallow neural network (NN) for classification. The CSP-LDA-LSTM
architecture gives the best performance with 98.2% accuracy for intra-subject
classification. The SVD-NN architecture provides significant performance with
96.4\% accuracy for inter-subject classification. This is comparable to the
best-reported accuracies in the literature for intra-subject classification.
Both architectures are capable of capturing subject-invariant EEG features for
effectively classifying the meditative state from the resting state. The high
intra-subject and inter-subject classification accuracies indicate these
systems' robustness and their ability to generalize across different subjects.

Abstract: The number of electrified powertrains is ever increasing today towards a more
sustainable future; thus, it is essential that unwanted failures are prevented,
and a reliable operation is secured. Monitoring the internal temperatures of
motors and keeping them under their thresholds is an important first step.
Conventional modeling methods require expert knowledge and complicated
mathematical approaches. With all the data a modern electric drive collects
nowadays during the system operation, it is feasible to apply data-driven
approaches for estimating thermal behaviors. In this paper, multiple
machine-learning methods are investigated on their capability to approximate
the temperatures of the stator winding and bearing in induction motors. The
explored algorithms vary from linear to neural networks. For this reason,
experimental lab data have been captured from a powertrain under predetermined
operating conditions. For each approach, a hyperparameter search is then
performed to find the optimal configuration. All the models are evaluated by
various metrics, and it has been found that neural networks perform
satisfactorily even under transient conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for developing surrogate environments in
reinforcement learning (RL) using the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear

through extensive experiments in OpenAI Gym environments, particularly Mountain
Car and Lunar Lander. Our results show that SINDy-based surrogate models can
accurately capture the underlying dynamics of these environments while reducing
computational costs by 20-35%. With only 75 interactions for Mountain Car and
1000 for Lunar Lander, we achieve state-wise correlations exceeding 0.997, with
mean squared errors as low as 3.11e-06 for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42e-06
for LunarLander position. RL agents trained in these surrogate environments
require fewer total steps (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs.
1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) while achieving comparable performance to those
trained in the original environments, exhibiting similar convergence patterns
and final performance metrics. This work contributes to the field of
model-based RL by providing an efficient method for generating accurate,
interpretable surrogate environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in

using ground-truth pruning to ensure high-quality training data. This approach
yields improved performance: on GSM8K, Gemma2-2B achieves a Pass@1 of 57.6%
(from 41.9%), Gemma2-9B reaches 82%, matching LLaMA-3.1-70B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B

Conclusion: SBTM是一种高效、通用的采样方法，适用于非对数凹目标，优于基线方法ULA和退火ULA。

Abstract: We propose and analyze a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based
Transport Modeling (SBTM) for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$.
While diffusion generative modeling relies on pre-training the score function
$\nabla \log f_t$ using samples from $\pi$, SBTM addresses the more general and
challenging setting where only $\nabla \log\pi$ is known. SBTM approximates the
Wasserstein gradient flow on KL$(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score
$\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. The learned score gives
immediate access to relative Fisher information, providing a built-in
convergence diagnostic. The deterministic trajectories are smooth,
interpretable, and free of Brownian-motion noise, while having the same
distribution as ULA. We prove that SBTM dissipates relative entropy at the same
rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. We further
extend our framework to annealed dynamics, to handle non log-concave targets.
Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: SBTM converges at the
optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is easily integrated with annealed
dynamics. We compare to the baselines of ULA and annealed ULA.

Motivation: 解决不平衡数据集中少数类检测困难的问题，特别是在风险评估等实际应用中。

Method: 提出数据准备方法，结合树提升方法和超参数优化，并在不同规模和分布的数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 提出的方法对数据变化具有一定鲁棒性，性能下降时可考虑重新训练。

Abstract: Most real-world classification problems deal with imbalanced datasets, posing
a challenge for Artificial Intelligence (AI), i.e., machine learning
algorithms, because the minority class, which is of extreme interest, often
proves difficult to be detected. This paper empirically evaluates tree boosting
methods' performance given different dataset sizes and class distributions,
from perfectly balanced to highly imbalanced. For tabular data, tree-based
methods such as XGBoost, stand out in several benchmarks due to detection
performance and speed. Therefore, XGBoost and Imbalance-XGBoost are evaluated.
After introducing the motivation to address risk assessment with machine
learning, the paper reviews evaluation metrics for detection systems or binary
classifiers. It proposes a method for data preparation followed by tree
boosting methods including hyper-parameter optimization. The method is
evaluated on private datasets of 1 thousand (K), 10K and 100K samples on
distributions with 50, 45, 25, and 5 percent positive samples. As expected, the
developed method increases its recognition performance as more data is given
for training and the F1 score decreases as the data distribution becomes more
imbalanced, but it is still significantly superior to the baseline of
precision-recall determined by the ratio of positives divided by positives and
negatives. Sampling to balance the training set does not provide consistent
improvement and deteriorates detection. In contrast, classifier hyper-parameter
optimization improves recognition, but should be applied carefully depending on
data volume and distribution. Finally, the developed method is robust to data
variation over time up to some point. Retraining can be used when performance
starts deteriorating.

Conclusion: CSG2L有效解决了对比信号问题，提升了图学习性能。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has garnered significant attention recently
since it learns complex structural information from graphs through
self-supervised learning manner. However, prevalent GCL models may suffer from
performance degradation due to inappropriate contrastive signals. Concretely,
they commonly generate augmented views based on random perturbation, which
leads to biased essential structures due to the introduction of noise. In
addition, they assign equal weight to both hard and easy sample pairs, thereby
ignoring the difference in importance of the sample pairs. To address these
issues, this study proposes a novel Contrastive Signal Generative Framework for
Accurate Graph Learning (CSG2L) with the following two-fold ideas: a) building
a singular value decomposition (SVD)-directed augmented module (SVD-aug) to
obtain the global interactions as well as avoiding the random noise
perturbation; b) designing a local-global dependency learning module (LGDL)
with an adaptive reweighting strategy which can differentiate the effects of
hard and easy sample pairs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CSG2L outperforms the state-of-art baselines.
Moreover, CSG2L is compatible with a variety of GNNs.

Conclusion: 新方法在行为多样性和可控轨迹生成方面优于现有技术。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) techniques aim to replicate human behaviors in
specific tasks. While IL has gained prominence due to its effectiveness and
efficiency, traditional methods often focus on datasets collected from experts
to produce a single efficient policy. Recently, extensions have been proposed
to handle datasets of diverse behaviors by mainly focusing on learning
transition-level diverse policies or on performing entropy maximization at the
trajectory level. While these methods may lead to diverse behaviors, they may
not be sufficient to reproduce the actual diversity of demonstrations or to
allow controlled trajectory generation. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose
a different method based on two key features: a) Temporal Consistency that
ensures consistent behaviors across entire episodes and not just at the
transition level as well as b) Controllability obtained by constructing a
latent space of behaviors that allows users to selectively activate specific
behaviors based on their requirements. We compare our approach to
state-of-the-art methods over a diverse set of tasks and environments. Project

Motivation: 传统海洋区域划分常为主观决策，可能导致误导性结果。研究旨在通过客观方法定义北大西洋区域。

Result: UMAP-DBSCAN表现最佳，生成321个集群，可重复性高（88.81%重叠率），结果与传统水团定义一致且更详细。

Conclusion: 该方法客观、高效、可重复，有助于未来海洋生物地球化学差异和变化研究。

Abstract: Defining ocean regions and water masses helps to understand marine processes
and can serve downstream-tasks such as defining marine protected areas.
However, such definitions are often a result of subjective decisions
potentially producing misleading, unreproducible results. Here, the aim was to
objectively define regions of the North Atlantic. For this, a data-driven,
systematic machine learning approach was applied to generate and validate ocean
clusters employing external, internal and relative validation techniques. About
300 million measured salinity, temperature, and oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and
silicate concentration values served as input for various clustering methods
(KMeans, agglomerative Ward, and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)). Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP) emphasised (dis-)similarities in the data while reducing
dimensionality. Based on a systematic validation of the considered clustering
methods and their hyperparameters, the results showed that UMAP-DBSCAN best
represented the data. To address stochastic variability, 100 UMAP-DBSCAN
clustering runs were conducted and aggregated using Native Emergent Manifold
Interrogation (NEMI), producing a final set of 321 clusters. Reproducibility
was evaluated by calculating the ensemble overlap (88.81 +- 1.8%) and the mean
grid cell-wise uncertainty estimated by NEMI (15.49 +- 20%). The presented
clustering results agreed very well with common water mass definitions. This
study revealed a more detailed regionalization compared to previous concepts
such as the Longhurst provinces. The applied method is objective, efficient and
reproducible and will support future research focusing on biogeochemical
differences and changes in oceanic regions.

Method: 使用LSTM和GRU网络对两个数据集（金融股票数据和合成活动数据）进行预测，评估指标为RMSE和方向准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source and reproducible implementation of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Networks for time
series forecasting. We evaluated LSTM and GRU networks because of their
performance reported in related work. We describe our method and its results on
two datasets. The first dataset is the S&P BSE BANKEX, composed of stock time
series (closing prices) of ten financial institutions. The second dataset,
called Activities, comprises ten synthetic time series resembling weekly
activities with five days of high activity and two days of low activity. We
report Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between actual and predicted values, as
well as Directional Accuracy (DA). We show that a single time series from a
dataset can be used to adequately train the networks if the sequences in the
dataset contain patterns that repeat, even with certain variation, and are
properly processed. For 1-step ahead and 20-step ahead forecasts, LSTM and GRU
networks significantly outperform a baseline on the Activities dataset. The
baseline simply repeats the last available value. On the stock market dataset,
the networks perform just like the baseline, possibly due to the nature of
these series. We release the datasets used as well as the implementation with
all experiments performed to enable future comparisons and to make our research
reproducible.

Conclusion: 所提方法在方向准确性上与现有最优方法表现相当，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that is gaining more popularity in
recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not
enough to forecast stock market series. We introduce a new set of time series
and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy
based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time
series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that
the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy
are Open, High and Low, with the largest contribution of Low in combination
with an ensemble of Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The
relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is
negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the
state-of-the-art when observing directional accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了激活函数与样条回归/平滑的关系，分析了其对1D浅层网络频谱偏置的影响，并提出梯度下降（GD）作为收缩操作调节频谱偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究激活函数选择对神经网络频谱偏置的影响，并探索梯度下降在调节频谱偏置中的作用。

Method: 通过理论分析GD作为收缩操作对Jacobian矩阵奇异值的掩蔽作用，提出GD超参数与带宽的显式关系。

Result: GD正则化仅在单调激活函数中有效，非单调激活函数（如sinc、高斯）可作为频谱偏置的高效替代。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择和GD超参数调节共同影响频谱偏置，非单调激活函数在迭代效率上具有优势。

Abstract: We generalize the connection between activation function and spline
regression/smoothing and characterize how this choice may influence spectral
bias within a 1D shallow network. We then demonstrate how gradient descent (GD)
can be reinterpreted as a shrinkage operator that masks the singular values of
a neural network's Jacobian. Viewed this way, GD implicitly selects the number
of frequency components to retain, thereby controlling the spectral bias. An
explicit relationship is proposed between the choice of GD hyperparameters
(learning rate & number of iterations) and bandwidth (the number of active
components). GD regularization is shown to be effective only with monotonic
activation functions. Finally, we highlight the utility of non-monotonic
activation functions (sinc, Gaussian) as iteration-efficient surrogates for
spectral bias.

Result: 在正则化强度趋近于零时，特征分布动态对应加权超快扩散方程，证明其收敛于教师分布。

Conclusion: 变量投影算法在教师-学生框架下能有效保证特征分布的收敛性。

Abstract: We study the convergence of gradient methods for the training of mean-field
single hidden layer neural networks with square loss. Observing this is a
separable non-linear least-square problem which is linear w.r.t. the outer
layer's weights, we consider a Variable Projection (VarPro) or two-timescale
learning algorithm, thereby eliminating the linear variables and reducing the
learning problem to the training of the feature distribution. Whereas most
convergence rates or the training of neural networks rely on a neural tangent
kernel analysis where features are fixed, we show such a strategy enables
provable convergence rates for the sampling of a teacher feature distribution.
Precisely, in the limit where the regularization strength vanishes, we show
that the dynamic of the feature distribution corresponds to a weighted
ultra-fast diffusion equation. Relying on recent results on the asymptotic
behavior of such PDEs, we obtain guarantees for the convergence of the trained
feature distribution towards the teacher feature distribution in a
teacher-student setup.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery lifespan is vital for ensuring
operational reliability and reducing maintenance costs in applications like
electric vehicles and smart grids. This study presents a hybrid learning
framework for precise battery lifespan prediction, integrating dynamic
multi-source data fusion with a stacked ensemble (SE) modeling approach. By
leveraging heterogeneous datasets from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE),
MIT-Stanford-Toyota Research Institute (TRC), and nickel cobalt aluminum (NCA)
chemistries, an entropy-based dynamic weighting mechanism mitigates variability
across heterogeneous datasets. The SE model combines Ridge regression, long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
effectively capturing temporal dependencies and nonlinear degradation patterns.
It achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0058, root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.0092, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9839,
outperforming established baseline models with a 46.2% improvement in R2 and an
83.2% reduction in RMSE. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis
identifies differential discharge capacity (Qdlin) and temperature of
measurement (Temp_m) as critical aging indicators. This scalable, interpretable
framework enhances battery health management, supporting optimized maintenance
and safety across diverse energy storage systems, thereby contributing to
improved battery health management in energy storage systems.

Motivation: 多跳问答任务在现实应用中普遍存在，但现有方法在动态知识的识别和组织上仍有不足。

Method: 提出DualRAG框架，结合RaQ和pKA两个紧密耦合的过程，实现推理与检索的无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明，DualRAG显著提高了答案的准确性和连贯性，甚至在某些情况下超越了对知识库的完全访问。

Conclusion: DualRAG是解决复杂多跳推理任务的强大且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications,
posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse
knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative
retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To
address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that
seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two
tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive
Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the
reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired
knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This
creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement.
Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and
retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its
versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer
accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the
performance achieved with oracle knowledge access. These results establish
DualRAG as a robust and efficient solution for complex multi-hop reasoning
tasks.

Motivation: 传统决策树方法逐节点递归构建，计算复杂度高，且缺乏对公平性的考虑。本文旨在提出一种局部公平性准则，并将其融入标准递归树估计算法中。

Method: 提出C-LRT算法，修改标准CART算法，使用局部线性分类器并引入约束逻辑回归的限制条件。

Result: 在常用公平性数据集上评估，C-LRT能够有效控制和平衡分类准确性与公平性。

Conclusion: C-LRT算法成功实现了对准确性与公平性的平衡控制，为算法公平性领域提供了新方法。

Abstract: Given the high computational complexity of decision tree estimation,
classical methods construct a tree by adding one node at a time in a recursive
way. To facilitate promoting fairness, we propose a fairness criterion local to
the tree nodes. We prove how it is related to the Statistical Parity criterion,
popular in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, and show how to incorporate it
into standard recursive tree estimation algorithms.
  We present a tree estimation algorithm called Constrained Logistic Regression
Tree (C-LRT), which is a modification of the standard CART algorithm using
locally linear classifiers and imposing restrictions as done in Constrained
Logistic Regression.
  Finally, we evaluate the performance of trees estimated with C-LRT on
datasets commonly used in the Algorithmic Fairness literature, using various
classification and fairness metrics. The results confirm that C-LRT
successfully allows to control and balance accuracy and fairness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了神经算子在Hughes模型中学习解的局限性，发现其在复杂场景（如多初始间断和动态边界条件）下表现不佳，预测解过于平滑，丢失了重要物理特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hughes模型是一类非线性双曲系统，具有复杂的解结构（如激波和间断）。研究旨在评估神经算子在处理此类问题时的性能。

Method: 评估了三种先进的神经算子（傅里叶神经算子、小波神经算子和多小波神经算子）在不同挑战性场景（间断和高斯初始条件、多样边界条件）中的表现，并考察了数值格式的影响。

Result: 神经算子在简单场景中表现良好，但在复杂场景中预测解过于平滑，导致总变差减少和物理特征丢失。

Conclusion: 当前神经算子架构可能引入非预期的正则化效应，限制了其对间断主导的输运动态的捕捉能力，对交通应用中的激波保持提出了挑战。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning
solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system
for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing
pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes
model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit
complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this
study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators
(Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural
Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1)
discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary
conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios
with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in
complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary
conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The
predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total
variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is
similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce
artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves
in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator
architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their
ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also
raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where
shock preservation is essential.

Motivation: 研究神经网络的可解释性，通过扰动数据分布分析网络组件的局部响应，以揭示其功能模块。

Method: 使用贝叶斯统计力学框架，通过小扰动数据分布（如改变文本类型）诱导网络后验期望的变化，利用局部SGLD样本估计响应。

Result: 响应矩阵的低秩结构能够分离功能模块（如多词和归纳头），并量化数据分布变化对损失景观几何的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络的可解释性提供了新工具，连接了局部学习系数与线性响应理论。

Abstract: We develop a linear response framework for interpretability that treats a
neural network as a Bayesian statistical mechanical system. A small, controlled
perturbation of the data distribution, for example shifting the Pile toward
GitHub or legal text, induces a first-order change in the posterior expectation
of an observable localized on a chosen component of the network. The resulting
susceptibility can be estimated efficiently with local SGLD samples and
factorizes into signed, per-token contributions that serve as attribution
scores. Building a set of perturbations (probes) yields a response matrix whose
low-rank structure separates functional modules such as multigram and induction
heads in a 3M-parameter transformer. Susceptibilities link local learning
coefficients from singular learning theory with linear-response theory, and
quantify how local loss landscape geometry deforms under shifts in the data
distribution.

Result: 提出了四类分类器指标和一类目标检测指标，为研究者提供了实现和比较的工具。

Conclusion: 校准指标对模型可信度和性能评估至关重要，本文的系统整理为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Probabilities or confidence values produced by artificial intelligence (AI)
and machine learning (ML) models often do not reflect their true accuracy, with
some models being under or over confident in their predictions. For example, if
a model is 80% sure of an outcome, is it correct 80% of the time? Probability
calibration metrics measure the discrepancy between confidence and accuracy,
providing an independent assessment of model calibration performance that
complements traditional accuracy metrics. Understanding calibration is
important when the outputs of multiple systems are combined, for assurance in
safety or business-critical contexts, and for building user trust in models.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of probability calibration metrics
for classifier and object detection models, organising them according to a
number of different categorisations to highlight their relationships. We
identify 82 major metrics, which can be grouped into four classifier families
(point-based, bin-based, kernel or curve-based, and cumulative) and an object
detection family. For each metric, we provide equations where available,
facilitating implementation and comparison by future researchers.

Conclusion: 拓扑结构和宏动作抽象能从像素数据中实现高效学习。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of navigation in large, visually complex
environments with sparse rewards. We propose a method that uses object-oriented
macro actions grounded in a topological map, allowing a simple Deep Q-Network
(DQN) to learn effective navigation policies. The agent builds a map by
detecting objects from RGBD input and selecting discrete macro actions that
correspond to navigating to these objects. This abstraction drastically reduces
the complexity of the underlying reinforcement learning problem and enables
generalization to unseen environments. We evaluate our approach in a
photorealistic 3D simulation and show that it significantly outperforms a
random baseline under both immediate and terminal reward conditions. Our
results demonstrate that topological structure and macro-level abstraction can
enable sample-efficient learning even from pixel data.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential for facilitating diverse socio-economic
activity and environmental conservation initiatives. Deep learning techniques
are increasingly being explored as complementary approaches to Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) models, offering potential benefits such as reduced
complexity and enhanced adaptability in specific applications. This work
presents a novel design, Small Shuffled Attention UNet (SSA-UNet), which
enhances SmaAt-UNet's architecture by including a shuffle channeling mechanism
to optimize performance and diminish complexity. To assess its efficacy, this
architecture and its reduced variant are examined and trained on two datasets:
a Dutch precipitation dataset from 2016 to 2019, and a French cloud cover
dataset containing radar images from 2017 to 2018. Three output configurations
of the proposed architecture are evaluated, yielding outputs of 1, 6, and 12
precipitation maps, respectively. To better understand how this model operates
and produces its predictions, a gradient-based approach called Grad-CAM is used
to analyze the outputs generated. The analysis of heatmaps generated by
Grad-CAM facilitated the identification of regions within the input maps that
the model considers most informative for generating its predictions. The

Abstract: Balancing performance and interpretability in multivariate time series
classification is a significant challenge due to data complexity and high
dimensionality. This paper introduces PHeatPruner, a method integrating
persistent homology and sheaf theory to address these challenges. Persistent
homology facilitates the pruning of up to 45% of the applied variables while
maintaining or enhancing the accuracy of models such as Random Forest,
CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM, all without depending on posterior
probabilities or supervised optimization algorithms. Concurrently, sheaf theory
contributes explanatory vectors that provide deeper insights into the data's
structural nuances. The approach was validated using the UEA Archive and a
mastitis detection dataset for dairy cows. The results demonstrate that
PHeatPruner effectively preserves model accuracy. Furthermore, our results
highlight PHeatPruner's key features, i.e. simplifying complex data and
offering actionable insights without increasing processing time or complexity.
This method bridges the gap between complexity reduction and interpretability,
suggesting promising applications in various fields.

Abstract: The biases in artificial intelligence (AI) models can lead to automated
decision-making processes that discriminate against groups and/or individuals
based on sensitive properties such as gender and race. While there are many
studies on diagnosing and mitigating biases in various AI models, there is
little research on individual fairness in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Unlike
traditional models, which treat data features independently and overlook their
inter-relationships, GNNs are designed to capture graph-based structure where
nodes are interconnected. This relational approach enables GNNs to model
complex dependencies, but it also means that biases can propagate through these
connections, complicating the detection and mitigation of individual fairness
violations. This PhD project aims to develop a testing framework to assess and
ensure individual fairness in GNNs. It first systematically reviews the
literature on individual fairness, categorizing existing approaches to define,
measure, test, and mitigate model biases, creating a taxonomy of individual
fairness. Next, the project will develop a framework for testing and ensuring
fairness in GNNs by adapting and extending current fairness testing and
mitigation techniques. The framework will be evaluated through industrial case
studies, focusing on graph-based large language models.

Conclusion: XAI框架有效解决了AI模型与人类决策者之间的理解鸿沟。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks
presents significant mobility management challenges, primarily due to frequent
handovers caused by probabilistic line-of-sight conditions with multiple ground
base stations (BSs). To tackle these challenges, reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods, particularly deep Q-networks (DQN), have been employed to
optimize handover decisions dynamically. However, a major drawback of these
learning-based approaches is their black-box nature, which limits
interpretability in the decision-making process. This paper introduces an
explainable AI (XAI) framework that incorporates Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) to provide deeper insights into how various state parameters influence
handover decisions in a DQN-based mobility management system. By quantifying
the impact of key features such as reference signal received power (RSRP),
reference signal received quality (RSRQ), buffer status, and UAV position, our
approach enhances the interpretability and reliability of RL-based handover
solutions. To validate and compare our framework, we utilize real-world network
performance data collected from UAV flight trials. Simulation results show that
our method provides intuitive explanations for policy decisions, effectively
bridging the gap between AI-driven models and human decision-makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习中缺失数据问题已有研究，但模型评估中标签缺失问题被忽视，传统忽略缺失值方法在MNAR情况下会引入偏差。

Method: 采用多重插补技术，为分类器评估提供点估计和预测分布，适用于精度、召回率和ROC-AUC等指标。

Result: 实证表明预测分布的位置和形状在MNAR情况下仍准确，且分布近似高斯，提供了有限样本收敛边界。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实误差模型下有效，通过稳健性证明验证了其近似有效性。

Abstract: Missing data in supervised learning is well-studied, but the specific issue
of missing labels during model evaluation has been overlooked. Ignoring samples
with missing values, a common solution, can introduce bias, especially when
data is Missing Not At Random (MNAR). We propose a multiple imputation
technique for evaluating classifiers using metrics such as precision, recall,
and ROC-AUC. This method not only offers point estimates but also a predictive
distribution for these quantities when labels are missing. We empirically show
that the predictive distribution's location and shape are generally correct,
even in the MNAR regime. Moreover, we establish that this distribution is
approximately Gaussian and provide finite-sample convergence bounds.
Additionally, a robustness proof is presented, confirming the validity of the
approximation under a realistic error model.

Motivation: 研究校准的动机源于对预测系统可信度和算法公平性的讨论，旨在通过自我实现和精确损失估计来统一多样化的校准定义。

Method: 通过反射原理和精算公平性分别支持自我实现和精确损失估计，并提出了Γ-校准和决策校准的原型定义。

Result: 在二元结果集下，两种原型定义在适当条件下一致；高维结果集下，可通过分布校准统一。

Conclusion: 本文为校准的多样化定义提供了语义地图，帮助理解不同概念之间的关系。

Abstract: Fueled by discussions around "trustworthiness" and algorithmic fairness,
calibration of predictive systems has regained scholars attention. The vanilla
definition and understanding of calibration is, simply put, on all days on
which the rain probability has been predicted to be p, the actual frequency of
rain days was p. However, the increased attention has led to an immense variety
of new notions of "calibration." Some of the notions are incomparable, serve
different purposes, or imply each other. In this work, we provide two accounts
which motivate calibration: self-realization of forecasted properties and
precise estimation of incurred losses of the decision makers relying on
forecasts. We substantiate the former via the reflection principle and the
latter by actuarial fairness. For both accounts we formulate prototypical
definitions via properties $\Gamma$ of outcome distributions, e.g., the mean or
median. The prototypical definition for self-realization, which we call
$\Gamma$-calibration, is equivalent to a certain type of swap regret under
certain conditions. These implications are strongly connected to the
omniprediction learning paradigm. The prototypical definition for precise loss
estimation is a modification of decision calibration adopted from Zhao et al.
[73]. For binary outcome sets both prototypical definitions coincide under
appropriate choices of reference properties. For higher-dimensional outcome
sets, both prototypical definitions can be subsumed by a natural extension of
the binary definition, called distribution calibration with respect to a
property. We conclude by commenting on the role of groupings in both accounts
of calibration often used to obtain multicalibration. In sum, this work
provides a semantic map of calibration in order to navigate a fragmented
terrain of notions and definitions.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on
online/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in
porous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless
numbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified
numerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic
control of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and
online learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This
strategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying
a single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning
the attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work
performs a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning
features), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate
a decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate,
realistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model
into an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\% reduction in
computational time.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial in machine learning, yet most

In this work, we introduce a set of axioms to rigorously assess measures of
aleatoric, epistemic, and total uncertainty in supervised regression. By
utilizing a predictive exponential family, we can generalize commonly used
approaches for uncertainty representation and corresponding uncertainty
measures. More specifically, we analyze the widely used entropy- and
variance-based measures regarding limitations and challenges. Our findings
provide a principled foundation for UQ in regression, offering theoretical
insights and practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty assessment.

Motivation: 理解预训练模型在类增量学习（CIL）中特征的演化与分布是一个开放性问题，神经崩溃（NC）现象为这一挑战提供了新的视角。

Method: 提出NCPTM-CIL方法，通过动态调整特征空间以符合NC的几何结构，优化持续学习过程。

Result: 实验表明，NCPTM-CIL在四个基准数据集上优于现有方法，特别是在ViT-B/16-IN1K初始化下表现突出。

Conclusion: NCPTM-CIL通过结合NC现象，显著提升了CIL的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) is a critical capability for real-world
applications, enabling learning systems to adapt to new tasks while retaining
knowledge from previous ones. Recent advancements in pre-trained models (PTMs)
have significantly advanced the field of CIL, demonstrating superior
performance over traditional methods. However, understanding how features
evolve and are distributed across incremental tasks remains an open challenge.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to modeling feature evolution in
PTM-based CIL through the lens of neural collapse (NC), a striking phenomenon
observed in the final phase of training, which leads to a well-separated,
equiangular feature space. We explore the connection between NC and CIL
effectiveness, showing that aligning feature distributions with the NC geometry
enhances the ability to capture the dynamic behavior of continual learning.
Based on this insight, we introduce Neural Collapse-inspired Pre-Trained
Model-based CIL (NCPTM-CIL), a method that dynamically adjusts the feature
space to conform to the elegant NC structure, thereby enhancing the continual
learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NCPTM-CIL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets. Notably, when
initialized with ViT-B/16-IN1K, NCPTM-CIL surpasses the runner-up method by
6.73% on VTAB, 1.25% on CIFAR-100, and 2.5% on OmniBenchmark.

Abstract: Due to rapid population growth globally, digitally-enabled agricultural
sectors are crucial for sustainable food production and making informed
decisions about resource management for farmers and various stakeholders. The
deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that collect real-time
observations of various environmental (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and
operational factors (e.g., irrigation) influencing production is often seen as
a critical step to enable additional novel downstream tasks, such as AI-based
yield forecasting. However, since AI models require large amounts of data, this
creates practical challenges in a real-world dynamic farm setting where IoT
observations would need to be collected over a number of seasons. In this
study, we deployed IoT sensors in strawberry production polytunnels for two
growing seasons to collect environmental data, including water usage, external
and internal temperature, external and internal humidity, soil moisture, soil
temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation. The sensor observations
were combined with manually provided yield records spanning a period of four
seasons. To bridge the gap of missing IoT observations for two additional
seasons, we propose an AI-based backcasting approach to generate synthetic
sensor observations using historical weather data from a nearby weather station
and the existing polytunnel observations. We built an AI-based yield
forecasting model to evaluate our approach using the combination of real and
synthetic observations. Our results demonstrated that incorporating synthetic
data improved yield forecasting accuracy, with models incorporating synthetic
data outperforming those trained only on historical yield, weather records, and
real sensor data.

Abstract: Following AI scaling trends, frontier models continue to grow in size and
continue to be trained on larger datasets. Training these models requires huge
investments in exascale computational resources, which has in turn driven
development of distributed deep learning methods. Data parallelism is an
essential approach to speed up training, but it requires frequent global
communication between workers, which can bottleneck training at the largest
scales. In this work, we propose a method called Pseudo-Asynchronous Local SGD
(PALSGD) to improve the efficiency of data-parallel training. PALSGD is an
extension of Local SGD (Stich, 2018) and DiLoCo (Douillard et al., 2023),
designed to further reduce communication frequency by introducing a
pseudo-synchronization mechanism. PALSGD allows the use of longer
synchronization intervals compared to standard Local SGD. Despite the reduced
communication frequency, the pseudo-synchronization approach ensures that model
consistency is maintained, leading to performance results comparable to those
achieved with more frequent synchronization. Furthermore, we provide a
theoretical analysis of PALSGD, establishing its convergence and deriving its
convergence rate. This analysis offers insights into the algorithm's behavior
and performance guarantees. We evaluated PALSGD on image classification and
language modeling tasks. Our results show that PALSGD achieves better
performance in less time compared to existing methods like Distributed Data
Parallel (DDP), and DiLoCo. Notably, PALSGD trains 18.4% faster than DDP on
ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50, 24.4% faster than DDP on TinyStories with
GPT-Neo125M, and 21.1% faster than DDP on TinyStories with GPT-Neo-8M.

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松整合到新生成模型中，具有实际应用价值，尤其是在数据规模扩大和模型改进的背景下。

Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths
connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the
complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches
use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their
ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as
high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we
address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from
stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained
generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under
these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to
minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to
repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in
contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We
demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse,
physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the
pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily
incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as
models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising technique for learning-based functions
in wireless networks, thanks to its distributed implementation capability. On
the other hand, distributed learning may increase the risk of exposure to
malicious attacks where attacks on a local model may spread to other models by
parameter exchange. Meanwhile, such attacks can be hard to detect due to the
dynamic wireless environment, especially considering local models can be
heterogeneous with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data.
Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the effect of malicious attacks and
develop advanced defense techniques for FL-enabled wireless networks. In this
work, we introduce a federated deep reinforcement learning-based cell sleep
control scenario that enhances the energy efficiency of the network. We propose
multiple intelligent attacks targeting the learning-based approach and we
propose defense methods to mitigate such attacks. In particular, we have
designed two attack models, generative adversarial network (GAN)-enhanced model
poisoning attack and regularization-based model poisoning attack. As a
counteraction, we have proposed two defense schemes, autoencoder-based defense,
and knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled defense. The autoencoder-based defense
method leverages an autoencoder to identify the malicious participants and only
aggregate the parameters of benign local models during the global aggregation,
while KD-based defense protects the model from attacks by controlling the
knowledge transferred between the global model and local models.

Abstract: Imitation learning holds the promise of equipping robots with versatile
skills by learning from expert demonstrations. However, policies trained on
finite datasets often struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution.
In this work, we present a unified perspective on the generalization capability
of imitation learning, grounded in both information theorey and data
distribution property. We first show that the generalization gap can be upper
bounded by (i) the conditional information bottleneck on intermediate
representations and (ii) the mutual information between the model parameters
and the training dataset. This characterization provides theoretical guidance
for designing effective training strategies in imitation learning, particularly
in determining whether to freeze, fine-tune, or train large pretrained encoders
(e.g., vision-language models or vision foundation models) from scratch to
achieve better generalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high
conditional entropy from input to output induces a flatter likelihood
landscape, thereby reducing the upper bound on the generalization gap. In
addition, it shortens the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) escape time from
sharp local minima, which may increase the likelihood of reaching global optima
under fixed optimization budgets. These insights explain why imitation learning
often exhibits limited generalization and underscore the importance of not only
scaling the diversity of input data but also enriching the variability of
output labels conditioned on the same input.

Abstract: This paper concerns corpus poisoning attacks in dense information retrieval,
where an adversary attempts to compromise the ranking performance of a search
algorithm by injecting a small number of maliciously generated documents into
the corpus. Our work addresses two limitations in the current literature.
First, attacks that perform adversarial gradient-based word substitution search
do so in the discrete lexical space, while retrieval itself happens in the
continuous embedding space. We thus propose an optimization method that
operates in the embedding space directly. Specifically, we train a perturbation
model with the objective of maintaining the geometric distance between the
original and adversarial document embeddings, while also maximizing the
token-level dissimilarity between the original and adversarial documents.
Second, it is common for related work to have a strong assumption that the
adversary has prior knowledge about the queries. In this paper, we focus on a
more challenging variant of the problem where the adversary assumes no prior
knowledge about the query distribution (hence, unsupervised). Our core
contribution is an adversarial corpus attack that is fast and effective. We
present comprehensive experimental results on both in- and out-of-domain
datasets, focusing on two related tasks: a top-1 attack and a corpus poisoning
attack. We consider attacks under both a white-box and a black-box setting.
Notably, our method can generate successful adversarial examples in under two
minutes per target document; four times faster compared to the fastest
gradient-based word substitution methods in the literature with the same
hardware. Furthermore, our adversarial generation method generates text that is
more likely to occur under the distribution of natural text (low perplexity),
and is therefore more difficult to detect.

Abstract: Representation learning, a task of learning latent vectors to represent
entities, is a key task in improving search and recommender systems in web
applications. Various representation learning methods have been developed,
including graph-based approaches for relationships among entities,
sequence-based methods for capturing the temporal evolution of user activities,
and content-based models for leveraging text and visual content. However, the
development of a unifying framework that integrates these diverse techniques to
support multiple applications remains a significant challenge. This paper
presents OmniSage, a large-scale representation framework that learns universal
representations for a variety of applications at Pinterest. OmniSage integrates
graph neural networks with content-based models and user sequence models by
employing multiple contrastive learning tasks to effectively process graph
data, user sequence data, and content signals. To support the training and
inference of OmniSage, we developed an efficient infrastructure capable of
supporting Pinterest graphs with billions of nodes. The universal
representations generated by OmniSage have significantly enhanced user
experiences on Pinterest, leading to an approximate 2.5% increase in sitewide
repins (saves) across five applications. This paper highlights the impact of
unifying representation learning methods, and we will open source the OmniSage
code by the time of publication.

Conclusion: LLM4CDSR通过LLMs的语义能力显著提升了跨域推荐性能，解决了重叠困境和转移复杂性。

Abstract: Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference
from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some
progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,
overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR
methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn
cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter
refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the
mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,
Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by
bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.
Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation
model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose
an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a
trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR
task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize
user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into
the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted
extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种计算模型，模拟婴儿在“移动范式”中的行为机制，探讨其如何学习动作与感觉的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究婴儿如何学习感觉运动关联，这是发展心理学中基础认知能力的关键。

Method: 模型结合神经网络、动作-结果预测、探索、运动噪声、偏好活动水平和生物启发的运动控制。

Result: 模型成功复现了婴儿偏好移动连接肢体的经典发现，并揭示了断开连接后偶尔的爆发性运动。

Abstract: We present a computational model of the mechanisms that may determine
infants' behavior in the "mobile paradigm". This paradigm has been used in
developmental psychology to explore how infants learn the sensory effects of
their actions. In this paradigm, a mobile (an articulated and movable object
hanging above an infant's crib) is connected to one of the infant's limbs,
prompting the infant to preferentially move that "connected" limb. This ability
to detect a "sensorimotor contingency" is considered to be a foundational
cognitive ability in development. To understand how infants learn sensorimotor
contingencies, we built a model that attempts to replicate infant behavior. Our
model incorporates a neural network, action-outcome prediction, exploration,
motor noise, preferred activity level, and biologically-inspired motor control.
We find that simulations with our model replicate the classic findings in the
literature showing preferential movement of the connected limb. An interesting
observation is that the model sometimes exhibits a burst of movement after the
mobile is disconnected, casting light on a similar occasional finding in
infants. In addition to these general findings, the simulations also replicate
data from two recent more detailed studies using a connection with the mobile
that was either gradual or all-or-none. A series of ablation studies further
shows that the inclusion of mechanisms of action-outcome prediction,
exploration, motor noise, and biologically-inspired motor control was essential
for the model to correctly replicate infant behavior. This suggests that these
components are also involved in infants' sensorimotor learning.

Abstract: The widespread integration of new technologies in low-voltage distribution
networks on the consumer side creates the need for distribution system
operators to perform advanced real-time calculations to estimate network
conditions. In recent years, data-driven models based on machine learning and
big data analysis have emerged for calculation purposes, leveraging the
information available in large datasets obtained from smart meters and other
advanced measurement infrastructure. However, existing data-driven algorithms
do not take into account the quality of data collected from smart meters. They
lack built-in anomaly detection mechanisms and fail to differentiate anomalies
based on whether the value or context of anomalous data instances deviates from
the norm. This paper focuses on methods for detecting and mitigating the impact
of anomalies on the consumption of active and reactive power datasets. It
proposes an anomaly detection framework based on the Isolation Forest machine
learning algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform filtering that works in both the
time and frequency domain and is unaffected by point anomalies or contextual
anomalies of the power consumption data. The importance of integrating anomaly
detection methods is demonstrated in the analysis important for distribution
networks with a high share of smart meters.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在部分观测的线性时不变系统中识别系统参数的新算法，适用于更广泛的噪声分布（仅需二阶矩），并展示了其样本复杂度与子高斯噪声假设下的结果相近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常假设噪声为高斯或子高斯分布，限制了实际应用。本文旨在放宽噪声假设，仅需二阶矩，以更广泛地适用于实际场景。

Method: 利用鲁棒统计工具和提升（boosting）思想，提出了一种新的系统识别算法。

Result: 算法在更弱的噪声假设下，样本复杂度与子高斯噪声假设下的结果相近，且仅需激励输入过程的四阶矩有限。

Conclusion: 该算法在放宽噪声假设的同时，仍能保持接近最优的性能，为实际系统识别提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of system identification of partially observed linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems. Given input-output data, we provide
non-asymptotic guarantees for identifying the system parameters under general
heavy-tailed noise processes. Unlike previous works that assume Gaussian or
sub-Gaussian noise, we consider significantly broader noise distributions that
are required to admit only up to the second moment. For this setting, we
leverage tools from robust statistics to propose a novel system identification
algorithm that exploits the idea of boosting. Despite the much weaker noise
assumptions, we show that our proposed algorithm achieves sample complexity
bounds that nearly match those derived under sub-Gaussian noise. In particular,
we establish that our bounds retain a logarithmic dependence on the prescribed
failure probability. Interestingly, we show that such bounds can be achieved by
requiring just a finite fourth moment on the excitatory input process.

Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to
understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools
for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial
intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on
binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a
novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose
an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein
dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface
(FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this
sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein
dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this
dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant
generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation
trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a
significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate
its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein
interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to
encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel
applications in pathway prediction.

Conclusion: 神经网络的不可区分性使其在平滑参数模型中独树一帜。

Abstract: One of the enduring problems surrounding neural networks is to identify the
factors that differentiate them from traditional statistical models. We prove a
pair of results which distinguish feedforward neural networks among parametric
models at the population level, for regression tasks. Firstly, we prove that
for any pair of random variables $(X,Y)$, neural networks always learn a
nontrivial relationship between $X$ and $Y$, if one exists. Secondly, we prove
that for reasonable smooth parametric models, under local and global
identifiability conditions, there exists a nontrivial $(X,Y)$ pair for which
the parametric model learns the constant predictor $\mathbb{E}[Y]$. Together,
our results suggest that a lack of identifiability distinguishes neural
networks among the class of smooth parametric models.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving cloud platforms and the escalating complexity of network
traffic demand proper network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection to
ensure network security and performance. This paper introduces a large language
model (LLM)-based network traffic monitoring and anomaly detection system. In
addition to existing models such as autoencoders and decision trees, we harness
the power of large language models for processing sequence data from network
traffic, which allows us a better capture of underlying complex patterns, as
well as slight fluctuations in the dataset. We show for a given detection task,
the need for a hybrid model that incorporates the attention mechanism of the
transformer architecture into a supervised learning framework in order to
achieve better accuracy. A pre-trained large language model analyzes and
predicts the probable network traffic, and an anomaly detection layer that
considers temporality and context is added. Moreover, we present a novel
transfer learning-based methodology to enhance the model's effectiveness to
quickly adapt to unknown network structures and adversarial conditions without
requiring extensive labeled datasets. Actual results show that the designed
model outperforms traditional methods in detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, effectively identify various network anomalies such as zero-day
attacks and traffic congestion pattern, and significantly reduce the false
positive rate.

Result: 在集成接入与回传（IAB）网络中，框架表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 讨论了LLM在O-RAN中应用的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to a significant
interest in deploying LLMempowered algorithms for wireless communication
networks. Meanwhile, open radio access network (O-RAN) techniques offer
unprecedented flexibility, with the non-real-time (non-RT) radio access network
(RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) (non-RT RIC) and near-real-time (near-RT)
RIC (near-RT RIC) components enabling intelligent resource management across
different time scales. In this paper, we propose the LLM empowered hierarchical
RIC (LLM-hRIC) framework to improve the collaboration between RICs. This
framework integrates LLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) for efficient
network resource management. In this framework, LLMs-empowered non-RT RICs
provide strategic guidance and high-level policies based on environmental
context. Concurrently, RL-empowered near-RT RICs perform low-latency tasks
based on strategic guidance and local near-RT observation. We evaluate the
LLM-hRIC framework in an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network setting.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior
performance. Finally, we discuss the key future challenges in applying LLMs to
O-RAN.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum field theories on lattices serve as a
fundamental tool for studying the non-perturbative regime of the theories,
where analytic tools often fall short. Challenges arise when one takes the
continuum limit or as the system approaches a critical point, especially in the
presence of non-trivial topological structures in the theory. Rapid recent
advances in machine learning provide a promising avenue for progress in this
area. These lecture notes aim to give a brief account of lattice field

former. The notes are based on the lectures given by the first author in

Abstract: Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from
exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work
studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied
reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible
platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world
game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions
of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the
primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art
agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance
dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task
completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for
multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the
need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning. Our website

Abstract: The Computer_Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems facilitate accurate diagnosis of
diseases. The development of CADs by leveraging third generation neural
network, namely, Spiking Neural Network (SNN), is essential to utilize of the
benefits of SNNs, such as their event_driven processing, parallelism, low power
consumption, and the ability to process sparse temporal_spatial information.
However, Deep SNN as a deep learning model faces challenges with unreliability.
To deal with unreliability challenges due to inability to quantify the
uncertainty of the predictions, we proposed a deep Bayesian Convolutional
Spiking Neural Network based_CADs with uncertainty_aware module. In this study,
the Monte Carlo Dropout method as Bayesian approximation is used as an
uncertainty quantification method. This method was applied to several medical

Abstract: Monitoring calf body weight (BW) before weaning is essential for assessing
growth, feed efficiency, health, and weaning readiness. However, labor, time,
and facility constraints limit BW collection. Additionally, Holstein calf coat
patterns complicate image-based BW estimation, and few studies have explored
non-contact measurements taken at early time points for predicting later BW.
The objectives of this study were to (1) develop deep learning-based
segmentation models for extracting calf body metrics, (2) compare deep learning
segmentation with threshold-based methods, and (3) evaluate BW prediction using
single-time-point cross-validation with linear regression (LR) and extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multiple-time-point cross-validation with LR,
XGBoost, and a linear mixed model (LMM). Depth images from Holstein (n = 63)
and Jersey (n = 5) pre-weaning calves were collected, with 20 Holstein calves
being weighed manually. Results showed that You Only Look Once version 8
(YOLOv8) deep learning segmentation (intersection over union = 0.98)
outperformed threshold-based methods (0.89). In single-time-point
cross-validation, XGBoost achieved the best BW prediction (R^2 = 0.91, mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 4.37%), while LMM provided the most accurate
longitudinal BW prediction (R^2 = 0.99, MAPE = 2.39%). These findings highlight
the potential of deep learning for automated BW prediction, enhancing farm

integrating Fourier Feature mappings and introducing modulation strategies into
a PINN framework. Experiments on two distinct datasets demonstrate that the

Motivation: 传统计算白质形状测量的方法计算成本高且耗时，限制了大规模数据集的分析。

Method: 提出Tract2Shape，结合几何（点云）和标量（表格）特征，利用降维算法预测五个主要形状成分。

Result: 在HCP-YA和PPMI数据集上表现优异，平均Pearson's r最高，nMSE最低，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Tract2Shape为未来大规模白质形状分析提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter
tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and
associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional
methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and
time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based
representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning
framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features
to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model
efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to
predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on
two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset.
We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the
HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To
further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test
Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep
learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average
Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows
that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the
unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low
nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation.
Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white
matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis
across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future
large-scale white matter shape analysis.

Conclusion: PhyNC提升了EIT重建的鲁棒性，并为类似问题的其他成像模态提供了灵活框架。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable
imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial
applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges:
the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable,
location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods
mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity
variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive
training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields
have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction,
but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT,
thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC
(Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework
that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the
ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically
allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity,
ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive
evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC
outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact
resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the
robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be
adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the most aggressive type of glioma, having a 5-year
survival rate of 6.9%. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and frequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans to monitor disease progression. To assess treatment response,
radiologists use the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria to
categorize the tumor into one of four labels based on imaging and clinical
features: complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive
disease. This assessment is very complex and time-consuming. Since deep
learning (DL) has been widely used to tackle classification problems, this work
aimed to implement the first DL pipeline for the classification of RANO
criteria based on two consecutive MRI acquisitions. The models were trained and
tested on the open dataset LUMIERE. Five approaches were tested: 1) subtraction
of input images, 2) different combinations of modalities, 3) different model
architectures, 4) different pretraining tasks, and 5) adding clinical data. The
pipeline that achieved the best performance used a Densenet264 considering only
T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
images as input without any pretraining. A median Balanced Accuracy of 50.96%
was achieved. Additionally, explainability methods were applied. Using Saliency
Maps, the tumor region was often successfully highlighted. In contrast,
Grad-CAM typically failed to highlight the tumor region, with some exceptions
observed in the Complete Response and Progressive Disease classes, where it
effectively identified the tumor region. These results set a benchmark for
future studies on glioblastoma treatment response assessment based on the RANO
criteria while emphasizing the heterogeneity of factors that might play a role
when assessing the tumor's response to treatment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经无符号距离场（NUDF）的医学图像分割方法，解决了传统方法在高分辨率处理中的内存问题，并能够生成高精度3D网格模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割方法在处理高分辨率图像时面临内存不足问题，且降采样会丢失细节。NUDF方法旨在解决这些问题，同时支持复杂拓扑结构的建模。

Method: 通过直接学习图像中的神经无符号距离场（NUDF），避免了传统二值体素网格的局限性，实现了高分辨率处理和连续表面建模。

Result: 在左心耳（LAA）CT图像分割任务中，NUDF方法能够生成高精度3D网格模型，精度达到体素间距级别。

Conclusion: NUDF方法为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂解剖结构的建模。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is often considered as the task of labelling each
pixel or voxel as being inside or outside a given anatomy. Processing the
images at their original size and resolution often result in insuperable memory
requirements, but downsampling the images leads to a loss of important details.
Instead of aiming to represent a smooth and continuous surface in a binary
voxel-grid, we propose to learn a Neural Unsigned Distance Field (NUDF)
directly from the image. The small memory requirements of NUDF allow for high
resolution processing, while the continuous nature of the distance field allows
us to create high resolution 3D mesh models of shapes of any topology (i.e.
open surfaces). We evaluate our method on the task of left atrial appendage
(LAA) segmentation from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The LAA is a complex
and highly variable shape, being thus difficult to represent with traditional
segmentation methods using discrete labelmaps. With our proposed method, we are
able to predict 3D mesh models that capture the details of the LAA and achieve
accuracy in the order of the voxel spacing in the CT images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分区图的快速块划分算法，用于VVC编码中的帧间编码，通过神经网络预测分区图，显著降低编码复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VVC编码中QT+MTT块结构虽提供灵活划分，但递归搜索增加了编码复杂度，需高效解决方案。

Method: 改进分区图方法，加入MTT掩码；设计神经网络，利用时空特征预测分区图；提出双阈值决策方案。

Result: 实验显示，平均节省51.30%编码时间，BDBR仅增加2.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低复杂度的同时保持了良好的率失真性能。

Abstract: Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with
nested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains
by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive
partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity
substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based
algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our
previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the
characteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by
incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural
network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition
map. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and
bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and
partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold
decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity
reduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time
saving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access
configuration.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的HBP图像合成方法，比较了三种生成模型，并评估了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HBP图像获取时间长，影响患者舒适度和扫描效率，需缩短时间。

Method: 使用U-Net、pGAN和DDPM三种模型，从早期对比阶段合成HBP图像，并引入CES评估数据质量。

Result: pGAN定量表现最佳但存在异质性，U-Net一致性更好，DDPM表现较差。

Conclusion: 合成HBP图像可行，能减少扫描时间，具有临床潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays a
crucial role in the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions, with
the hepatobiliary phase (HBP) providing essential diagnostic information.
However, acquiring HBP images requires prolonged scan times, which may
compromise patient comfort and scanner throughput. In this study, we propose a
deep learning based approach for synthesizing HBP images from earlier contrast
phases (precontrast and transitional) and compare three generative models: a
perceptual U-Net, a perceptual GAN (pGAN), and a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM). We curated a multi-site DCE-MRI dataset from
diverse clinical settings and introduced a contrast evolution score (CES) to
assess training data quality, enhancing model performance. Quantitative
evaluation using pixel-wise and perceptual metrics, combined with qualitative
assessment through blinded radiologist reviews, showed that pGAN achieved the
best quantitative performance but introduced heterogeneous contrast in
out-of-distribution cases. In contrast, the U-Net produced consistent liver
enhancement with fewer artifacts, while DDPM underperformed due to limited
preservation of fine structural details. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of synthetic HBP image generation as a means to reduce scan time
without compromising diagnostic utility, highlighting the clinical potential of
deep learning for dynamic contrast enhancement in liver MRI. A project demo is

<details>

Motivation: T2w MRI的高平面分辨率虽适合海马亚区分割，但其低平面外分辨率降低了亚区厚度测量的准确性。

Method: 创建高分辨率图谱，结合T1和T2w图像上采样，并训练多模态深度学习分割模型。

Result: 近乎各向同性的亚区分割提高了T2w MRI中皮质厚度作为神经退行性病变生物标志物的准确性。

Conclusion: 该流程显著提升了T2w MRI在神经退行性疾病研究中的应用价值。

Abstract: Morphometry of medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in brain MRI is
sensitive biomarker to Alzheimers Disease and other related conditions. While
T2-weighted (T2w) MRI with high in-plane resolution is widely used to segment
hippocampal subfields due to its higher contrast in hippocampus, its lower
out-of-plane resolution reduces the accuracy of subregion thickness
measurements. To address this issue, we developed a nearly isotropic
segmentation pipeline that incorporates image and label upsampling and
high-resolution segmentation in T2w MRI. First, a high-resolution atlas was
created based on an existing anisotropic atlas derived from 29 individuals.
Both T1-weighted and T2w images in the atlas were upsampled from their original
resolution to a nearly isotropic resolution 0.4x0.4x0.52mm3 using a non-local
means approach. Manual segmentations within the atlas were also upsampled to
match this resolution using a UNet-based neural network, which was trained on a
cohort consisting of both high-resolution ex vivo and low-resolution
anisotropic in vivo MRI with manual segmentations. Second, a multi-modality
deep learning-based segmentation model was trained within this nearly isotropic
atlas. Finally, experiments showed the nearly isotropic subregion segmentation
improved the accuracy of cortical thickness as an imaging biomarker for
neurodegeneration in T2w MRI.

Conclusion: RSFR具有鲁棒性、可扩展性和临床转化潜力，为心脏DTI的定量分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers unique insights into
cardiomyocyte arrangements, bridging the gap between microscopic and
macroscopic cardiac function. However, its clinical utility is limited by
technical challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio, aliasing
artefacts, and the need for accurate quantitative fidelity. To address these
limitations, we introduce RSFR (Reconstruction, Segmentation, Fusion &
Refinement), a novel framework for cardiac diffusion-weighted image
reconstruction. RSFR employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, leveraging zero-shot
semantic priors via the Segment Anything Model and a robust Vision Mamba-based
reconstruction backbone. Our framework integrates semantic features effectively
to mitigate artefacts and enhance fidelity, achieving state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and accurate DT parameter estimation under high
undersampling rates. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the
superior performance of RSFR compared to existing methods, highlighting its
robustness, scalability, and potential for clinical translation in quantitative
cardiac DTI.

Motivation: 在多任务学习中，潜在右因子向量的推断具有挑战性，因为左右奇异向量不对称，现有方法难以直接适用。

Method: 提出了两种SOFARI-R变体：一种处理强正交因子，通过耦合左奇异向量与设计矩阵并重新缩放；另一种处理弱正交因子，结合硬阈值估计和近似误差。

Result: 两种变体均生成偏差校正的估计量，具有渐近正态分布和合理的渐近方差估计。

Conclusion: SOFARI-R方法在模拟研究和经济应用中表现出有效性，解决了潜在右因子向量推断的问题。

Abstract: Data reduction with uncertainty quantification plays a key role in various
multi-task learning applications, where large numbers of responses and features
are present. To this end, a general framework of high-dimensional
manifold-based SOFAR inference (SOFARI) was introduced recently in Zheng, Zhou,
Fan and Lv (2024) for interpretable multi-task learning inference focusing on
the left factor vectors and singular values exploiting the latent singular
value decomposition (SVD) structure. Yet, designing a valid inference procedure
on the latent right factor vectors is not straightforward from that of the left
ones and can be even more challenging due to asymmetry of left and right
singular vectors in the response matrix. To tackle these issues, in this paper
we suggest a new method of high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference for
latent responses (SOFARI-R), where two variants of SOFARI-R are introduced. The
first variant deals with strongly orthogonal factors by coupling left singular
vectors with the design matrix and then appropriately rescaling them to
generate new Stiefel manifolds. The second variant handles the more general
weakly orthogonal factors by employing the hard-thresholded SOFARI estimates
and delicately incorporating approximation errors into the distribution. Both
variants produce bias-corrected estimators for the latent right factor vectors
that enjoy asymptotically normal distributions with justified asymptotic
variance estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly suggested
method using extensive simulation studies and an economic application.

Result: 实验表明，crypto-ncRNA在效率和可扩展性上优于RSA，且通过NIST随机性测试。

Conclusion: crypto-ncRNA为应对量子计算威胁提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In the looming post-quantum era, traditional cryptographic systems are
increasingly vulnerable to quantum computing attacks that can compromise their
mathematical foundations. To address this critical challenge, we propose
crypto-ncRNA-a bio-convergent cryptographic framework that leverages the
dynamic folding properties of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) to generate high-entropy,
quantum-resistant keys and produce unpredictable ciphertexts. The framework
employs a novel, multi-stage process: encoding plaintext into RNA sequences,
predicting and manipulating RNA secondary structures using advanced algorithms,
and deriving cryptographic keys through the intrinsic physical unclonability of
RNA molecules. Experimental evaluations indicate that, although crypto-ncRNA's
encryption speed is marginally lower than that of AES, it significantly
outperforms RSA in terms of efficiency and scalability while achieving a 100%
pass rate on the NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests. These results demonstrate
that crypto-ncRNA offers a promising and robust approach for securing digital
infrastructures against the evolving threats posed by quantum computing.

Abstract: Digital systems find it challenging to keep up with cybersecurity threats.
The daily emergence of more than 560,000 new malware strains poses significant
hazards to the digital ecosystem. The traditional malware detection methods
fail to operate properly and yield high false positive rates with low accuracy
of the protection system. This study explores the ways in which malware can be
detected using these machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to
address those shortcomings. This study also includes a systematic comparison of
the performance of some of the widely used ML models, such as random forest,
multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and deep neural network (DNN), for determining
the effectiveness of the domain of modern malware threat systems. We use a
considerable-sized database from Kaggle, which has undergone optimized feature
selection and preprocessing to improve model performance. Our finding suggests
that the DNN model outperformed the other traditional models with the highest
training accuracy of 99.92% and an almost perfect AUC score. Furthermore, the
feature selection and preprocessing can help improve the capabilities of
detection. This research makes an important contribution by analyzing the
performance of the model on the performance metrics and providing insight into
the effectiveness of the advanced detection techniques to build more robust and

Abstract: Phishing detection on Ethereum has increasingly leveraged advanced machine

and contrasting explicit transactional features and implicit graph-based
features, both experimentally and analytically. We explore how different
feature sets impact the performance of phishing detection models, particularly
in the context of Ethereum's transactional network. Additionally, we address
key challenges such as class imbalance and dataset composition and their
influence on the robustness and precision of detection methods. Our findings

Result: DiffUMI在隐私保护人脸识别系统中取得先进成果，并首次利用模型反演区分非人脸输入。

Conclusion: DiffUMI展示了扩散模型在模型反演中的潜力，为隐私风险评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology poses significant privacy risks, as it relies
on biometric data that is inherently sensitive and immutable if compromised. To
mitigate these concerns, face recognition systems convert raw images into
embeddings, traditionally considered privacy-preserving. However, model
inversion attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing these
private facial images, making them a crucial tool for evaluating the privacy
risks of face recognition systems. Existing methods usually require training
individual generators for each target model, a computationally expensive
process. In this paper, we propose DiffUMI, a training-free diffusion-driven
universal model inversion attack for face recognition systems. DiffUMI is the
first approach to apply a diffusion model for unconditional image generation in
model inversion. Unlike other methods, DiffUMI is universal, eliminating the
need for training target-specific generators. It operates within a fixed
framework and pretrained diffusion model while seamlessly adapting to diverse
target identities and models. DiffUMI breaches privacy-preserving face
recognition systems with state-of-the-art success, demonstrating that an
unconditional diffusion model, coupled with optimized adversarial search,
enables efficient and high-fidelity facial reconstruction. Additionally, we
introduce a novel application of out-of-domain detection (OODD), marking the
first use of model inversion to distinguish non-face inputs from face inputs
based solely on embeddings.

Conclusion: NoEsis在隐私保护与知识共享间取得平衡，为模块化大语言模型提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are typically trained on vast amounts of data
from various sources. Even when designed modularly (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts),
LLMs can leak privacy on their sources. Conversely, training such models in
isolation arguably prohibits generalization. To this end, we propose a
framework, NoEsis, which builds upon the desired properties of modularity,
privacy, and knowledge transfer. NoEsis integrates differential privacy with a
hybrid two-staged parameter-efficient fine-tuning that combines domain-specific
low-rank adapters, acting as experts, with common prompt tokens, acting as a
knowledge-sharing backbone. Results from our evaluation on CodeXGLUE showcase
that NoEsis can achieve provable privacy guarantees with tangible knowledge
transfer across domains, and empirically show protection against Membership
Inference Attacks. Finally, on code completion tasks, NoEsis bridges at least
77% of the accuracy gap between the non-shared and the non-private baseline.

Abstract: Despite the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across
various sectors, cyber security continues to rely on traditional static and
dynamic analysis tools, hampered by high false positive rates and superficial
code comprehension. While generative AI offers promising automation
capabilities for software development, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
for vulnerability detection presents unique challenges. This paper explores the
potential and limitations of LLMs in identifying vulnerabilities, acknowledging
inherent weaknesses such as hallucinations, limited context length, and
knowledge cut-offs. Previous attempts employing machine learning models for
vulnerability detection have proven ineffective due to limited real-world
applicability, feature engineering challenges, lack of contextual
understanding, and the complexities of training models to keep pace with the
evolving threat landscape. Therefore, we propose a robust AI-driven approach
focused on mitigating these limitations and ensuring the quality and
reliability of LLM based vulnerability detection. Through innovative
methodologies combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
Mixtureof-Agents (MoA), this research seeks to leverage the strengths of LLMs
while addressing their weaknesses, ultimately paving the way for dependable and
efficient AI-powered solutions in securing the ever-evolving software

Motivation: 现有攻击方法主要针对机器学习模型或合成数据，缺乏针对固定聚合统计数据的评估方法。

Method: 提出DeSIA攻击框架，并在不同噪声水平和统计量下测试其性能。

Result: DeSIA在低误报率下表现出高真阳性率，且对无法验证属性的用户也有效。

Conclusion: 仅靠聚合不足以保护隐私，需结合正式隐私机制和测试。

Abstract: Empirical inference attacks are a popular approach for evaluating the privacy
risk of data release mechanisms in practice. While an active attack literature
exists to evaluate machine learning models or synthetic data release, we
currently lack comparable methods for fixed aggregate statistics, in particular
when only a limited number of statistics are released. We here propose an
inference attack framework against fixed aggregate statistics and an attribute
inference attack called DeSIA. We instantiate DeSIA against the U.S. Census
PPMF dataset and show it to strongly outperform reconstruction-based attacks.
In particular, we show DeSIA to be highly effective at identifying vulnerable
users, achieving a true positive rate of 0.14 at a false positive rate of
$10^{-3}$. We then show DeSIA to perform well against users whose attributes
cannot be verified and when varying the number of aggregate statistics and
level of noise addition. We also perform an extensive ablation study of DeSIA
and show how DeSIA can be successfully adapted to the membership inference
task. Overall, our results show that aggregation alone is not sufficient to
protect privacy, even when a relatively small number of aggregates are being
released, and emphasize the need for formal privacy mechanisms and testing
before aggregate statistics are released.

Abstract: While analysing challenges in pilot projects developing AI with marginalized

ground AI development in the social fabric -- the Cloud Weaving Model --

TL;DR: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）在GeoAI中推动创新，但需平衡安全、伦理与治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开源LLMs在GeoAI中的潜力与挑战，强调其定制化、透明性和社区驱动的优势。

Method: 分析开源与专有LLMs的差异，结合GIScience需求提出多样化生态系统。

Result: 开源LLMs促进地理信息科学的适应性、可重复性和创新，但需应对安全与伦理问题。

Conclusion: GIScience应发展多样化、可互操作的LLM生态系统，以负责任的方式推动空间研究与决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming geospatial artificial
intelligence (GeoAI), offering new capabilities in data processing, spatial
analysis, and decision support. This paper examines the open-source paradigm's
pivotal role in this transformation. While proprietary LLMs offer
accessibility, they often limit the customization, interoperability, and
transparency vital for specialized geospatial tasks. Conversely, open-source
alternatives significantly advance Geographic Information Science (GIScience)
by fostering greater adaptability, reproducibility, and community-driven
innovation. Open frameworks empower researchers to tailor solutions, integrate
cutting-edge methodologies (e.g., reinforcement learning, advanced spatial
indexing), and align with FAIR principles. However, the growing reliance on any
LLM necessitates careful consideration of security vulnerabilities, ethical
risks, and robust governance for AI-generated geospatial outputs. Ongoing
debates on accessibility, regulation, and misuse underscore the critical need
for responsible AI development strategies. This paper argues that GIScience
advances best not through a single model type, but by cultivating a diverse,
interoperable ecosystem combining open-source foundations for innovation,
bespoke geospatial models, and interdisciplinary collaboration. By critically
evaluating the opportunities and challenges of open-source LLMs within the
broader GeoAI landscape, this work contributes to a nuanced discourse on
leveraging AI to effectively advance spatial research, policy, and
decision-making in an equitable, sustainable, and scientifically rigorous
manner.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如人脸恢复、背景减除等）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和计算效率上均有提升，适用于多种噪声模式。

Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is a fundamental technique
for decomposing multi-dimensional data into a low-rank tensor and an outlier
tensor, yet existing methods relying on sparse outlier assumptions often fail
under structured corruptions. In this paper, we propose a self-guided data
augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier
influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor
Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an
optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and
downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an
efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates
to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency.
Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block
coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery,
background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our
method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the
improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators
(PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by
high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural
Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse)
orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis,
the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational
efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we
established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as
Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's
performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear
Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.

Abstract: Speech production is a complex sequential process which involve the
coordination of various articulatory features. Among them tongue being a highly

targeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper
presents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights
initialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of
simultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)
datasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin,
linguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The

Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights
approach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进局部最优网络（LONs）分析的方法，通过结合子函数信息（已知或学习获得）来丰富优化动态的洞察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LONs构建和分析未利用问题结构信息，限制了其分析效果。

Method: 采用三种方法构建LONs：标准算法、基于确定性灰箱交叉的算法，以及基于学习变量交互的扰动选择算法。

Result: 结合问题结构的LONs分析能提供更丰富的优化动态信息，有助于理解问题求解难度。

Conclusion: 建议在已知或疑似子函数结构的问题中，将问题结构纳入LONs分析的范式。

Abstract: Local optima networks (LONs) capture fitness landscape information. They are
typically constructed in a black-box manner; information about the problem
structure is not utilised. This also applies to the analysis of LONs: knowledge
about the problem, such as interaction between variables, is not considered. We
challenge this status-quo with an alternative approach: we consider how LON
analysis can be improved by incorporating subfunction-based information - this
can either be known a-priori or learned during search. To this end, LONs are
constructed for several benchmark pseudo-boolean problems using three
approaches: firstly, the standard algorithm; a second algorithm which uses
deterministic grey-box crossover; and a third algorithm which selects
perturbations based on learned information about variable interactions. Metrics
related to subfunction changes in a LON are proposed and compared with metrics
from previous literature which capture other aspects of a LON. Incorporating
problem structure in LON construction and analysing it can bring enriched
insight into optimisation dynamics. Such information may be crucial to
understanding the difficulty of solving a given problem with state-of-the-art
linkage learning optimisers. In light of the results, we suggest incorporation
of problem structure as an alternative paradigm in landscape analysis for
problems with known or suspected subfunction structure.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，还具有良好的泛化能力，并能与现有参数调优方法互补。

Abstract: Optimization algorithms are widely employed to tackle complex problems, but
designing them manually is often labor-intensive and requires significant
expertise. Global placement is a fundamental step in electronic design
automation (EDA). While analytical approaches represent the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) in global placement, their core optimization algorithms remain heavily
dependent on heuristics and customized components, such as initialization
strategies, preconditioning methods, and line search techniques. This paper
presents an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLM) to
evolve optimization algorithms for global placement. We first generate diverse
candidate algorithms using LLM through carefully crafted prompts. Then we
introduce an LLM-based genetic flow to evolve selected candidate algorithms.
The discovered optimization algorithms exhibit substantial performance
improvements across many benchmarks. Specifically, Our design-case-specific
discovered algorithms achieve average HPWL improvements of \textbf{5.05\%},
\text{5.29\%} and \textbf{8.30\%} on MMS, ISPD2005 and ISPD2019 benchmarks, and
up to \textbf{17\%} improvements on individual cases. Additionally, the
discovered algorithms demonstrate good generalization ability and are
complementary to existing parameter-tuning methods.

Conclusion: EDNAG结合进化策略和扩散模型，实现了高效、无需训练的架构生成，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its
transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and
complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs.
Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a
generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures
for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion
models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by
high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose
Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel
approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation.
EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in
diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian
distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the
strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and
effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with
an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need
for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50
times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

dynamic switch mechanism that governs the selective activation and training of
individual neurons based on input characteristics, allowing neurons to
specialize in distinct segments of the data domain. This approach enables
neurons to learn from disjoint subsets of data, mimicking biological brain
function by promoting task specialization and improving the interpretability of

federated learning and decentralized training for real-world AI deployments,
particularly in edge computing and distributed environments. By simulating
localized training on non-overlapping data subsets, we demonstrate how modular

Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional
Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs
scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block
Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on
combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of
communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges,
we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense
IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity
lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its
size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on
the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on
the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity
lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG
representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node
classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion,
while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes
rather than edges.

filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of
interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution
of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are
robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. This shortcoming is addressed
by approximating the mean-field evolution using a novel form of neural operator
taking probability distributions as input: a Measure Neural Mapping (MNM). A
MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble
filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-fieldlimit and for
interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses
empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set
transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for
different ensemble sizes. The derivation of methods from a mean-field
formulation allows a single parameterization of the algorithm to be deployed at
different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of
parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the
scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior
root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the
Lorenz 96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.

Result: 在预测和估计误差上提供了维度无关的收敛分析，证明了收敛速率接近最优，并提出了高概率误差界的新技术。

Conclusion: 正则化SGD算法在非线性算子估计中表现优异，未来可扩展到更一般的算子值核和编码器-解码器框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
algorithms for estimating nonlinear operators from a Polish space to a
separable Hilbert space. We assume that the regression operator lies in a
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued
kernel. Two significant settings are considered: an online setting with
polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, and a
finite-horizon setting with constant step sizes and regularization parameters.
We introduce regularity conditions on the structure and smoothness of the
target operator and the input random variables. Under these conditions, we
provide a dimension-free convergence analysis for the prediction and estimation
errors, deriving both expectation and high-probability error bounds. Our
analysis demonstrates that these convergence rates are nearly optimal.
Furthermore, we present a new technique for deriving bounds with high
probability for general SGD schemes, which also ensures almost-sure
convergence. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to more general
operator-valued kernels and the encoder-decoder framework.

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) for high-dimensional regression (HDR) is an important
problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited sample size
in the target task. However, there currently lacks a method to quantify the
statistical significance of the relationship between features and the response
in TL-HDR settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical inference
framework for assessing the reliability of feature selection in TL-HDR, called
PTL-SI (Post-TL Statistical Inference). The core contribution of PTL-SI is its
ability to provide valid $p$-values to features selected in TL-HDR, thereby
rigorously controlling the false positive rate (FPR) at desired significance
level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05). Furthermore, we enhance statistical power by
incorporating a strategic divide-and-conquer approach into our framework. We
demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed PTL-SI through
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
datasets, confirming its theoretical properties and utility in testing the
reliability of feature selection in TL scenarios.

Abstract: We study the problem of distributed multi-view representation learning. In
this problem, $K$ agents observe each one distinct, possibly statistically
correlated, view and independently extracts from it a suitable representation
in a manner that a decoder that gets all $K$ representations estimates
correctly the hidden label. In the absence of any explicit coordination between
the agents, a central question is: what should each agent extract from its view
that is necessary and sufficient for a correct estimation at the decoder? In
this paper, we investigate this question from a generalization error
perspective. First, we establish several generalization bounds in terms of the
relative entropy between the distribution of the representations extracted from
training and "test" datasets and a data-dependent symmetric prior, i.e., the
Minimum Description Length (MDL) of the latent variables for all views and
training and test datasets. Then, we use the obtained bounds to devise a
regularizer; and investigate in depth the question of the selection of a
suitable prior. In particular, we show and conduct experiments that illustrate
that our data-dependent Gaussian mixture priors with judiciously chosen weights
lead to good performance. For single-view settings (i.e., $K=1$), our
experimental results are shown to outperform existing prior art Variational
Information Bottleneck (VIB) and Category-Dependent VIB (CDVIB) approaches.
Interestingly, we show that a weighted attention mechanism emerges naturally in
this setting. Finally, for the multi-view setting, we show that the selection
of the joint prior as a Gaussians product mixture induces a Gaussian mixture
marginal prior for each marginal view and implicitly encourages the agents to
extract and output redundant features, a finding which is somewhat
counter-intuitive.

Abstract: Functional survival models are key tools for analyzing time-to-event data
with complex predictors, such as functional or high-dimensional inputs. Despite
their predictive strength, these models often lack interpretability, which
limits their value in practical decision-making and risk analysis. This study
investigates two key survival models: the Functional Survival Tree (FST) and
the Functional Random Survival Forest (FRSF). It introduces novel methods and
tools to enhance the interpretability of FST models and improve the
explainability of FRSF ensembles. Using both real and simulated datasets, the
results demonstrate that the proposed approaches yield efficient,
easy-to-understand decision trees that accurately capture the underlying
decision-making processes of the model ensemble.

Abstract: We consider the problem of modelling the effects of unseen perturbations such
as gene knockdowns or drug combinations on low-level measurements such as RNA
sequencing data. Specifically, given data collected under some perturbations,
we aim to predict the distribution of measurements for new perturbations. To
address this challenging extrapolation task, we posit that perturbations act
additively in a suitable, unknown embedding space. More precisely, we formulate
the generative process underlying the observed data as a latent variable model,
in which perturbations amount to mean shifts in latent space and can be
combined additively. Unlike previous work, we prove that, given sufficiently
diverse training perturbations, the representation and perturbation effects are
identifiable up to affine transformation, and use this to characterize the
class of unseen perturbations for which we obtain extrapolation guarantees. To
estimate the model from data, we propose a new method, the perturbation
distribution autoencoder (PDAE), which is trained by maximising the
distributional similarity between true and predicted perturbation
distributions. The trained model can then be used to predict previously unseen
perturbation distributions. Empirical evidence suggests that PDAE compares
favourably to existing methods and baselines at predicting the effects of
unseen perturbations.

TL;DR: iVR-GS是一种新型NVS方法，通过高斯点渲染降低渲染成本，支持场景编辑，提升体积数据的交互探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NVS方法在渲染速度和硬件需求上有优势，但场景可见部分受预设TF限制，限制了用户探索。

Method: 通过组合多个与基本TF关联的iVR-GS模型，覆盖整个体积场景，每个模型包含可编辑的3D高斯点。

Result: iVR-GS在多种体积数据集上展示了优于其他NVS方法的重建质量和可组合性。

Conclusion: iVR-GS在降低渲染成本的同时，实现了交互式体积探索和场景编辑。

Abstract: In volume visualization, users can interactively explore the
three-dimensional data by specifying color and opacity mappings in the transfer
function (TF) or adjusting lighting parameters, facilitating meaningful
interpretation of the underlying structure. However, rendering large-scale
volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time
performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster
rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a
reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings,
significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume
rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that
reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume
exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with
basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene
visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where
each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and
editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability
of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on
various volume datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 研究提供了可解释的闭式表达式，捕捉了Dst演化中的非线性依赖和阈值效应，为地磁暴预测提供了新工具。

Abstract: Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere
driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and
ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies
geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This
study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing
the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA
OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective
electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an
evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify
mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting
models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with
well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and
O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models
demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate
geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance
evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the
2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide
interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and
thresholding effects in Dst evolution.

Motivation: 探索预训练LLMs在多步推理和代码生成中的潜力，解决个性化编程任务。

Method: 结合概念教学、端到端代码开发、递归提示驱动方法和有限人工干预的调试。

Result: 在20个场景的基准测试中，EduBot能在20分钟内完成大部分任务，并验证了其在不同LLMs上的兼容性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EduBot展示了预训练LLMs在复杂编程任务中的潜力，为个性化学习和代码生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing the process
of writing code. General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in
generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot
queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with
recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we
propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines
conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized
programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited
human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated
programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging
from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven
systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's
performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios
in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that
EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the
benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the
backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with
varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to
explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code
generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and
code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络协议实现的正确性验证存在oracle和traceability问题，现有方法很少同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 利用LLMs将RFC文档翻译为形式化协议消息规范，作为quasi-oracle验证协议解析器，并通过验证结果逐步优化oracle。

Result: 在9个网络协议及其C、Python和Go实现中，检测到69个bug（36个已确认），性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于自然语言规范自动化软件验证的潜力，减少了传统手动验证的需求。

Abstract: Validating the correctness of network protocol implementations is highly
challenging due to the oracle and traceability problems. The former determines
when a protocol implementation can be considered buggy, especially when the
bugs do not cause any observable symptoms. The latter allows developers to
understand how an implementation violates the protocol specification, thereby
facilitating bug fixes. Unlike existing works that rarely take both problems
into account, this work considers both and provides an effective solution using
recent advances in large language models (LLMs). Our key observation is that
network protocols are often released with structured specification documents,
a.k.a. RFC documents, which can be systematically translated to formal protocol
message specifications via LLMs. Such specifications, which may contain errors
due to the hallucination of LLMs, are used as a quasi-oracle to validate
protocol parsers, while the validation results in return gradually refine the
oracle. Since the oracle is derived from the document, any bugs we find in a
protocol implementation can be traced back to the document, thus addressing the
traceability problem. We have extensively evaluated our approach using nine
network protocols and their implementations written in C, Python, and Go. The
results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art and has
detected 69 bugs, with 36 confirmed. The project also demonstrates the
potential for fully automating software validation based on natural language
specifications, a process previously considered predominantly manual due to the
need to understand specification documents and derive expected outputs for test
inputs.

Result: 智能体数量随代码复杂度变化，简单问题仅需一个智能体，复杂问题需更多，平均改进11%。

Conclusion: 自适应设计效果显著，未来研究方向为提升智能体自主规划和执行能力。

Abstract: Using multiple agents was found to improve the debugging capabilities of
Large Language Models. However, increasing the number of LLM-agents has several
drawbacks such as increasing the running costs and rising the risk for the
agents to lose focus. In this work, we propose an adaptive agentic design,
where the number of agents and their roles are determined dynamically based on
the characteristics of the task to be achieved. In this design, the agents
roles are not predefined, but are generated after analyzing the problem to be
solved. Our initial evaluation shows that, with the adaptive design, the number
of agents that are generated depends on the complexity of the buggy code. In
fact, for simple code with mere syntax issues, the problem was usually fixed
using one agent only. However, for more complex problems, we noticed the
creation of a higher number of agents. Regarding the effectiveness of the fix,
we noticed an average improvement of 11% compared to the one-shot prompting.
Given these promising results, we outline future research directions to improve
our design for adaptive software agents that can autonomously plan and conduct
their software goals.

Result: 框架能够高效地将几何数据转化为可操作知识，支持复杂3D环境中的空间推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为XR应用提供了可扩展且技术无关的空间推理能力，并促进了空间本体论的创建。

Abstract: Modern extended reality XR systems provide rich analysis of image data and
fusion of sensor input and demand AR/VR applications that can reason about 3D
scenes in a semantic manner. We present a spatial reasoning framework that
bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key
tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on',
'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box
representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging
from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in
a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial
knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model,
enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client-
and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to
efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring
scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D
environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of
spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches
machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR
applications.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) applications are transforming software engineering by

investigates the adoption of GenAI coding assistants (e.g., Codeium, Amazon Q)
within telecommunications and FinTech domains. Through surveys and interviews
with industrial domain-experts, we identify primary productivity-influencing
factors, including task complexity, coding skills, domain knowledge, and GenAI
integration. Our findings indicate that GenAI tools enhance productivity in
routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face
challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited
context-awareness of codebases and insufficient support for customized design
rules. We highlight new paradigms for coding transfer, emphasizing iterative
prompt refinement, immersive development environment, and automated code
evaluation as essential for effective GenAI usage.

Result: 实验验证了新方法在性能和计算效率上的优势，并在机器人任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 基于流匹配的遍历覆盖方法扩展了可用度量，提高了性能和鲁棒性，适用于复杂动态和非平滑分布。

Abstract: Ergodic coverage effectively generates exploratory behaviors for embodied
agents by aligning the spatial distribution of the agent's trajectory with a
target distribution, where the difference between these two distributions is
measured by the ergodic metric. However, existing ergodic coverage methods are
constrained by the limited set of ergodic metrics available for control
synthesis, fundamentally limiting their performance. In this work, we propose
an alternative approach to ergodic coverage based on flow matching, a technique
widely used in generative inference for efficient and scalable sampling. We
formally derive the flow matching problem for ergodic coverage and show that it
is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator problem with a closed-form
solution. Our formulation enables alternative ergodic metrics from generative
inference that overcome the limitations of existing ones. These metrics were
previously infeasible for control synthesis but can now be supported with no
computational overhead. Specifically, flow matching with the Stein variational
gradient flow enables control synthesis directly over the score function of the
target distribution, improving robustness to the unnormalized distributions; on
the other hand, flow matching with the Sinkhorn divergence flow enables an
optimal transport-based ergodic metric, improving coverage performance on
non-smooth distributions with irregular supports. We validate the improved
performance and competitive computational efficiency of our method through
comprehensive numerical benchmarks and across different nonlinear dynamics. We
further demonstrate the practicality of our method through a series of drawing
and erasing tasks on a Franka robot.

Motivation: 传统方法假设任务级动作可简化为运动规划，但实际需要更复杂的闭环控制器。

Method: 通过CIPs将非组合预学习技能集成到分层规划中。

Result: 实验验证了移动机械臂能有效结合运动规划和通用技能完成复杂任务。

Conclusion: TASP方法通过CIPs扩展了传统任务和运动规划的能力。

Abstract: Task and motion planning is a well-established approach for solving
long-horizon robot planning problems. However, traditional methods assume that
each task-level robot action, or skill, can be reduced to kinematic motion
planning. In this work, we address the challenge of planning with both
kinematic skills and closed-loop motor controllers that go beyond kinematic
considerations. We propose a novel method that integrates these controllers
into motion planning using Composable Interaction Primitives (CIPs), enabling
the use of diverse, non-composable pre-learned skills in hierarchical robot
planning. Toward validating our Task and Skill Planning (TASP) approach, we
describe ongoing robot experiments in real-world scenarios designed to
demonstrate how CIPs can allow a mobile manipulator robot to effectively
combine motion planning with general-purpose skills to accomplish complex
tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous system simulation platforms have significantly
enhanced the safe and scalable testing of driving policies. However, existing
simulators do not yet fully meet the needs of future transportation research,
particularly in modeling socially-aware driving agents and enabling effective
human-AI collaboration. This paper introduces Sky-Drive, a novel distributed
multi-agent simulation platform that addresses these limitations through four
key innovations: (a) a distributed architecture for synchronized simulation
across multiple terminals; (b) a multi-modal human-in-the-loop framework
integrating diverse sensors to collect rich behavioral data; (c) a human-AI
collaboration mechanism supporting continuous and adaptive knowledge exchange;
and (d) a digital twin (DT) framework for constructing high-fidelity virtual
replicas of real-world transportation environments. Sky-Drive supports diverse
applications such as autonomous vehicle (AV)-vulnerable road user (VRU)
interaction modeling, human-in-the-loop training, socially-aware reinforcement
learning, personalized driving policy, and customized scenario generation.
Future extensions will incorporate foundation models for context-aware decision
support and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing for real-world validation. By
bridging scenario generation, data collection, algorithm training, and hardware
integration, Sky-Drive has the potential to become a foundational platform for
the next generation of socially-aware and human-centered autonomous
transportation research. The demo video and code are available

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为OCP的方法，通过结合本地模型和云端模型，解决了自动驾驶车辆在开放场景中的导航问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案要么泛化能力不足，要么资源消耗大，而协作方法的关键挑战在于何时以及如何调用大模型。

Method: 提出了OCP框架，包括LVM-MPC（利用云端大模型进行感知和决策）和CTO（优化协作时机）。

Result: 实验表明，OCP在导航时间和成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OCP通过智能协作本地和云端模型，有效提升了自动驾驶导航性能。

Abstract: Navigating autonomous vehicles in open scenarios is a challenge due to the
difficulties in handling unseen objects. Existing solutions either rely on
small models that struggle with generalization or large models that are
resource-intensive. While collaboration between the two offers a promising
solution, the key challenge is deciding when and how to engage the large model.
To address this issue, this paper proposes opportunistic collaborative planning
(OCP), which seamlessly integrates efficient local models with powerful cloud
models through two key innovations. First, we propose large vision model guided
model predictive control (LVM-MPC), which leverages the cloud for LVM
perception and decision making. The cloud output serves as a global guidance
for a local MPC, thereby forming a closed-loop perception-to-control system.
Second, to determine the best timing for large model query and service, we
propose collaboration timing optimization (CTO), including object detection
confidence thresholding (ODCT) and cloud forward simulation (CFS), to decide
when to seek cloud assistance and when to offer cloud service. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed OCP outperforms existing methods in terms of
both navigation time and success rate.

Motivation: 浅水环境中自主水面车辆的导航因动态干扰和深度限制而困难，传统方法在传感器信息有限的情况下难以实现安全高效操作。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在浅水环境中提高导航性能并确保安全的能力，同时实现了有效的仿真到现实的迁移。

Conclusion: 该框架为自主水面车辆在复杂浅水环境中的导航提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) play a crucial role in maritime
operations, yet their navigation in shallow-water environments remains
challenging due to dynamic disturbances and depth constraints. Traditional
navigation strategies struggle with limited sensor information, making safe and
efficient operation difficult. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement
learning (RL) framework for ASV navigation under depth constraints, where the
vehicle must reach a target while avoiding unsafe areas with only a single
depth measurement per timestep from a downward-facing Single Beam Echosounder
(SBES). To enhance environmental awareness, we integrate Gaussian Process (GP)
regression into the RL framework, enabling the agent to progressively estimate
a bathymetric depth map from sparse sonar readings. This approach improves
decision-making by providing a richer representation of the environment.
Furthermore, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer, ensuring that
trained policies generalize well to real-world aquatic conditions. Experimental
results validate our method's capability to improve ASV navigation performance
while maintaining safety in challenging shallow-water environments.

Motivation: 传统的视觉模仿学习仅模仿人类行为，而忽略了行为背后的决策特征，导致机器人在环境变化时表现不佳。

Method: 提出CIVIL算法，利用人类标记和语言提示提取因果关系特征，并训练基于Transformer的策略。

Result: 实验表明，CIVIL能减少演示需求并在新场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CIVIL通过理解人类决策特征，显著提升了机器人的学习效率和适应性。

Abstract: Today's robots learn new tasks by imitating human examples. However, this
standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the
robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those
behaviors. Without understanding the features that factor into the human's
decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the data and fail to perform the
task when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective:
instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should
take, we also enable humans to indicate task-relevant features using markers
and language prompts. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented
data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature
representation that causally informs human actions. CIVIL then applies these
causal features to train a transformer-based policy that emulates human
behaviors without being confused by visual distractors. Our simulations,
real-world experiments, and user study demonstrate that robots trained with
CIVIL can learn from fewer human demonstrations and perform better than
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in previously unseen scenarios. See

Result: 框架在分布外场景下仍能提供可靠的物理信息预测。

Conclusion: PnP-PIML框架通过结合数据驱动和物理模型，有效提升了预测的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: The ability to predict trajectories of surrounding agents and obstacles is a
crucial component in many robotic applications. Data-driven approaches are
commonly adopted for state prediction in scenarios where the underlying
dynamics are unknown. However, the performance, reliability, and uncertainty of
data-driven predictors become compromised when encountering out-of-distribution
observations relative to the training data. In this paper, we introduce a
Plug-and-Play Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PnP-PIML) framework to address
this challenge. Our method employs conformal prediction to identify outlier
dynamics and, in that case, switches from a nominal predictor to a
physics-consistent model, namely distributed Port-Hamiltonian systems (dPHS).
We leverage Gaussian processes to model the energy function of the dPHS,
enabling not only the learning of system dynamics but also the quantification
of predictive uncertainty through its Bayesian nature. In this way, the
proposed framework produces reliable physics-informed predictions even for the
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Continual learning in robotics seeks systems that can constantly adapt to
changing environments and tasks, mirroring human adaptability. A key challenge
is refining dynamics models, essential for planning and control, while
addressing issues such as safe adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, outlier
management, data efficiency, and balancing exploration with exploitation -- all
within task and onboard resource constraints. Towards this goal, we introduce a
generative framework leveraging flow matching for online robot dynamics model
alignment. Rather than executing actions based on a misaligned model, our
approach refines planned actions to better match with those the robot would
take if its model was well aligned. We find that by transforming the actions
themselves rather than exploring with a misaligned model -- as is traditionally
done -- the robot collects informative data more efficiently, thereby
accelerating learning. Moreover, we validate that the method can handle an
evolving and possibly imperfect model while reducing, if desired, the
dependency on replay buffers or legacy model snapshots. We validate our
approach using two platforms: an unmanned ground vehicle and a quadrotor. The
results highlight the method's adaptability and efficiency, with a record
34.2\% higher task success rate, demonstrating its potential towards enabling
continual robot learning. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QoS指标（如带宽、延迟）不足以提升OTT平台的用户体验，需探索新的方法。

Method: 通过分析质量切换与信道指标的关系，使用传统ML分类器进行预测。

Result: 仅使用RSRP、RSRQ和SNR，ML分类器达到77%的准确率。

Conclusion: 在5G时代，该方法可优化OTT服务，提升用户体验。

Abstract: The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a
video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube
reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift
events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is
frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts
ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion
score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve
continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are
looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on
traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and
throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting
in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our
findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts.
Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming
sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more
resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML)
classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP,
RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency
networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can
be used to improve OTT services.

Result: 发现数据共享的两大障碍：数据内嵌关键知识且资源密集，以及安全知识被视为竞争优势。

Conclusion: 提出激励数据共享的新方法，包括区分公共与私有知识、创新数据工具和共享管道，以及补偿数据整理成本。

Abstract: Safety-critical data, such as crash and near-crash records, are crucial to
improving autonomous vehicle (AV) design and development. Sharing such data
across AV companies, academic researchers, regulators, and the public can help
make all AVs safer. However, AV companies rarely share safety-critical data
externally. This paper aims to pinpoint why AV companies are reluctant to share
safety-critical data, with an eye on how these barriers can inform new
approaches to promote sharing. We interviewed twelve AV company employees who
actively work with such data in their day-to-day work. Findings suggest two
key, previously unknown barriers to data sharing: (1) Datasets inherently embed
salient knowledge that is key to improving AV safety and are
resource-intensive. Therefore, data sharing, even within a company, is fraught
with politics. (2) Interviewees believed AV safety knowledge is private
knowledge that brings competitive edges to their companies, rather than public
knowledge for social good. We discuss the implications of these findings for
incentivizing and enabling safety-critical AV data sharing, specifically,
implications for new approaches to (1) debating and stratifying public and
private AV safety knowledge, (2) innovating data tools and data sharing
pipelines that enable easier sharing of public AV safety data and knowledge;
(3) offsetting costs of curating safety-critical data and incentivizing data
sharing.

Abstract: This paper examines how graduate students develop frameworks for evaluating
machine-generated expertise in web-based interactions with large language
models (LLMs). Through a qualitative study combining surveys, LLM interaction
transcripts, and in-depth interviews with 14 graduate students, we identify
patterns in how these emerging professionals assess and engage with
AI-generated content. Our findings reveal that students construct evaluation
frameworks shaped by three main factors: professional identity, verification
capabilities, and system navigation experience. Rather than uniformly accepting
or rejecting LLM outputs, students protect domains central to their
professional identities while delegating others--with managers preserving
conceptual work, designers safeguarding creative processes, and programmers
maintaining control over core technical expertise. These evaluation frameworks
are further influenced by students' ability to verify different types of
content and their experience navigating complex systems. This research
contributes to web science by highlighting emerging human-genAI interaction
patterns and suggesting how platforms might better support users in developing
effective frameworks for evaluating machine-generated expertise signals in
AI-mediated web environments.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to
process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy
and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI
agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general
autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on
performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We
review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and
outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent
assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation
framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through
in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI
agent design and evaluation.

Method: 提出自适应流式方法，实时调整输出速度，基于认知负载估计。

Result: 方法可减少高达16.8%的计算消耗，同时保持用户体验。

Conclusion: 该策略为云对话AI提供了一种高效资源管理框架。

Abstract: Generative conversational interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
typically stream output token-by-token at a rate determined by computational
budget, often neglecting actual human reading speeds and the cognitive load
associated with the content. This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use
of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming
content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted
computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly
during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive
streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in
real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the
cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down
the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing
computational resources for other users. Our statistical analysis of
computational savings, combined with crowdsourced user studies, provides
insights into the trade-offs between service efficiency and user satisfaction,
demonstrating that our method can significantly reduce computational
consumption up to 16.8\%. This context-aware computational resource management
strategy presents a practical framework for enhancing system efficiency in
cloud-based conversational AI interfaces without compromising user experience.
